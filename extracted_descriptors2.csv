demon fish,goliath tigerfish,hydrocynus goliath,in an african river there lurks a super predator a creature with the combined strength speed and ferocity of all the river monsters i have ever encountered creating the most horrific yet perfect killing machine in all of the worlds rivers something bit this fish right in half my name is jeremy wade biologist and extreme fisherman im on the trail of this terrifying monster and its going to take all my skills as a fisherman to capture one child sings in local language this is a story from the heart of africa of a cursed beast that preys on the unsuspecting its powers are legendary its ferocity the stuff of nightmares on the banks of an african river a young girl is playing sings to herself she enters the water as she has done hundreds of times before around her waist is a belt made from shiny bottle caps what she doesnt know is that today in this spot there lurks a monster a creature of terrifying appearance like a relic from prehistoric times armed with bone-crunching jaws as powerful as a hyenas it is as secretive as a crocodile and as deadly as a great white shark sings softly this super predator is only found in the most inaccessible part of the most inaccessible river on earth very few outsiders have ever heard of it even many of the locals have never seen it im heading to central africa to the congo river to track down and catch one of these elusive killers to see if this creature really does deserve its reputation as a supreme underwater predator the first thing a fisherman does when he goes to a new place is to check out the river but nowhere else in the world would you expect to be greeted by a sight anything at all like this this massive river is second only in flow and area to the amazon draining a huge swathe of africa half the size of the us thats the congo river to reach this point it has run nearly miles crossed the equator twice and narrowed from ten miles at its widest to around a mile here where it splits the two war-ravaged capital cities of kinshasa and brazzaville from here it plummets nearly 1000ft in a series of rapids to the atlantic ocean almost miles away and wherever there is a river there are humans hard-wired to seek out its fish i meet up with wedda one of only a handful of fishermen that choose to fish these waters lovely little miniature fish here because this is a very delicate yes yes yes ive got two ive got two whoa look at this because this is a very very whippy bit of bamboo here you can actually feel these things going ding ding ding i got two two fish look at that my first fish in the congo fantastic kaki these are the kaki fish again thats exciting its always significant your first fish its hard to believe but many species of fish can survive fast-flowing rapids like these wedda is one of only a handful of fishermen who choose to fish these waters im seeing what the local guys use here im slightly embarrassed using such gear which is very expensive in comparison i actually think this will stand a chance of getting out large fish from here which the bamboo and lighter line doesnt do perhaps the creature im pursuing is a voracious predator theres the hook that not only attacks the small fish these fishermen are after but will also take a chunk out of a crocodile its the goliath tiger fish not just one of the top predators here but among the most ferocious freshwater predators in all the worlds rivers goliath tiger fish are said to grow six feet long and weigh well in excess of 100ibs they have jaws packed with razor-sharp interlocking teeth and with their streamlined body and huge tail they are capable of incredible bursts of speed when striking prey their ferocity when hunting is legendary the fishermen tell me theres someone i should meet who has a unique way of fishing these waters this is philippe tenta he fishes these rapids with a net that is the scale of a goliath tiger fish which he caught the day before yesterday - combien de kilo - trente kilo - trente kilo ici - oui whoo 70lbs here thats a big old tiger fish teeth on it probably like that you know so just the thought of that kind of fish in this kind of water you dont get much more extreme hes about to check his nets so youve got cable where its going over the rocks here we go heres the net coming in as would be expected fishing with nets in such turbulent water is not without its problems low chatter the nets actually its stuck i have no idea what he plans to do about it but i wasnt expecting that jumping into these waters is nothing short of suicidal but i realise now that this is something he must do on a daily basis if people call me an extreme fisherman what does that make him i know he knows what hes doing but to me it looks the most insanely dangerous way to make a living swimming in this super-sized washing machine-type water with a net which is designed to catch things all this effort and theres actually nothing in this net were just gonna redeploy a fresh net and it is just just mind-boggling you just wouldnt get me doing that that kind of fishing seems very reckless to me but this is a country where people are forced to go to extreme lengths simply to survive philippe tells me about a man whose father was attacked by a goliath tiger fish so i head to a suburb of brazzaville the capital of the republic of congo to meet jean-pierre montbeli a fisherman with a story to tell speaks in local language speaks in local language he shows me a macabre souvenir a scale that he took from the massive goliath tiger fish that attacked his father it sounds like he was a specialist fisherman for tiger fish he was fishing on his own he didnt come back one day and they are known to jump out of the water theyre very fast they have just these wickedly sharp teeth some time later they found the boat but with nobody in but there was a fish in the boat with a hook in its mouth when they looked some distance away his body was there as well the thing thats horrifying is it sounds like there were marks on his fathers throat it sounded like he was standing up in the boat a freak accident it sounded like the fish jumped out of the water and bit him on the throat montbelis story raises a few questions but this is the second account of a goliath tiger fish attacking and killing a person ive come down to the market which is something i always try and do the reason i do this is its just such a great clearing-house for information about boats fishermen and also about fish theres actually a fish in africa called the african bonytongue which is a relative of the arapaima which lives in the amazon its a bit like the way the piranhas are relatives of the goliath tiger fish here all this seems very strange the fact youve got relatives living thousands of miles apart but its all evidence of the fact that africa and south america used to be joined its a bit of an arms race down there in order to survive the fish have had to get tooled up sharp teeth poisonous spines and a bolt of electricity are all mechanisms that have evolved conversation in local language - makunga - makunga im starting to see some of the weird and wonderful fish from this river makunga this one argh oooh very toothy argh speaks local language this is an electric catfish this is an electric catfish its still alive he got his finger in its mouth ah the tail and thats ok ok ah but here zzzz ok ok but to stand any chance of catching a goliath i need to head upstream to a less-densely populated part of the river i want to see for myself if this fish deserves its reputation as an indiscriminate killer success in fishing is largely about preparation and i use the journey north to begin the groundwork catching the fish is about getting local intelligence theres no way you can get that without talking to people where im going theyre not gonna speak english having left the capital not many will speak french so im brushing up on my lingala which is the language they speak on the congo river its the trade language that everybody speaks as well as the other little local languages the goliath tiger fish is the ultimate freshwater predator combining characteristics from all the other river monsters ive ever battled it has the bloodthirsty reputation of the piranha dentition more fearsome than the payara the cunning of the wels catfish and the strength of the piraiba add to that the athleticism of the arapaima and a bony head to rival that of the alligator and its clear im going to have to draw on all of my past experiences to catch one basically ive got some pretty serious treble hooks ill be using this kind of wire if i used ordinary fishing line down to the hooks the goliath tiger fish will chomp through it so im using this kind of stuff its a breaking strain of 135lbs just miles upstream from brazzaville we arrive in the section of river where the young girl was attacked and killed by a goliath tiger fish but that was on the opposite bank in the democratic republic of congo and i dont have papers for the drc with the country still experiencing unrest i cant risk going there i stop and chat to some fishermen they show me a tiny goliath tiger fish that they have just caught it looks like a piranha but this is just a baby goliath tiger fish these things grow to the size of a person this confirms that it could be a good place to start fishing so weve got a lump of rock here a cliff some boulders at the bottom the current comes down gets deflected out into the middle and weve got this nice eddy here so im actually fishing off the back of the boat letting the back current take it but its classic ambush predator country ive got the bait about yards down from the boat im feeling hopeful something could take that - whizz of line unreeling - fish on fish on argh the bait went round the corner i lost sight of the float i lost sight of the float and i just pulled on the line i was retrieving it suddenly theres a wrench on the rod ah look at that thats tiger fish there we go - chung chung chung it would have had a really good mouthful of that of the hook as well but failed to get a good hook-up that fish was on for two or three seconds thats sort of par for the course with these fish but im just looking up the wire here you can see as it was running away the slime off the fish some of it left itself on the wire trace there so those are the tantalising clues about the fish that was on the end of this line which i never saw but its left a little bit of itself on the wire there a little further upriver is the village of maipili where i set up camp just pulling into a little village here one of these very large baleiniers they call them big whale boat on its way down river buying up firewood and charcoal by the look of it plus people jumping on for a lift as night draws in i m left to ponder my near miss i had the right spot but i had underestimated the animal it just spat out my treble hook with contempt ive been talking to some of the people here they say just use loads of those maybe ten on the line something will hold but its not just a case of the more the merrier i think that might hook something fairly well possibly but that amount of metalwear might actually put something off from actually coming along and taking the bait in the first place the other thing is if something grabs hold of that the pressure that im exerting is divided over nine points on the other hand something like that its a bit of compromise ive got a big treble hook on the end then ive got a single hook further up if just that single hook gets a hold ive got a lot of pressure that can actually work that into the bone of the fishs mouth the goliaths reputation as a fierce predator has immortalised it in local culture known by the congolese as mbenga it crops up again and again in tales of mutilation human death and sorcery the next day i head out with a more substantial rig ive got some artificial lures with me but everybody here tells me this predator is most likely to hit a bait that is alive speaks french ok goliath tiger fish are active hunters as well as having good eyesight they can detect vibrations in the water which can lead them to prey but does the mbenga intentionally target people or is there another reason to explain the attacks that ive heard about ive just got this on the clicker on the ratchet if its actually in the full current thats just pulling it away but the fact that that is just holding nicely is good its in a little quiet pocket of water relatively quiet out in the current thats what im looking for its where a predator would wait without expending much energy where theres not too much current just for future reference just getting a fix on where we are cos this is this just feels like a good spot right it might be off damn its off ahh no question about me putting pressure on that or not the float just shot under that fish was tearing away argh wow look at that look at that phew thats the kind of thing youd expect to see if youre shark fishing this is freshwater something down there just bit this fish in half one thing thats going through my mind ive heard stories of people getting attacked just looking at the state of this fish it really does make you realise what a mess that would make of a person if it went for your arm or your leg or anywhere else so far the numbers just arent in my favour not many people have really fished for these on rod and line but they say its three or four out of ten that you hook youll get in some people say its even less than that so for me its nought out of two so far sometimes they will actually jump in the early stages this one didnt jump it was just going deep the fish has left a slime trail up the trace there you go this line here is 200lb breaking strain no stretch i was just hanging on for all i was worth i mean its just such a fearsome creature in so many ways not just the force of the teeth but also the strength of the body which ive now felt like the girl i heard about who had a fish grab her torso sings the morning after im called to meet the village elders they have stories to tell me about attacks by mbenga on people from the village speaks french the story that is emerging is that if you live here and you go to the water every day then there are certain things that you should try not to do speaks french anything that goes in the water that moves creates a disturbance speaks french - if you put a baby in the water - speaks french it seems that the sound of splashing in the water attracts them but it wasnt just the sound that attracted it to the little girl who was killed across the river theyre being bitten on the hands and arms anything that shines a shiny watch or bracelet or something there is a risk on that day she was wearing a belt around her waist made from shiny bottle caps her waist is exactly where she was attacked it is only now when i find out why she was wearing the belt that the tragedy of this story becomes clear speaks french there is a type of traditional protection - it sounds like a wristlet or an amulet - speaks french - and it will protect you against carnivorous fish also hippopotamus crocodiles its sort of like a good-luck charm so i guess these are people who actually go to the water a lot they go there to fish to wash their clothes their pots and pans you never know whats within a few feet of you so in that kind of situation you need all the protection you can get the tragic irony of the girls death is that the belt was given to her by her parents to ward off evil spirits but it ended up attracting the predator that killed her fred has been my boatman for the past two weeks now he has helped me understand the spirituality that swirls around this region like the currents in the river together we fish every hour along huge stretches of the river but the fish seem to have vanished its as though they were never here i change location and i change rigs and bait but nothing i continue asking the locals and they direct me further north very few things are put down to accident or chance if youre bitten by a goliath tiger fish its because the spirit of a sorcerer was in that fish and it made the fish do that for some reason maybe someones put a curse on you for whatever reason when youre actually fishing for one and not catching one you actually do start to think that maybe this isnt a real fish at all maybe it is purely a mythological beast a figment of the collective imagination because at the moment there doesnt seem to be anything down there but i know it is more than a myth because everyone i speak to has a different story about somebody who has been attacked speaks french ive just asked if they know of anybody having any accidents with goliath tiger fish they were gesturing like this on the arm and on the leg and it sounds like further upriver it seems to be a common occurrence - there are people around who have been bitten by them men singing after weeks of no results its difficult to keep my focus but i have to because just one lapse in concentration and i could miss the chance when it comes this fish is basically a scaled-up piranha and once it gets to a case of being close quarters im going to have to be very careful im going to have to really watch my step and just take extreme care that is where this fishing just has a totally other dimension part of mes hoping that floats gonna disappear and the lines gonna go screaming out but part of mes thinking well ratchet whirs rapidly it might jump might jump watch that line on the rocks its a smaller one hey thats what they do thats what they do thats three takes and no fish three takes no fish thats so close so close so close so close this was a really lively bait ah yeah thats another fish frustrated groan im thinking with hindsight if id had more ironmongery in there that might have groans you know days and days go by nothing happens nothing happens and then one is there it just comes out of nowhere and its gone in a matter of seconds damn if i put this fish on just rigged up normally i could have had it i could have bloody had it if id had i think i need to get another bait out there pretty soon i dont know if weve got any good baits that was the good bait it is an odd thing about this fish it definitely does exist but you can almost reach a situation both myself and the local people where you sort of forget about it you think it doesnt exist because you dont see it you hear about it but you dont see it then suddenly its right in front of you and its tearing into flesh if i had one fish at least under my belt now i could accept this a bit philosophically but ive just been here now for so many days ive had three chances ive just caught nothing the whole time ive been here it really does feel like a it really does feel like a test of character and i feel that im failing at the moment it looks like im going to go home empty-handed having come all this way and that is just so demoralising its like the fish is taunting me almost the fish is theres just enough of a sign of the fish to get the hopes up and then just dashed i head back to the village knowing that i need more help if im not to go home empty-handed the elders tell me about an old man who not only protects them from danger but also brings them luck right this is the house of the feticheur the local the witch doctor speaks french his assistants appear first while we wait in silence for him to emerge i wonder if the man held in such reverence by the villagers will have the power to change my fortunes man cries out the people of central africa hold feticheurs like this man in very high regard his knowledge has been passed down over generations and his powers lie in his ability to call on the spirits he uses substances from the forest to create the potions speaks local language speaks french ah ok speaks local language i have no idea what this will involve but for a small payment im hoping he can change my fortunes what hes asking for is success in the fishing but also protection from the fish this is a dangerous fish ill try and get one of these fish and put it back alive but that does carry something of a risk its sort of a lucky charm im thinking im gonna need all the help i get in the next few days rattling speaks local language man speaks local language applause the ceremony finishes with the villagers thanking the spirits singing im still not too sure what to think about the ceremony with the witch doctor but if nothing else fred seems a lot happier sings its as though he knows something that i dont we head out with a renewed sense of purpose fred explains to me in more detail exactly what the witch doctor said he has consulted a spirit of a dead fisherman and he has said that the place to catch the fish is to come all the way up here from the village and then work down im actually quite superstitious at times you do something which actually technically has no bearing on your fishing but you have a good result and here i suppose its the equivalent of praying in a way talking to the ancestors if you do that and you have a good result or you return safely then youll keep doing that and you will believe that is the reason you return safely from your fishing trip the people of this village have spoken to the spirits on our behalf they say this is the place to come ive been here for three weeks now and ive had three hits but still nothing tangible to show for all my efforts whirs fish on fred the net ok ive got to just get a keep pressure from above cos theres rocks and ive got its gonna jump its gonna jump thats the float were gonna see the fish very soon gonna see it very soon there it is thats a good fish look at that the net the net the net careful fred careful careful careful right we want to be very careful now ready with the net we want to get the head in la tete la tete ooh securez la poisson bon ive got her ok what weve gotta worry about now is it biting its way out we got the fish we got the fish right now just a moment is there anything in this or not i put it in this morning like the feticheur said it was under my pillow today i took it with me fishing i want to do something that fishermen never do when they catch these - have a look at it then release it alive back into the river the mouth is going the fish is breathing good and the gills are going thats good this water is nicely aerated thats a good thing as well now those teeth that will take lumps out of other fish it will take lumps out of crocodiles and there are stories well documented about taking lumps out of people wow there we go what a freshwater monster this thing is what im looking at here is the ultimate piranha those teeth just like a piranhas triangular sharps blades down the side and they interlock almost like scissors they will just cut a lump out two big differences though one is piranhas hunt in packs this is a solitary hunter the other thing is the size people who think the piranhas are scary if they saw one of these things their nightmares might be populated by a slightly different animal one sort of diabolical anatomical detail on this fish is that it hasnt just got one hinge on its jaw its got a double hinge its got one hinge here its got another hinge there which enables it to open that jaw much wider so it can almost open like that and just come straight in and take a really huge bite out of its prey its just a murderous animal this thing this fish may look inactive now but once its revived a bit theres a danger it could slice me at any moment i actually dont want to let it go too soon even though theres a risk to me if i stay in the water too long beside it what i dont want is for this fish to swim into the powerful water and not be able to hold itself upright it will just roll belly-up and get battered on some of these rocks here so i want it to be completely recovered before it goes i want it to be able to swim off keeping itself vertical unaided - speaks french - ah oh yes - speaks french - no no no they speak french were having a discussion because fred thought that wed take it back to the village for everyone to eat - that is quite a nice idea - speaks french he tells me this fish has been given to us by god speaks french he said even for the feticheur who gave me the charm told me id have success in the fishing send him a piece of the meat its not just our village the people over the river have helped it would be it would make everybody happy but it wouldnt make me happy well it would in one way but it would make me more happy to put this back its gonna upset him as well if he sees this swim away im trying to explain the important thing for me is to see it and not to kill it i think its very important that animals that we find frightening in appearance that we try and understand them we dont just hack them to pieces and kill them and look at the body i want to look at this thing alive and then see it swim off if the fish dies because it has really exhausted itself fighting against me and in that very wild rocky water if the fish dies well take it back for everyone to eat if it recovers if it can support itself im going to let it go so we now just wait and see looking now at some of the marks on its head i think it bashed itself on the rocks while fighting with me its possible that it might die but what i wanna do is give it the best chance possible to me the mbenga ranks as one of the most difficult fish ive ever caught but i dont think it deserves its reputation as an indiscriminate killer each attack involves splashes or bright shiny objects in the water which to a goliath tiger fish resembles its normal food - other fish - and it responds in the only way that it knows after an hour the decision is taken from me as i feel the life slipping away from this monster no its not going to make it so i mean the good thing is although the fish has died it wont be going to waste to the people of the congo the mbenga is much more than just a fish it is a spirit that pervades their folklore yet many people here i now realise have never seen this monster in the flesh grunts with effort i begin to suspect that for fred returning this fish would have meant much more than just losing a meal excited shouting bringing this fish out of the shadows into the light of day has been a monumental task its easy to tell myself now that my success was down to my persistence but i still wonder how much was down to factors outside my control or understanding no no ok whoa cheering excited chatter its never good when a fish dies but you know when it gets that kind of reaction when you bring it in thats a big meal for lots of people theres over people in this village and theyll all have a piece a lot of them wont have seen a fish like that or not a good-size one theyve heard about it it is a legend but they dont see them very often so you know if a fish has to die or a fish does die at least a reaction like that is some sort of compensation its not the ending that i wanted but it is fitting in a way cheering,hydrocynus goliath also known as the goliath tigerfish giant tigerfish or mbenga is a very large african predatory freshwater fish of the family alestidae distribution goliath tigerfish hydrocynus goliath is one of five recognized african species of the hydrocynus genus and is found in the congo river basin including lualaba river and lake upemba and lake tanganyika the type locality is the city of mbandaka in the main congo where it was discovered in by french explorer boulenger they are typically found in highly oxygenated fast-flowing waters such as those found in deep river channels and open lakes making them strong swimmers able to capture prey even in turbulent waters a study which reconstructs the phylogenetic history of genus hydrocynus using comparisons of a protein-coding gene called cytochrome b revealed several mtdna clades in this region suggesting a higher tigerfish species richness than traditionally recognized the studys analyses indicate that populations of h goliath may have been prevented from upstream dispersal in the geologic past by knickpoints or sharp changes in the channel bed slope in the luvua river this prevention of upstream dispersal would restrict h goliath to the congo river basin as reflected in the modern range of the species four additional species h vittatus and three unknown species appear to be present in this basin while two h vittatus and an unknown species appear to be present in lake tanganyika based on the studys sequence comparisons h goliath possesses low nucleotide diversity suggesting that existing populations originate from a historically small effective population which underwent rapid population growth at some point in the past additionally a high haplotype diversity value indicates that its expansion may have undergone a more recent expansion in its population range and size description the goliath tigerfish has a characteristic silvery gray dorsum and flanks with a thunniform body plan similar to that of tuna featuring black adipose fins the goliath tigerfish is described as the monster fish of the congo by a documentary by national geographic a reflection of its monster-like qualities and of its perception by local people and hunters this large-toothed highly predatory fish grows to an average length of m ft and a weight of kg lb the largest recorded specimen weighed kg lb and they can reach a maximum recorded length of about m ft making them the largest of the tigerfish of genus hydrocynus in addition to being the largest in body size of their genus they also have incredibly large conical teeth due to their predatory nature they possess well-developed pharyngeal teeth similar to those of sharks and piranhastheir teeth are spaced out along the jaw and shaped like daggers in order to facilitate biting pieces out of prey fish or tearing prey into smaller pieces for digestion the premaxilla holds six to seven teeth while the dentary or lower jaw holds five for a total of to upper teeth plus to lower teeth its teeth fit into distinct grooves along its jaws interlocking together with the smallest teeth found at the very back of the jaws in each jaw quadrant all teeth are replaced at the same time over the course of about five days on average each of its teeth can grow up to cm in according to biologist and television presenter jeremy wade which is comparable to the tooth size of a great white shark these massive jaws and teeth are what sets this species apart from all other tigerfish of the genus hydrocynus and make for easy identification especially given its endemism to the congo basin reproduction despite being mostly solitary hunters female goliath tigerfish migrate together and breed near each other on riverbanks or lakeshores thousands of eggs are laid among thick vegetation to protect the eggs and the young from predators given that goliath tigerfish are not attentive parents infant fish feed on animal plankton during their larval stage before transitioning to small fish and eventually an adult diet of larger fish juvenile fish grow quite slowly averaging four to six inches of growth per year it can take up to ten years for a juvenile tigerfish to reach its full adult size diet hydrocynus goliath is a piscivore feeding on any fish it can overpower including smaller members of the same species their huge powerful rigid teeth make them one of the most ferocious predators of the congo basin dangerous for the smaller fish they prey on as well as for the hunters who attempt to capture them for sport and for food they have been known to attack larger animals taking chunks out of large fish crocodiles humans or even each other in desperate times when hunting this fish uses the calmer eddies of the rapids to ambush its prey using its keen sight to detect prey when a target is noticed the fish accelerates to chase it down the nile crocodile is the only known natural predator of mature goliath tigerfish humans are also considered predators as they hunt tigerfish for food and sport interaction with and significance to humans a number of incidents have been reported in the congo of this fish attacking humans this reputation combined with its strength has earned it an almost mythical status among anglers and it has been called the greatest freshwater gamefish in the world hunters and fishermen in the congo river basin often spend entire days battling these huge fish its enormous size and shearing teeth make it powerful and difficult to capture earning it the title of one of the worlds greatest sports fishing challenges in sports fishing magazines throughout the congo the goliath tigerfish is known by its native swahilli name mbenga which translates to dangerous fish native people believe the fish to be an evil spirit which is to be avoided especially at the start of a journey on water the goliath tigerfish is one of many fishes that plays an important role in the diet and economy of african countries in the central african republic a study investigates how to manage infestations of dermestes beetles in the dried fishes which are crucial for supplying protein to central africans the study shows that tigerfish are susceptible to the development of dermestes with considerable losses to the fish product as it eats through the skin lays larvae and contaminates the fish as a food source infestation of dried fishes comes with financial loss for central and south african economies with an estimated annual loss of 1000000 usd in south africa specifically dried fish carrying the dermestes and their larvae can go on to damage timber cotton linen and other materials though methods of prevention through traditional management of dried fishes were investigated the development of the dermestes subspecies found in dried tigerfish has not yet been effectively reduced in addition to pests bacteria is commonly found in dried tigerfish to combat this many sellers use either traditional methods or toxic pesticides that increase the shelf life researchers recommend further study regarding the specific bacterial concentrations at each stage of the processing of dried fish as well as training for the sellers regarding safer handling practices in the home aquarium the goliath tigerfish is sometimes kept as a display fish in home aquarium setups however due to their enormous size often times reaching over in mm in length they are not suitable except among the most experienced fishkeepers with the ability to house them the recommended size of such a tank setup would be around us gallons they are predatory fish with razor sharp teeth and are hostile to most other inhabitants its recommended to keep them alone or with larger and more boisterous species that can hold their own against the tiger fish when feeding this massive fish will only feed on live prey making feeding them difficult conservation status the current conservation status of the goliath tigerfish is unknown but it is listed as least concern according to the iucn red lists assessment references external links goliath tigerfish the proceedings of the ever so strange

strength speed and ferocity of all the river monsters i have ever encountered creating the most horrific yet perfect killing machine in all of the worlds rivers something bit this fish right in half my name is jeremy wade biologist and extreme fisherman im on the trail of this terrifying monster and its going to take all my skills as a fisherman to capture one child sings in local language this is a story from the heart of africa of a cursed beast that preys on the unsuspecting its powers are legendary its ferocity the stuff of nightmares on the banks of an african river a young girl is playing sings to herself she enters the water as she has done hundreds of times before around her waist is a belt made from shiny bottle caps*****************she doesnt know is that today in this spot there lurks a monster a creature of terrifying appearance like a relic from prehistoric times armed with bone-crunching jaws as powerful as a hyenas it is as secretive as a crocodile and as deadly as a great white shark sings softly this super predator is only found in the most inaccessible part of the most inaccessible river on earth very few outsiders have ever heard of it even many of the locals have never seen it im heading to central africa to the congo river to track down and catch one of these elusive killers to see if this creature really does deserve its reputation as a supreme underwater predator*****************first thing a fisherman does when he goes to a new place is to check out the river but nowhere else in the world would you expect to be greeted by a sight anything at all like this this massive river is second only in flow and area to the amazon draining a huge swathe of africa half the size of the us thats the congo river to reach this point it has run nearly miles crossed the equator twice and narrowed from ten miles at its widest to around a mile here where it splits the two war-ravaged capital cities of kinshasa and brazzaville from here it plummets nearly 1000ft in a series of rapids to the atlantic*****************almost miles away and wherever there is a river there are humans hard-wired to seek out its fish i meet up with wedda one of only a handful of fishermen that choose to fish these waters lovely little miniature fish here because this is a very delicate yes yes yes ive got two ive got two whoa look at this because this is a very very whippy bit of bamboo here you can actually feel these things going ding ding ding i got two two fish look at that my first fish in the congo fantastic kaki these are the kaki fish again thats exciting its always significant your first fish its hard to believe but many species of*****************can survive fast-flowing rapids like these wedda is one of only a handful of fishermen who choose to fish these waters im seeing what the local guys use here im slightly embarrassed using such gear which is very expensive in comparison i actually think this will stand a chance of getting out large fish from here which the bamboo and lighter line doesnt do perhaps the creature im pursuing is a voracious predator theres the hook that not only attacks the small fish these fishermen are after but will also take a chunk out of a crocodile its the goliath tiger fish not just one of the top predators here but among the most ferocious freshwater predators in all*****************worlds rivers goliath tiger fish are said to grow six feet long and weigh well in excess of 100ibs they have jaws packed with razor-sharp interlocking teeth and with their streamlined body and huge tail they are capable of incredible bursts of speed when striking prey their ferocity when hunting is legendary the fishermen tell me theres someone i should meet who has a unique way of fishing these waters this is philippe tenta he fishes these rapids with a net that is the scale of a goliath tiger fish which he caught the day before yesterday - combien de kilo - trente kilo - trente kilo ici - oui whoo 70lbs here thats a big old tiger fish*****************on it probably like that you know so just the thought of that kind of fish in this kind of water you dont get much more extreme hes about to check his nets so youve got cable where its going over the rocks here we go heres the net coming in as would be expected fishing with nets in such turbulent water is not without its problems low chatter the nets actually its stuck i have no idea what he plans to do about it but i wasnt expecting that jumping into these waters is nothing short of suicidal but i realise now that this is something he must do on a daily basis if people call me an*****************fisherman what does that make him i know he knows what hes doing but to me it looks the most insanely dangerous way to make a living swimming in this super-sized washing machine-type water with a net which is designed to catch things all this effort and theres actually nothing in this net were just gonna redeploy a fresh net and it is just just mind-boggling you just wouldnt get me doing that that kind of fishing seems very reckless to me but this is a country where people are forced to go to extreme lengths simply to survive philippe tells me about a man whose father was attacked by a goliath tiger fish so i head to a*****************of brazzaville the capital of the republic of congo to meet jean-pierre montbeli a fisherman with a story to tell speaks in local language speaks in local language he shows me a macabre souvenir a scale that he took from the massive goliath tiger fish that attacked his father it sounds like he was a specialist fisherman for tiger fish he was fishing on his own he didnt come back one day and they are known to jump out of the water theyre very fast they have just these wickedly sharp teeth some time later they found the boat but with nobody in but there was a fish in the boat with a hook in its mouth when they*****************some distance away his body was there as well the thing thats horrifying is it sounds like there were marks on his fathers throat it sounded like he was standing up in the boat a freak accident it sounded like the fish jumped out of the water and bit him on the throat montbelis story raises a few questions but this is the second account of a goliath tiger fish attacking and killing a person ive come down to the market which is something i always try and do the reason i do this is its just such a great clearing-house for information about boats fishermen and also about fish theres actually a fish in africa called the african*****************which is a relative of the arapaima which lives in the amazon its a bit like the way the piranhas are relatives of the goliath tiger fish here all this seems very strange the fact youve got relatives living thousands of miles apart but its all evidence of the fact that africa and south america used to be joined its a bit of an arms race down there in order to survive the fish have had to get tooled up sharp teeth poisonous spines and a bolt of electricity are all mechanisms that have evolved conversation in local language - makunga - makunga im starting to see some of the weird and wonderful fish from this river makunga this*****************argh oooh very toothy argh speaks local language this is an electric catfish this is an electric catfish its still alive he got his finger in its mouth ah the tail and thats ok ok ah but here zzzz ok ok but to stand any chance of catching a goliath i need to head upstream to a less-densely populated part of the river i want to see for myself if this fish deserves its reputation as an indiscriminate killer success in fishing is largely about preparation and i use the journey north to begin the groundwork catching the fish is about getting local intelligence theres no way you can get that without talking to people where im going theyre*****************gonna speak english having left the capital not many will speak french so im brushing up on my lingala which is the language they speak on the congo river its the trade language that everybody speaks as well as the other little local languages the goliath tiger fish is the ultimate freshwater predator combining characteristics from all the other river monsters ive ever battled it has the bloodthirsty reputation of the piranha dentition more fearsome than the payara the cunning of the wels catfish and the strength of the piraiba add to that the athleticism of the arapaima and a bony head to rival that of the alligator and its clear im going to have to draw on all*****************my past experiences to catch one basically ive got some pretty serious treble hooks ill be using this kind of wire if i used ordinary fishing line down to the hooks the goliath tiger fish will chomp through it so im using this kind of stuff its a breaking strain of 135lbs just miles upstream from brazzaville we arrive in the section of river where the young girl was attacked and killed by a goliath tiger fish but that was on the opposite bank in the democratic republic of congo and i dont have papers for the drc with the country still experiencing unrest i cant risk going there i stop and chat to some fishermen they show me*****************tiny goliath tiger fish that they have just caught it looks like a piranha but this is just a baby goliath tiger fish these things grow to the size of a person this confirms that it could be a good place to start fishing so weve got a lump of rock here a cliff some boulders at the bottom the current comes down gets deflected out into the middle and weve got this nice eddy here so im actually fishing off the back of the boat letting the back current take it but its classic ambush predator country ive got the bait about yards down from the boat im feeling hopeful something could take that - whizz of line*****************- fish on fish on argh the bait went round the corner i lost sight of the float i lost sight of the float and i just pulled on the line i was retrieving it suddenly theres a wrench on the rod ah look at that thats tiger fish there we go - chung chung chung it would have had a really good mouthful of that of the hook as well but failed to get a good hook-up that fish was on for two or three seconds thats sort of par for the course with these fish but im just looking up the wire here you can see as it was running away the slime off the fish some*****************it left itself on the wire trace there so those are the tantalising clues about the fish that was on the end of this line which i never saw but its left a little bit of itself on the wire there a little further upriver is the village of maipili where i set up camp just pulling into a little village here one of these very large baleiniers they call them big whale boat on its way down river buying up firewood and charcoal by the look of it plus people jumping on for a lift as night draws in i m left to ponder my near miss i had the right spot but i had underestimated the animal*****************is divided over nine points on the other hand something like that its a bit of compromise ive got a big treble hook on the end then ive got a single hook further up if just that single hook gets a hold ive got a lot of pressure that can actually work that into the bone of the fishs mouth the goliaths reputation as a fierce predator has immortalised it in local culture known by the congolese as mbenga it crops up again and again in tales of mutilation human death and sorcery the next day i head out with a more substantial rig ive got some artificial lures with me but everybody here tells me this predator is most likely to hit a bait that is alive speaks french ok goliath tiger fish are active hunters as well as having good eyesight they can detect vibrations in the water*****************can lead them to prey but does the mbenga intentionally target people or is there another reason to explain the attacks that ive heard about ive just got this on the clicker on the ratchet if its actually in the full current thats just pulling it away but the fact that that is just holding nicely is good its in a little quiet pocket of water relatively quiet out in the current thats what im looking for its where a predator would wait without expending much energy where theres not too much current just for future reference just getting a fix on where we are cos this is this just feels like a good spot right it might be*****************damn its off ahh no question about me putting pressure on that or not the float just shot under that fish was tearing away argh wow look at that look at that phew thats the kind of thing youd expect to see if youre shark fishing this is freshwater something down there just bit this fish in half one thing thats going through my mind ive heard stories of people getting attacked just looking at the state of this fish it really does make you realise what a mess that would make of a person if it went for your arm or your leg or anywhere else so far the numbers just arent in my favour not many people*****************really fished for these on rod and line but they say its three or four out of ten that you hook youll get in some people say its even less than that so for me its nought out of two so far sometimes they will actually jump in the early stages this one didnt jump it was just going deep the fish has left a slime trail up the trace there you go this line here is 200lb breaking strain no stretch i was just hanging on for all i was worth i mean its just such a fearsome creature in so many ways not just the force of the teeth but also the strength of the body which*****************now felt like the girl i heard about who had a fish grab her torso sings the morning after im called to meet the village elders they have stories to tell me about attacks by mbenga on people from the village speaks french the story that is emerging is that if you live here and you go to the water every day then there are certain things that you should try not to do speaks french anything that goes in the water that moves creates a disturbance speaks french - if you put a baby in the water - speaks french it seems that the sound of splashing in the water attracts them but it wasnt just the sound*****************attracted it to the little girl who was killed across the river theyre being bitten on the hands and arms anything that shines a shiny watch or bracelet or something there is a risk on that day she was wearing a belt around her waist made from shiny bottle caps her waist is exactly where she was attacked it is only now when i find out why she was wearing the belt that the tragedy of this story becomes clear speaks french there is a type of traditional protection - it sounds like a wristlet or an amulet - speaks french - and it will protect you against carnivorous fish also hippopotamus crocodiles its sort of like a good-luck*****************so i guess these are people who actually go to the water a lot they go there to fish to wash their clothes their pots and pans you never know whats within a few feet of you so in that kind of situation you need all the protection you can get the tragic irony of the girls death is that the belt was given to her by her parents to ward off evil spirits but it ended up attracting the predator that killed her fred has been my boatman for the past two weeks now he has helped me understand the spirituality that swirls around this region like the currents in the river together we fish every hour along*****************stretches of the river but the fish seem to have vanished its as though they were never here i change location and i change rigs and bait but nothing i continue asking the locals and they direct me further north very few things are put down to accident or chance if youre bitten by a goliath tiger fish its because the spirit of a sorcerer was in that fish and it made the fish do that for some reason maybe someones put a curse on you for whatever reason when youre actually fishing for one and not catching one you actually do start to think that maybe this isnt a real fish at all maybe it is purely a*****************beast a figment of the collective imagination because at the moment there doesnt seem to be anything down there but i know it is more than a myth because everyone i speak to has a different story about somebody who has been attacked speaks french ive just asked if they know of anybody having any accidents with goliath tiger fish they were gesturing like this on the arm and on the leg and it sounds like further upriver it seems to be a common occurrence - there are people around who have been bitten by them men singing after weeks of no results its difficult to keep my focus but i have to because just one lapse in concentration*****************i could miss the chance when it comes this fish is basically a scaled-up piranha and once it gets to a case of being close quarters im going to have to be very careful im going to have to really watch my step and just take extreme care that is where this fishing just has a totally other dimension part of mes hoping that floats gonna disappear and the lines gonna go screaming out but part of mes thinking well ratchet whirs rapidly it might jump might jump watch that line on the rocks its a smaller one hey thats what they do thats what they do thats three takes and no fish three takes no fish thats so*****************so close so close so close this was a really lively bait ah yeah thats another fish frustrated groan im thinking with hindsight if id had more ironmongery in there that might have groans you know days and days go by nothing happens nothing happens and then one is there it just comes out of nowhere and its gone in a matter of seconds damn if i put this fish on just rigged up normally i could have had it i could have bloody had it if id had i think i need to get another bait out there pretty soon i dont know if weve got any good baits that was the good bait it is an odd*****************about this fish it definitely does exist but you can almost reach a situation both myself and the local people where you sort of forget about it you think it doesnt exist because you dont see it you hear about it but you dont see it then suddenly its right in front of you and its tearing into flesh if i had one fish at least under my belt now i could accept this a bit philosophically but ive just been here now for so many days ive had three chances ive just caught nothing the whole time ive been here it really does feel like a it really does feel like a test of character and i feel*****************im failing at the moment it looks like im going to go home empty-handed having come all this way and that is just so demoralising its like the fish is taunting me almost the fish is theres just enough of a sign of the fish to get the hopes up and then just dashed i head back to the village knowing that i need more help if im not to go home empty-handed the elders tell me about an old man who not only protects them from danger but also brings them luck right this is the house of the feticheur the local the witch doctor speaks french his assistants appear first while we wait in silence for him*****************emerge i wonder if the man held in such reverence by the villagers will have the power to change my fortunes man cries out the people of central africa hold feticheurs like this man in very high regard his knowledge has been passed down over generations and his powers lie in his ability to call on the spirits he uses substances from the forest to create the potions speaks local language speaks french ah ok speaks local language i have no idea what this will involve but for a small payment im hoping he can change my fortunes what hes asking for is success in the fishing but also protection from the fish this is a dangerous fish ill*****************and get one of these fish and put it back alive but that does carry something of a risk its sort of a lucky charm im thinking im gonna need all the help i get in the next few days rattling speaks local language man speaks local language applause the ceremony finishes with the villagers thanking the spirits singing im still not too sure what to think about the ceremony with the witch doctor but if nothing else fred seems a lot happier sings its as though he knows something that i dont we head out with a renewed sense of purpose fred explains to me in more detail exactly what the witch doctor said he has consulted a*****************of a dead fisherman and he has said that the place to catch the fish is to come all the way up here from the village and then work down im actually quite superstitious at times you do something which actually technically has no bearing on your fishing but you have a good result and here i suppose its the equivalent of praying in a way talking to the ancestors if you do that and you have a good result or you return safely then youll keep doing that and you will believe that is the reason you return safely from your fishing trip the people of this village have spoken to the spirits on our behalf they say*****************is the place to come ive been here for three weeks now and ive had three hits but still nothing tangible to show for all my efforts whirs fish on fred the net ok ive got to just get a keep pressure from above cos theres rocks and ive got its gonna jump its gonna jump thats the float were gonna see the fish very soon gonna see it very soon there it is thats a good fish look at that the net the net the net careful fred careful careful careful right we want to be very careful now ready with the net we want to get the head in la tete la tete ooh securez la poisson*****************ive got her ok what weve gotta worry about now is it biting its way out we got the fish we got the fish right now just a moment is there anything in this or not i put it in this morning like the feticheur said it was under my pillow today i took it with me fishing i want to do something that fishermen never do when they catch these - have a look at it then release it alive back into the river the mouth is going the fish is breathing good and the gills are going thats good this water is nicely aerated thats a good thing as well now those teeth that will take lumps*****************of other fish it will take lumps out of crocodiles and there are stories well documented about taking lumps out of people wow there we go what a freshwater monster this thing is what im looking at here is the ultimate piranha those teeth just like a piranhas triangular sharps blades down the side and they interlock almost like scissors they will just cut a lump out two big differences though one is piranhas hunt in packs this is a solitary hunter the other thing is the size people who think the piranhas are scary if they saw one of these things their nightmares might be populated by a slightly different animal one sort of diabolical anatomical detail on*****************fish is that it hasnt just got one hinge on its jaw its got a double hinge its got one hinge here its got another hinge there which enables it to open that jaw much wider so it can almost open like that and just come straight in and take a really huge bite out of its prey its just a murderous animal this thing this fish may look inactive now but once its revived a bit theres a danger it could slice me at any moment i actually dont want to let it go too soon even though theres a risk to me if i stay in the water too long beside it what i dont want is*****************this fish to swim into the powerful water and not be able to hold itself upright it will just roll belly-up and get battered on some of these rocks here so i want it to be completely recovered before it goes i want it to be able to swim off keeping itself vertical unaided - speaks french - ah oh yes - speaks french - no no no they speak french were having a discussion because fred thought that wed take it back to the village for everyone to eat - that is quite a nice idea - speaks french he tells me this fish has been given to us by god speaks french he said even for the*****************who gave me the charm told me id have success in the fishing send him a piece of the meat its not just our village the people over the river have helped it would be it would make everybody happy but it wouldnt make me happy well it would in one way but it would make me more happy to put this back its gonna upset him as well if he sees this swim away im trying to explain the important thing for me is to see it and not to kill it i think its very important that animals that we find frightening in appearance that we try and understand them we dont just hack them to pieces*****************kill them and look at the body i want to look at this thing alive and then see it swim off if the fish dies because it has really exhausted itself fighting against me and in that very wild rocky water if the fish dies well take it back for everyone to eat if it recovers if it can support itself im going to let it go so we now just wait and see looking now at some of the marks on its head i think it bashed itself on the rocks while fighting with me its possible that it might die but what i wanna do is give it the best chance possible to me the mbenga ranks*****************one of the most difficult fish ive ever caught but i dont think it deserves its reputation as an indiscriminate killer each attack involves splashes or bright shiny objects in the water which to a goliath tiger fish resembles its normal food - other fish - and it responds in the only way that it knows after an hour the decision is taken from me as i feel the life slipping away from this monster no its not going to make it so i mean the good thing is although the fish has died it wont be going to waste to the people of the congo the mbenga is much more than just a fish it is a spirit*****************pervades their folklore yet many people here i now realise have never seen this monster in the flesh grunts with effort i begin to suspect that for fred returning this fish would have meant much more than just losing a meal excited shouting bringing this fish out of the shadows into the light of day has been a monumental task its easy to tell myself now that my success was down to my persistence but i still wonder how much was down to factors outside my control or understanding no no ok whoa cheering excited chatter its never good when a fish dies but you know when it gets that kind of reaction when you bring it in thats*****************big meal for lots of people theres over people in this village and theyll all have a piece a lot of them wont have seen a fish like that or not a good-size one theyve heard about it it is a legend but they dont see them very often so you know if a fish has to die or a fish does die at least a reaction like that is some sort of compensation its not the ending that i wanted but it is fitting in a way cheering,hydrocynus goliath also known as the goliath tigerfish giant tigerfish or mbenga is a very large african predatory freshwater fish of the family alestidae distribution goliath tigerfish hydrocynus goliath is one of five recognized african species of the hydrocynus genus and is found in the congo river basin including lualaba river and lake upemba and lake tanganyika the type locality is the city of mbandaka in the main congo where it was discovered in by french explorer boulenger they are*****************found in highly oxygenated fast-flowing waters such as those found in deep river channels and open lakes making them strong swimmers able to capture prey even in turbulent waters a study which reconstructs the phylogenetic history of genus hydrocynus using comparisons of a protein-coding gene called cytochrome b revealed several mtdna clades in this region suggesting a higher tigerfish species richness than traditionally recognized*****************studys analyses indicate that populations of h goliath may have been prevented from upstream dispersal in the geologic past by knickpoints or sharp changes in the channel bed slope in the luvua river this prevention of upstream dispersal would restrict h goliath to the congo river basin as reflected in the modern range of the species four additional species h vittatus and three unknown*****************growth at some point in the past additionally a high haplotype diversity value indicates that its expansion may have undergone a more recent expansion in its population range and size description the goliath tigerfish has a characteristic silvery gray dorsum and flanks with a thunniform body plan similar to that of tuna featuring black adipose fins the goliath tigerfish is described as the monster fish of the congo by a documentary by national geographic a reflection of its monster-like qualities*****************of its perception by local people and hunters this large-toothed highly predatory fish grows to an average length of m ft and a weight of kg lb the largest recorded specimen weighed kg lb and they can reach a maximum recorded length of about m ft making them the largest of the tigerfish of genus hydrocynus in addition to being the largest in body*****************of their genus they also have incredibly large conical teeth due to their predatory nature they possess well-developed pharyngeal teeth similar to those of sharks and piranhastheir teeth are spaced out along the jaw and shaped like daggers in order to facilitate biting pieces out of prey fish or tearing prey into smaller pieces for digestion the premaxilla holds six to seven teeth while*****************dentary or lower jaw holds five for a total of to upper teeth plus to lower teeth its teeth fit into distinct grooves along its jaws interlocking together with the smallest teeth found at the very back of the jaws in each jaw quadrant all teeth are replaced at the same time over the course of about five days on average each of its*****************can grow up to cm in according to biologist and television presenter jeremy wade which is comparable to the tooth size of a great white shark these massive jaws and teeth are what sets this species apart from all other tigerfish of the genus hydrocynus and make for easy identification especially given its endemism to the congo basin reproduction despite being mostly solitary hunters*****************goliath tigerfish migrate together and breed near each other on riverbanks or lakeshores thousands of eggs are laid among thick vegetation to protect the eggs and the young from predators given that goliath tigerfish are not attentive parents infant fish feed on animal plankton during their larval stage before transitioning to small fish and eventually an adult diet of larger fish juvenile fish grow*****************slowly averaging four to six inches of growth per year it can take up to ten years for a juvenile tigerfish to reach its full adult size diet hydrocynus goliath is a piscivore feeding on any fish it can overpower including smaller members of the same species their huge powerful rigid teeth make them one of the most ferocious predators of the congo basin*****************for the smaller fish they prey on as well as for the hunters who attempt to capture them for sport and for food they have been known to attack larger animals taking chunks out of large fish crocodiles humans or even each other in desperate times when hunting this fish uses the calmer eddies of the rapids to ambush its prey using its keen*****************to detect prey when a target is noticed the fish accelerates to chase it down the nile crocodile is the only known natural predator of mature goliath tigerfish humans are also considered predators as they hunt tigerfish for food and sport interaction with and significance to humans a number of incidents have been reported in the congo of this fish attacking humans this reputation*****************with its strength has earned it an almost mythical status among anglers and it has been called the greatest freshwater gamefish in the world hunters and fishermen in the congo river basin often spend entire days battling these huge fish its enormous size and shearing teeth make it powerful and difficult to capture earning it the title of one of the worlds greatest sports*****************challenges in sports fishing magazines throughout the congo the goliath tigerfish is known by its native swahilli name mbenga which translates to dangerous fish native people believe the fish to be an evil spirit which is to be avoided especially at the start of a journey on water the goliath tigerfish is one of many fishes that plays an important role in the diet*****************economy of african countries in the central african republic a study investigates how to manage infestations of dermestes beetles in the dried fishes which are crucial for supplying protein to central africans the study shows that tigerfish are susceptible to the development of dermestes with considerable losses to the fish product as it eats through the skin lays larvae and contaminates the fish as*****************food source infestation of dried fishes comes with financial loss for central and south african economies with an estimated annual loss of usd in south africa specifically dried fish carrying the dermestes and their larvae can go on to damage timber cotton linen and other materials though methods of prevention through traditional management of dried fishes were investigated the development of the dermestes subspecies*****************in dried tigerfish has not yet been effectively reduced in addition to pests bacteria is commonly found in dried tigerfish to combat this many sellers use either traditional methods or toxic pesticides that increase the shelf life researchers recommend further study regarding the specific bacterial concentrations at each stage of the processing of dried fish as well as training for the sellers regarding safer*****************practices in the home aquarium the goliath tigerfish is sometimes kept as a display fish in home aquarium setups however due to their enormous size often times reaching over in mm in length they are not suitable except among the most experienced fishkeepers with the ability to house them the recommended size of such a tank setup would be around us gallons they are*****************fish with razor sharp teeth and are hostile to most other inhabitants its recommended to keep them alone or with larger and more boisterous species that can hold their own against the tiger fish when feeding this massive fish will only feed on live

death ray,giant freshwater stingray,urogymnus polylepis,im jeremy wade biologist and extreme angler from the depths of the amazon to the suburbs of berlin ive been busy tracking down the worlds most frightening freshwater fish and uncovering the truth about their evil reputations its taking line thats taking line ive tangled with man-eating catfish this is the one that goes after people as well swum with piranhas and grappled with ferocious gar agh my next assignment is a beast of terrifying power its spinning the boat its taking the boat down some people say this is the worlds biggest freshwater fish if my line jams it could pull me in this is a monster that can stab you with an eight-inch bayonet its flesh-dissolving venom has no known antidote just catching this fish will test me to the limit but my aim isnt simply to measure one of these giants i also want to know where it lives and how dangerous it really is - ive a feeling this could be - agh - my toughest challenge yet - here it comes here it comes i think were going to need a bigger boat in just the past few years a strange and possibly deadly creature has come out of the shadows ive read dramatic accounts of epic six-hour battles and heard that this predator can inflict horrendous wounds some people are even claiming that this little-known beast is the worlds biggest freshwater fish the name of this monster is himantura chaophraya the giant freshwater stingray shaped like a ufo this southeast asian giant is said to grow to 16ft long and 7ft across some sources put its weight at over 1300ibs even this basic information is very hard to verify it all sounds incredibly impressive but how much of this stuff can i really believe it seems that no-one knows how big this thing actually grows or why ive encountered river stingrays before a thousand miles up the amazon here theyre known as wish you were dead fish because of their agonisingly painful sting but these stingrays are relatively small the thought of a 16-footer sends a real shiver down my spine these are some examples of the wounds caused by marine stingrays typically what youre talking about is a very deep puncture wound normally to the foot or the lower leg but sometimes higher up and the people generally talk about this as being extremely painful as well as the actual immediate wound you have this very long-lasting effect of tissue necrosis its just a very painful messy wound heres one from new zealand you can see here that the barbs are actually still embedded in the leg the bit you can see is probably about five maybe six inches long this is in the upper leg this person was very lucky if that had been a little bit further round that could have punctured the femoral artery that could have been a fatal wound that could have killed him note to self dont get stung this is the barb from a stingray actually quite a small one but you get the general idea the barb sits on top of the tail and it whips it over its back a bit like a scorpion or it can also whip it round to either side and looking at this you can just see just how wickedly sharp that point is the second thing is youve got these grooves running underneath that is for delivering the venom from the gland at the base here but also for making it a more efficient stabbing weapon youll see exactly the same thing on a bayonet or a combat knife and the third thing looking closely at this you see these serrations along the edge here and it works on the same principle as an arrowhead it goes in very cleanly but you know its going to make a real mess when you pull it out imagine being stabbed by a large steak knife only this ones smeared with poison and it really shreds your flesh when it comes out yep ive heard that the giant freshwater stingray has a barb that is eight inches long which is a really sobering thought im quite curious to have a look at one of those hopefully not too close its not something i want to bring back as a souvenir in my leg my quest for the giant freshwater stingray takes me to southeast asia first to thailands capital bangkok surprisingly this huge and potentially lethal monster lives right under our noses normally when looking for underwater monsters youre thinking hundreds of miles upriver in remote wilderness but not this time im literally taking a short cab ride from the airport and im slap-bang in the middle of bangkok and just a few miles away from the sea even more incredibly scientists only discovered the giant freshwater stingray a mere years ago its species name chaophraya comes from this very river running through the heart of bangkok and yet this monster in our midst is still cloaked in mystery i want to find out how big it really gets i also want to know how far this animal travels inland in most peoples eyes stingrays are sea creatures not river fish barely an hours drive from the capital i track down a story that puts me on edge and reminds me that the venom of this creature has no known antidote four months ago local fisherman pun sang was surprised to hook one of these rarely-seen giants for people here such a huge fish is a potentially lucrative catch speaks thai the stingray came to the side of the river and then wouldnt come any further it basically got buried in the mud so what he had to do was get in the water which was about chest-deep and then completely go underwater with a rope feed the rope through the spiracles the water intake of the stingray knot the rope hed managed to pull it off the bottom it was actually as it rose in the water that he then felt this pain argh the wound was actually just numb to start with and then just this incredible pain in fact so painful that he collapsed from the intensity of the pain and had to crawl the remaining distance to the house this was not going to go away on its own it did need urgent medical treatment as he races for help pun sang continues to bleed heavily and almost passes out with the pain with no antidote available his chances of survival are anyones guess by the time he arrives for treatment his condition is deteriorating fast - what happens at the medical centre - speaks thai his heart rate spikes alarmingly despite anaesthetic he remains doubled up in agony the wound in fact is no more than a glancing blow and yet the pain proved so intense that pun sang is unable to work for the next four weeks he still has the very barb that impaled him can i have a look at that right well seeing that really does concentrate the mind an absolutely vicious point on that and these horrible barbs down the side and i think you know this is a fish ive got to really treat with some respect evidently even a quick jab from this fish can land you in serious trouble whatever it contains the venom seems every bit as potent as in marine stingrays ok so that actually went in about getting on for three inches there but it was at an oblique angle and so although he probably doesnt feel lucky to have had this experience if that had gone in straight and punctured the femoral artery that could have killed him tragically steve irwin the crocodile hunter was not so lucky he was struck clean through the heart and died while this freak accident happened way out at sea the chilling fact about the stingray im looking for is that it swims up rivers into some of the most densely populated parts of southeast asia and its in these crowded waterways that im about to try and meet this monster face-to-face i head to a town called samut songkhram miles west of bangkok and just a few miles inland this tidal stretch of river harbours some of the largest freshwater stingrays ever caught this fish the giant stingray was only described by scientists just years ago but presumably the people on these rivers have known about it probably for centuries the problem the scientists had was getting their hands on enough specimens to study what this means is either its a very rare animal or its just very very hard to get one out of the river to try and catch one of these elusive giants im teaming up with an experienced fishing crew led by stingray enthusiast boy live bait is essential its muscle movements will give off the electrical signals that stingrays use to detect their prey these animals are active hunters prowling over the riverbed in search of a meal their faces are packed with sophisticated sensors that penetrate the mud and murk potentially eight times my size this fish is in a different league from anything ive tackled before it calls for the heaviest gear im using ultra-strong braided line with yards of thick nylon monofilament at the business end to take some of the strain ill be wearing a harness good news for my arms but if the line digs in and jams i could be pulled in normally the fish cant take line and the line will break but when youre using a 160ib line that line isnt going to break im going to go over the side after pun sangs account im anxious to avoid this nightmare scenario if thats dug in for some reason ive got to have plan b im going to be strapped to that have a harness locked into that so ive got a knife if im going over the edge the knife comes out and just cut that line the fish can go its better than drowning with everything prepped we head for the chosen spot a deep pocket in the riverbed they call area because as they say round here its crawling with aliens my battle boat is rigged with four big-game rods including my own marlin-class outfit that ive brought for the occasion if a line goes im ready to hunker down strap in and lock horns to improve the odds boys put out a dozen or so extra lines tied to floats this isnt regarded as true sport fishing but my mission here isnt to beat my chest or win prizes i simply want to see one of these incredible animals in the flesh and within minutes theres something big mauling our baits it didnt run off with the bait but theres been a stingray on that something has come along and crushed that there but then instead of taking the bait its spat it out stingrays have crushing mouth parts that leave an unmistakable imprint disappointing in one sense but also good news im in the right place they are down there the next bites a clean take and we are game on as i race to clip in something powerful rips out several feet of line then decides to tow us upriver its spinning the boat its taking the boat down i think were going to need a bigger boat ok right ah oh yeah that is oh look at that rod that rod is now springing back slowly this line shouldnt go the rods a bit of an unknown quantity ah its my own marlin-class outfit taking the strain i just have visions of this rod suddenly shattering and getting a face full of fiberglass and carbon fiber thats pulling down thats pulling down there is quite a real possibility of this thing pulling me in i feel like im trying to pull the plug out of the river all i can do is dig in and keep the pressure on after exhausting minutes i havent gained an inch ah ah this isnt like any fishing ive ever experienced and i start to wonder if i can cope most fish its all over in five minutes half an hour at the extreme you know this in freshwater something like this is just its just unheard of with neither of us willing to give in it becomes a war of attrition give or take the odd foot of line were in total deadlock be careful ive just been told its one hour five minutes so far were into about round eight now oh look at that its taking line that is taking line fast this thing does not like being bullied i decided id show it whos boss and the fish is saying no no youre not the boss ah oh thats about half an hours worth of work has just gone ive just gained about 3ft of line and its just taken that but sometimes when it does that the fish then takes a bit of a breather and i can maybe capitalise for another minutes we slug it out in a gruelling tug of war right ive got the initiative whoa ah ah then after almost two hours a breakthrough i think its come off the bottom there was a sudden argh a sudden sort of break of suction it does feel like it is actually yeah thats definitely coming my way a lot faster than it has done at any time until now my arms are cramping up and im close to breaking point but ive finally got the measure of this gigantic fish its about a metre and a half below the surface here it comes im just seconds away from seeing what must surely be one of the worlds greatest river monsters oh right look at that the rod went the rod went i actually saw the fish we nearly nearly had it in the net but an almighty bang oh my gear was built to deal with sharks and marlin whatever broke this rod could have weighed as much as 700ibs i thought it was my shoulder going for a minute but it was the rod - too long - the rods too long yeah oh dear that was so close the fish nearly came in we saw it after two hours it was off the bottom we were trying to get the net round it the rod went and the fish escaped it wasnt quite in the net and to make matters worse the fight has left me with a torn bicep all that suffering i saw the fish and its oh all that for nothing all that oh its score one to the stingray but my close encounter with this giant has got me wondering why does this creature grow so huge as this photograph graphically shows marine stingrays are vulnerable to attack by sharks but what could possibly threaten a river stingray perhaps its no coincidence that the rivers here are also home to another gigantic fish growing up to nine feet long and weighing over 600ib the mekong giant catfish is a class a monster conceivably the stingrays immense size could be a defence strategy to get a close-up look at a giant mekong ive come to a stocked fishing lake these animals are all but extinct in the wild this is a strong fish got the line against the this ones giving me the run-around a huge tail a huge tail on that but its probably just a small one a very powerful sort of throbbing fight you can almost feel the beats of the tail thats a mekong catfish my catch is only one-tenth the size of what they can reach nonetheless i can see its no ordinary catfish being a catfish its got no scales but whats interesting as well although its a catfish it hasnt got feelers barbels and the other thing thats interesting here is theres no teeth in there theres not even anything approaching one of these raspy pads in there although this does grow very big and well over 600ib its not a predator this thing is a vegetarian its a gentle giant if im looking down from here i cant see any eyes the eyes are on the underside of the head very close to the corner of the mouth thats something that just points to it being a bottom feeder rooting around vegetable matter on the bottom so this gummy oddball isnt a killer which leaves me still wondering why the stingrays here have evolved into such giants ive yet to see a chaophraya stingray dead or alive but with thailands biggest fish market just down the road im back on the hunt this is a vast clearing house for everything that comes out of the sea for hundreds of miles around stingrays first evolved in the oceans and it could be that the giant freshwater stingray occurs in the sea as well as rivers so we have got rays here im finding some rays thats not the one im after this is an eagle ray of sorts yet another species of ray these are all marine species but this is bringing home there is a huge diversity of ray species lots of variations on the theme stingrays are clearly one of natures more successful designs but their origins some million years ago may come as a surprise a quick lesson in evolution here heres a shark that is the classic shark mouth the classic shark teeth the shark tail come to this fish here shark tail shark dorsal fin but something very different going on at the front end its flattening becoming squashed lets flip it over and suddenly weve got a very different type of mouth crushing plates but very different gills on the bottom of the body come to this fish here and here we have the same mouth the same gills flip it over there we have it a ray is basically a flattened shark with this long tail this flattened body plan with the eyes and water intakes on top is an adaptation for life on the ocean floor whatever its origins the monster im after continues to elude me after three hours of trawling i havent found a single specimen i head to the freshwater stalls where the fish are still pouring in if there are no giant stingrays coming out of the sea then perhaps ill find one here any chaophraya here speaks thai no so no stingray here i dont know how many thousands of fish i must have seen here thais really do love their fish they eat pretty well anything that swims but the freshwater ray is not here this could be because its rare it could be because its just hard to get out of the river maybe there is another reason i dont know of but i havent found one to learn more about this elusive monster im meeting a scientist who has more hands-on experience of this stingray than anyone in the world dr ning from chuialongkorn university in bangkok is one of the few people trying to study this animal our first task is to collect some water from the bottom of the river some feet down one thing i want to know is whether this ray is a true river fish living in pure fresh water thats on the bottom were only six or seven miles from the sea here so id expect the river to be quite salty in my mind this puts a question mark over claims that the giant stingray is a true freshwater fish now then this is the moment of truth if this were pure seawater the salt meter would give me a reading of with brackish water at around so that is right on zero which im quite surprised by its very obviously tidal here i had my doubts about whether this thing is a truly freshwater animal i think that is something that still requires a bit of unpacking perhaps but it is certainly capable of living in water that it is absolutely fresh theres no trace of seawater at this point at the moment in theory they could be even further up these rivers while im here i also want to find out more about the stingrays lair this stretch of water is less than half a mile from where i hooked the monster that broke my rod ugh look at that thats whats on the bottom here thick mud is going to give my quarry a big advantage they are going to get a very good seal and very good suction i now understand why i had such a battle to pull up this animal imagine thats the stingray that weighs nothing i can lift that easily and just getting a little bit under the mud there we go and i can lift it up look at that - argh - laughs so if that stingray gets the edges of its wings under the mud im not just lifting the stingray but the whole bottom of the river one of the things i want to find out about this fish is how heavy it gets for a small fish you put it in a bag and weigh it for something the size of these weve had to come up with something special back at area our lines are set and im hoping my lucks about to change as we wait for a bite boy tells me an unnerving story heart here made by heart go bump-bump-bump sweat - and thats the scar of it there - yeah just here ive just been asking boy about stingray wounds this kind of thing and he told me a story about how a small one just scratched him on the finger and he thought thats going to be fine minutes later the entire left side of his bodys gone numb the heart is pounding away he was thinking this could be like a snake bite this could be fatal after three hours it passed and im just thinking youve just got to be so careful when handling these things with plenty of floats out its not long before im back in the ring this time ive learnt my lesson and switched to a shorter rod its my arm that worries me im not sure itll take another rounds to my relief its barely minutes before this one starts to surface the fish is coming up the fish is coming up ok ok are you ready boys so weve got the fish here in the net ive finally caught one my first chaophraya stingray i keep well clear though until its sting is strapped up this fish is still a loaded gun so this is just binding the barb which sits in a bit of a groove that is binding the barb to the tail once its disarmed we head for the bank most of the body of the fish is in the water i havent really properly seen this fish im really looking forward now to getting it in and having a proper look at this animal the pink tinge on the belly makes me think of the rash that divers sometimes get when they come up from depth this fish has surfaced from feet down enough to give it a mild case of the bends so its vital we release it soon this species is said to top 1300ib yet as i now discover this is only half the story weve got a male this ones a male the entire team is on hand to help measure and weigh the fish so this ones about four and a half foot across its not particularly big as they go but it is very big for a male its sex explains why this one came up so fast astonishingly females can be up to eight times bigger than this full-grown male weve weighed it accurately which is quite a hard thing to do 175ib around 80kg for sheer weight this is one of the largest fish ive ever caught and yet incredible as it sounds its a mere min now its been out of the water long enough now definitely time to get it back in the water the males may be relatively small but theyre still armed with a potentially lethal sting before we turn him loose i go in for a closer look this is the business end this is why its called a stingray this sharp pointed poisonous barb on the tail end and it can throw this not only over its head like a scorpion it can throw it side to side so that is the weaponry seen up close a very impressive bit of weaponry it is too ok this is an animal that completely warps your normal sense of scale despite catching a good-sized male i know that my quest is far from over since it was first scientifically described there have been occasional reports of large chaophraya stingrays from far inland im leaving the tidal waterways around bangkok and heading up country could this be where ill finally find my monster i travel miles north following the chao phraya river upstream to a town called nakhon sawan but its late may and the rains are starting to break as i begin to fish the weather takes a turn for the worse rumble of thunder for three hours it pours without let-up all i catch is a dose of the monsoon blues rumble of thunder at least someones having some luck then i meet a man with an amazing tale this was what just here in nakhon sawan speaks thai this is interesting this is a recent capture only a few months ago im imagining that that wasnt easy to get out how long to get this out of the river speaks thai clearly a very big fish this apparently 320kg which converts to something like 700ibs a seriously large fish the story is it took people in two boats four hours to get it in and it actually dragged the boat well over a mile during that time so i think a bit of an epic battle and a big fish looking at the mans tackle im amazed he got it in at all ah weve got a video clip someone took obviously big local news theres people all around im no stranger to fishermens yarns but the figure of around 700ibs does ring true this fish was cut up and weighed accurately for market it seems they only kept one piece of it oh right - is this from the same fish - yeah same fish ooh right ok even with its tip broken off this barb is by far the biggest ive seen if there are giant stingrays here then how much further upriver do they go im starting to wonder could these creatures have penetrated deep into the river systems just like their distant amazon cousins getting on for miles long the mighty mekong is southeast asias greatest river until just the last years its upper reaches remained largely cut off from the outside world even today it still feels like a land of secrets if anyone can help me unlock them its the fishermen who make their living along its banks im now miles upriver and i wonder if anyone here will know about the creature im looking for i wonder if you fishing here see any chaophraya speaks thai the big-sized chaophraya or these were small fish any really big ones speaks thai what happened there was that the stingray got wrapped up in the net this big one just broke its way through it sounds promising but i want a positive id will they recognise the fish from nakhon sawan same fish speaks thai yeah speaks thai so the same fish as here man speaks thai right this is very interesting ive shown the picture of the ray that was caught at nakhon sawan not only is it the same species it was also about the same size this was a big animal here thats a very encouraging bit of information it does bode well im going to be putting a bait in water where these things are do the fishermen here try to catch chaophraya or is it always an accident do you is it a good fish to eat do people eat it men speak thai ah ok ok so the stingray will come after the small fish in the net its a nuisance species they try and get the fish that are in your net they get wrapped up themselves then youve got to take them out and be very careful of the sting if you get a big one theyre actually going to rip your net apart so they dont fish for them its a nuisance fish they call it i head further upriver into even more remote country but the mekong seems unwilling to give up its secrets am i looking in the wrong place i wonder or fishing in the wrong season my right arm still aches from the two-hour battle i fought and my exercise routine brings little relief just curious looks undeterred i travel back downriver with a confirmed eyewitness account im eager to take a look for myself im at a place called nong khai right on the border with laos years ago i was actually in this very same bit of river a little bit upstream and i was arrested by the police on suspicion of spying and that cut short my entire trip end of fishing end of everything they locked me up for the night and confiscated all my photos this time round im using sophisticated sonar equipment to scan the riverbed im looking down into the water ive got the sonar foot of water im trying to get a mental picture of the underwater geography as my first step in looking for the stingrays ive actually got fish symbols straightaway but theyre middle of the water unlikely to be stingrays although if there is something close to the bottom it could be a ray they dont spend all the time just stuck right down sometimes they do actually rise off maybe three or four feet and glide away im convinced there are giant stingrays down here but before i can unpack my rod theres a nasty surprise whoop of siren one problem about here its the border between thailand and laos i might have possibly strayed over the border im just going to carry on acting normal i suppose i have got some fairly hi-tech gear on the boat im spying on the bottom of the river whoop of siren ok ok go in ok ok they probably dont see that many foreigners on the river here ive been waved into the side ive been waved into the side they are still very very keen on keeping an eye on people who do things by this border the border area is just very sensitive thats another difficulty in trying to find this stingray here the political situation i avoid jail at least but ive no choice but to cut short my mission and head back south im starting to wonder if ill ever see this elusive monster with one last throw of the dice i return to area my hopes of actually seeing the monster ive come to find seem to be drifting away to catch this seemingly rare and almost legendary beast perhaps i need a little help from the gods im back at samut songkhram where ive already caught a full-grown male and come painfully close to landing a truly massive female just get the rods on first this time the stakes are even higher a team of scientists has arrived from chuialongkorn university in bangkok theyre counting on me to provide a live stingray for their research so little is known about this animal that every catch offers a rare chance to learn more the scientists will settle for any stingray i can catch but for me this is all about seeing a true giant to hell with my sore arm im just hoping weve hooked a big female i havent come this far to miss out i get the illusion now that im actually bringing the fish to me whats actually happening is im taking the boat to the fish the fish isnt actually going anywhere at the moment what do you think is it a fairly good fish oh its just actually come off the bottom its a worrying sign any monster worth its salt isnt going to give up so quickly but then the stingray sinks back down switches gear and takes off upriver oh the drag on this reei is a little bit like the handbrake on a car and ive got that almost fully on the fish is basically just taking that line as i watch at the moment its just going out one inch two inches three inches after half an hour my opponent stops for a breather and i do the same then were back for round two and its looking like a big fish seven of us on two boats are dragged half a mile - against the tide right it might surface it might surface over there now ive got the fish on the ropes for the first time it feels like im driving the bus under the boat i dont want to be lifting it while its under the boat i think its coming this way again its just squashing my fingers its gone this way see the water there i havent seen the fish yet it is near the surface ive just seen the lead its up in the water i think weve got it back of the net and this one looks pretty big with an impressive 10-inch sting head of the science team dr ning first secures the barb speaks thai shes asked me to help her collect some venom before we release the fish it takes six people to heave this huge animal onto its front into a position where we can measure it 180cm to the base of the tail going for the wingspan metres nearly two metres across at around six feet across and roughly 400ibs this female stingray is by far the largest river fish ive ever seen little did i realise she was about to produce the mother of all surprises so weve just got the fish in to where the scientific team is and literally as we sort of pulled it into the net its actually given birth to two live young dr ning uses ultrasound to see if there are any more babies still inside this is the first time scientists have been able to collect data from the fully-formed pups of these stingrays here here on the ultrasound the dark line is the cavity and there is a lighter shape inside it apparently that is the baby stingray still inside for me this fish is a real first and not just for its size i thought i had one fish on the end it looks like ive got one two three and another one inside four fish one hook like many sharks stingrays give birth to live young when they emerged these babies had what looked like a small cap on their stings presumably to prevent internal injury to the mother however these safety catches soon drop off within minutes these twins are armed and ready to defend themselves it has been known for these fish to eject young when they are caught and if they are not well developed theres a worry they wont survive the great thing about these two fish is they are pretty well fully developed they might be being born a little bit early but i think they will survive in this river with that two-inch prong on their tails not a lot will come near them the scientists return to what i can only describe as the mother ship no-one really knows why this animal grows so huge could size i wonder be the key that allows a marine fish to invade rivers most sea fish die quickly in freshwater its the larger ones that are best able to cope with the stress and survive theres one final sample to extract ok - be careful - we are now going to take the toxin ok ill hold here collecting this thick toxic mucus will help the scientists to discover in more detail how the venom works its time for me to bid farewell to this river monster though the jurys still out if further research confirms that this fish does live exclusively in freshwater then it probably is the biggest freshwater fish on the planet whats certain is that this is the biggest and strangest catch of my life reunited with her babies the mother stingray is set free and she returns to the dark depths of her hidden world i think shell probably go back to all her friends with stories of alien abduction they did experiments on me and all sorts personally i feel like im the one who has seen the alien i mean just what an amazing totally un-fish-like fish i mean a real monstrous beast,the giant freshwater stingray urogymnus polylepis also widely known by the junior synonym himantura chaophraya is a species of stingray in the family dasyatidae it is found in large rivers and estuaries in southeast asia and borneo though historically it may have been more widely distributed in south and southeast asia the widest freshwater fish and the largest stingray in the world this species grows up to m ft across and can exceed kg lb in weight it has a relatively thin oval pectoral fin disc that is widest anteriorly and a sharply pointed snout with a protruding tip its tail is thin and whip-like and lacks fin folds this species is uniformly grayish brown above and white below the underside of the pectoral and pelvic fins bear distinctive wide dark bands on their posterior margins bottom-dwelling in nature the giant freshwater stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates females give live birth to litters of one to four pups which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph uterine milk this species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat recreation and aquarium display as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation these forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central thailand and cambodia as a result the international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed the giant freshwater stingray as endangered taxonomy and phylogeny the first scientific description of the giant freshwater stingray was authored by dutch ichthyologist pieter bleeker in an volume of the journal verhandelingen van het bataviaasch genootschap van kunsten en wetenschappen his account was based on a juvenile specimen cm in across collected from jakarta indonesia bleeker named the new species polylepis from the greek poly many and lepis scales and assigned it to the genus trygon now a synonym of dasyatis however in subsequent years bleekers description was largely overlooked and in the giant freshwater stingray was described again by supap monkolprasit and tyson roberts in an issue of the japanese journal of ichthyology they gave it the name himantura chaophraya which came into widespread usage in peter last and b mabel manjaji-matsumoto confirmed that t polylepis and h chaophraya refer to the same species and since bleekers name was published earlier the scientific name of the giant freshwater stingray became himantura polylepis this species may also be called the giant freshwater whipray giant stingray or freshwater whipray there is a complex of similar freshwater and estuarine stingrays in south asia southeast asia and australasia that are or were tentatively identified with u polylepis the australian freshwater urogymnus were described as a separate species urogymnus dalyensis in the freshwater urogymnus in new guinea are probably u dalyensis rather than u polylepis though confirmation awaits further study trygon fluviatilis from india as described by nelson annandale in closely resembles and may be conspecific with u polylepis on the other hand comparison of freshwater whipray dna and amino acid sequences between india and thailand has revealed significant differences finally additional research is needed to assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of u polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted in terms of the broader evolutionary relationships between the giant freshwater whipray and the rest of the family dasyatidae a phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial dna reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray urogymnus asperrimus and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray u granulatus and the tubemouth whipray u lobistoma this finding adds to a growing consensus that the genus himantura sensu lato is paraphyletic description the giant freshwater stingray has a thin oval pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front the elongated snout has a wide base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc the eyes are minute and widely spaced behind them are large spiracles between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin the small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae two to four large at the center and one to four small to the sides on the floor the small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands there are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc the pelvic fins are small and thin mature males have relatively large claspers the thin cylindrical tail measures times as long as the disc and lacks fin folds a single serrated stinging spine is positioned on the upper surface of the tail near the base at up to cm in long the spine is the largest of any stingray species there is band of heart-shaped tubercles on the upper surface of the disc extending from before the eyes to the base of the sting there is also a midline row of four to six enlarged tubercles at the center of the disc the remainder of the disc upper surface is covered by tiny granular denticles and the tail is covered with sharp prickles past the sting this species is plain grayish brown above often with a yellowish or pinkish tint towards the fin margins in life the skin is coated with a layer of dark brown mucus the underside is white with broad dark bands edged with small spots on the trailing margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins the tail is black behind the spine the giant freshwater stingray reaches at least m ft in width and m ft in length and can likely grow larger it is not impossible that length is even m ft and width is m ft with reports from the mekong and chao phraya rivers of individuals weighing kg lb but it is not impossible that it is kg lb or even kg lb - it ranks among the largest freshwater fishes in the world in june it was reported that a specimen caught in the mekong river had broken the record for the largest strict freshwater fish ever documented the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size but they are anadromous the individual weighed lb kg and was measured at m ft long and m ft wide distribution and habitat the giant freshwater stingray is known to inhabit several large rivers and associated estuaries in indochina and borneo in indochina it occurs in the mekong river to potentially as far upstream as chiang khong in thailand as well as in the chao phraya nan mae klong bang pakong and tapi rivers also found in bueng boraphet but now completely extinct in borneo this species is found in the mahakam river in kalimantan and the kinabatangan and buket rivers in sabah it is reportedly common in the kinabatangan river but infrequently caught though it has been reported from sarawak as well surveys within the past years have not found it there elsewhere in the region recent river surveys in java have not recorded its presence despite the island being the locality of the species holotype historical records from the ganges river in india and the bay of bengal as trygon fluviatilis are possibly himantura fluviatilis although it has been confirmed as being present in the kaladan and mayu rivers in myanmar in disjunct populations of the giant freshwater stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another though the species occurs in brackish environments there is no evidence that it crosses marine waters this is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat unexpectedly it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas biology and ecology the diet of the giant freshwater stingray consists of small benthic fishes and invertebrates such as crustaceans and molluscs which it can detect using its electroreceptive ampullae of lorenzini individuals can often be seen at the edge of the river possibly feeding on earthworms parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms acanthobothrium asnihae a etini a masnihae a saliki a zainali rhinebothrium abaiensis r kinabatanganensis and r megacanthophallus the giant freshwater stingray is viviparous with the developing embryos nourished initially by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk provided by the mother this species does not appear to be diadromous migrating between fresh and salt water to complete its life cycle observed litter sizes range from one to four pups newborns measure around cm in across pregnant females are frequently found in estuaries which may serve as nursery areas males mature sexually at approximately m ft across female maturation size and other life history details are unknown human interactions the giant freshwater stingray is not aggressive but its sting is sheathed in toxic mucus and is capable of piercing bone across its range this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines and to a lesser extent gillnets and fish traps it is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud becoming almost impossible to lift or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater the meat and the cartilage are used large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless in the mae klong and bang pakong rivers the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums these trends pose conservation concerns the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown the latter because this species does not survive well in captivity the major threats to the giant freshwater stingray are overfishing and habitat degradation resulting from deforestation land development and damming the construction of dams also fragments the population reducing genetic diversity and increasing the susceptibility of the resulting subpopulations to extinction due to its low reproductive rate the giant freshwater stingray is not resilient to anthropogenic pressures in central thailand and cambodia the population is estimated to have been reduced by over the past years with declines as severe as in some locations the size of rays caught has decreased significantly as well for example in cambodia the average weight of a landed ray has dropped from kg lb in to kg lb in the status of populations in other areas such as borneo is largely unknown as a result of documented declines the international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as endangered overall and as critically endangered in thailand in the 1990s the thai government initiated a captive breeding program at chai nat to bolster the population of this and other freshwater stingray species until the issue of habitat degradation can be remedied however by the program had been put on hold references classification names common names synonyms catalog of fishes genus species itis col worms cloffa

the suburbs of berlin ive been busy tracking down the worlds most frightening freshwater fish and uncovering the truth about their evil reputations its taking line thats taking line ive tangled with man-eating catfish this is the one that goes after people as well swum with piranhas and grappled with ferocious gar agh my next assignment is a beast of terrifying power its spinning the boat its taking the boat down some people say this is the worlds biggest freshwater fish if my line jams it could pull me in this is a monster that can stab you with an eight-inch bayonet its flesh-dissolving venom has no known antidote just catching this fish will test me to the limit but my aim isnt simply to measure one of these giants i also want to know where*****************lives and how dangerous it really is - ive a feeling this could be - agh - my toughest challenge yet - here it comes here it comes i think were going to need a bigger boat in just the past few years a strange and possibly deadly creature has come out of the shadows ive read dramatic accounts of epic six-hour battles and heard that this predator can inflict horrendous wounds some people are even claiming that this little-known beast is the worlds biggest freshwater fish the name of this monster is himantura chaophraya the giant freshwater stingray shaped like a ufo this southeast asian giant is said to grow to 16ft long and 7ft across some sources*****************its weight at over 1300ibs even this basic information is very hard to verify it all sounds incredibly impressive but how much of this stuff can i really believe it seems that no-one knows how big this thing actually grows or why ive encountered river stingrays before a thousand miles up the amazon here theyre known as wish you were dead fish because of their agonisingly painful sting but these stingrays are relatively small the thought of a 16-footer sends a real shiver down my spine these are some examples of the wounds caused by marine stingrays typically what youre talking about is a very deep puncture wound normally to the foot or the lower leg but sometimes higher*****************exactly the same thing on a bayonet or a combat knife and the third thing looking closely at this you see these serrations along the edge here and it works on the same principle as an arrowhead it goes in very cleanly but you know its going to make a real mess when you pull it out imagine being stabbed by a large steak knife only this ones smeared with poison and it really shreds your flesh when it comes out yep ive heard that the giant freshwater stingray has a barb that is eight inches long which is a really sobering thought im quite curious to have a look at one of those hopefully not too close its not something i want to bring back as a souvenir in my leg my quest for the giant freshwater stingray takes me to southeast asia first to thailands capital bangkok surprisingly*****************huge and potentially lethal monster lives right under our noses normally when looking for underwater monsters youre thinking hundreds of miles upriver in remote wilderness but not this time im literally taking a short cab ride from the airport and im slap-bang in the middle of bangkok and just a few miles away from the sea even more incredibly scientists only discovered the giant freshwater stingray a mere years ago its species name chaophraya comes from this very river running through the heart of bangkok and yet this monster in our midst is still cloaked in mystery i want to find out how big it really gets i also want to know how far this animal travels inland in*****************peoples eyes stingrays are sea creatures not river fish barely an hours drive from the capital i track down a story that puts me on edge and reminds me that the venom of this creature has no known antidote four months ago local fisherman pun sang was surprised to hook one of these rarely-seen giants for people here such a huge fish is a potentially lucrative catch speaks thai the stingray came to the side of the river and then wouldnt come any further it basically got buried in the mud so what he had to do was get in the water which was about chest-deep and then completely go underwater with a rope feed the rope through the*****************races for help pun sang continues to bleed heavily and almost passes out with the pain with no antidote available his chances of survival are anyones guess by the time he arrives for treatment his condition is deteriorating fast - what happens at the medical centre - speaks thai his heart rate spikes alarmingly despite anaesthetic he remains doubled up in agony the wound in fact is no more than a glancing blow and yet the pain proved so intense that pun sang is unable to work for the next four weeks he still has the very barb that impaled him can i have a look at that right well seeing that really does concentrate the mind an absolutely vicious point on that and these horrible barbs down the side and i think you know this is a fish ive got to really treat with some respect evidently even a*****************jab from this fish can land you in serious trouble whatever it contains the venom seems every bit as potent as in marine stingrays ok so that actually went in about getting on for three inches there but it was at an oblique angle and so although he probably doesnt feel lucky to have had this experience if that had gone in straight and punctured the femoral artery that could have killed him tragically steve irwin the crocodile hunter was not so lucky he was struck clean through the heart and died while this freak accident happened way out at sea the chilling fact about the stingray im looking for is that it swims up rivers into some of*****************most densely populated parts of southeast asia and its in these crowded waterways that im about to try and meet this monster face-to-face i head to a town called samut songkhram miles west of bangkok and just a few miles inland this tidal stretch of river harbours some of the largest freshwater stingrays ever caught this fish the giant stingray was only described by scientists just years ago but presumably the people on these rivers have known about it probably for centuries the problem the scientists had was getting their hands on enough specimens to study what this means is either its a very rare animal or its just very very hard to get one out of the river*****************try and catch one of these elusive giants im teaming up with an experienced fishing crew led by stingray enthusiast boy live bait is essential its muscle movements will give off the electrical signals that stingrays use to detect their prey these animals are active hunters prowling over the riverbed in search of a meal their faces are packed with sophisticated sensors that penetrate the mud and murk potentially eight times my size this fish is in a different league from anything ive tackled before it calls for the heaviest gear im using ultra-strong braided line with yards of thick nylon monofilament at the business end to take some of the strain ill be wearing a harness good news*****************my arms but if the line digs in and jams i could be pulled in normally the fish cant take line and the line will break but when youre using a 160ib line that line isnt going to break im going to go over the side after pun sangs account im anxious to avoid this nightmare scenario if thats dug in for some reason ive got to have plan b im going to be strapped to that have a harness locked into that so ive got a knife if im going over the edge the knife comes out and just cut that line the fish can go its better than drowning with everything prepped we head for the chosen*****************a deep pocket in the riverbed they call area because as they say round here its crawling with aliens my battle boat is rigged with four big-game rods including my own marlin-class outfit that ive brought for the occasion if a line goes im ready to hunker down strap in and lock horns to improve the odds boys put out a dozen or so extra lines tied to floats this isnt regarded as true sport fishing but my mission here isnt to beat my chest or win prizes i simply want to see one of these incredible animals in the flesh and within minutes theres something big mauling our baits it didnt run off with the bait but theres*****************down i think were going to need a bigger boat ok right ah oh yeah that is oh look at that rod that rod is now springing back slowly this line shouldnt go the rods a bit of an unknown quantity ah its my own marlin-class outfit taking the strain i just have visions of this rod suddenly shattering and getting a face full of fiberglass and carbon fiber thats pulling down thats pulling down there is quite a real possibility of this thing pulling me in i feel like im trying to pull the plug out of the river all i can do is dig in and keep the pressure on after exhausting minutes i havent gained an inch ah ah this isnt like any fishing ive ever experienced and i start to wonder if i can cope most fish its all over in five minutes half an hour*****************the extreme you know this in freshwater something like this is just its just unheard of with neither of us willing to give in it becomes a war of attrition give or take the odd foot of line were in total deadlock be careful ive just been told its one hour five minutes so far were into about round eight now oh look at that its taking line that is taking line fast this thing does not like being bullied i decided id show it whos boss and the fish is saying no no youre not the boss ah oh thats about half an hours worth of work has just gone ive just gained about 3ft of line and*****************just taken that but sometimes when it does that the fish then takes a bit of a breather and i can maybe capitalise for another minutes we slug it out in a gruelling tug of war right ive got the initiative whoa ah ah then after almost two hours a breakthrough i think its come off the bottom there was a sudden argh a sudden sort of break of suction it does feel like it is actually yeah thats definitely coming my way a lot faster than it has done at any time until now my arms are cramping up and im close to breaking point but ive finally got the measure of this gigantic fish its about a*****************and a half below the surface here it comes im just seconds away from seeing what must surely be one of the worlds greatest river monsters oh right look at that the rod went the rod went i actually saw the fish we nearly nearly had it in the net but an almighty bang oh my gear was built to deal with sharks and marlin whatever broke this rod could have weighed as much as 700ibs i thought it was my shoulder going for a minute but it was the rod - too long - the rods too long yeah oh dear that was so close the fish nearly came in we saw it after two hours it was*****************the bottom we were trying to get the net round it the rod went and the fish escaped it wasnt quite in the net and to make matters worse the fight has left me with a torn bicep all that suffering i saw the fish and its oh all that for nothing all that oh its score one to the stingray but my close encounter with this giant has got me wondering why does this creature grow so huge as this photograph graphically shows marine stingrays are vulnerable to attack by sharks but what could possibly threaten a river stingray perhaps its no coincidence that the rivers here are also home to another gigantic fish growing up to nine*****************long and weighing over 600ib the mekong giant catfish is a class a monster conceivably the stingrays immense size could be a defence strategy to get a close-up look at a giant mekong ive come to a stocked fishing lake these animals are all but extinct in the wild this is a strong fish got the line against the this ones giving me the run-around a huge tail a huge tail on that but its probably just a small one a very powerful sort of throbbing fight you can almost feel the beats of the tail thats a mekong catfish my catch is only one-tenth the size of what they can reach nonetheless i can see its no ordinary*****************being a catfish its got no scales but whats interesting as well although its a catfish it hasnt got feelers barbels and the other thing thats interesting here is theres no teeth in there theres not even anything approaching one of these raspy pads in there although this does grow very big and well over 600ib its not a predator this thing is a vegetarian its a gentle giant if im looking down from here i cant see any eyes the eyes are on the underside of the head very close to the corner of the mouth thats something that just points to it being a bottom feeder rooting around vegetable matter on the bottom so this gummy oddball*****************a killer which leaves me still wondering why the stingrays here have evolved into such giants ive yet to see a chaophraya stingray dead or alive but with thailands biggest fish market just down the road im back on the hunt this is a vast clearing house for everything that comes out of the sea for hundreds of miles around stingrays first evolved in the oceans and it could be that the giant freshwater stingray occurs in the sea as well as rivers so we have got rays here im finding some rays thats not the one im after this is an eagle ray of sorts yet another species of ray these are all marine species but this is*****************home there is a huge diversity of ray species lots of variations on the theme stingrays are clearly one of natures more successful designs but their origins some million years ago may come as a surprise a quick lesson in evolution here heres a shark that is the classic shark mouth the classic shark teeth the shark tail come to this fish here shark tail shark dorsal fin but something very different going on at the front end its flattening becoming squashed lets flip it over and suddenly weve got a very different type of mouth crushing plates but very different gills on the bottom of the body come to this fish here and here we have the same*****************the same gills flip it over there we have it a ray is basically a flattened shark with this long tail this flattened body plan with the eyes and water intakes on top is an adaptation for life on the ocean floor whatever its origins the monster im after continues to elude me after three hours of trawling i havent found a single specimen i head to the freshwater stalls where the fish are still pouring in if there are no giant stingrays coming out of the sea then perhaps ill find one here any chaophraya here speaks thai no so no stingray here i dont know how many thousands of fish i must have seen here thais really*****************love their fish they eat pretty well anything that swims but the freshwater ray is not here this could be because its rare it could be because its just hard to get out of the river maybe there is another reason i dont know of but i havent found one to learn more about this elusive monster im meeting a scientist who has more hands-on experience of this stingray than anyone in the world dr ning from chuialongkorn university in bangkok is one of the few people trying to study this animal our first task is to collect some water from the bottom of the river some feet down one thing i want to know is whether this ray*****************a true river fish living in pure fresh water thats on the bottom were only six or seven miles from the sea here so id expect the river to be quite salty in my mind this puts a question mark over claims that the giant stingray is a true freshwater fish now then this is the moment of truth if this were pure seawater the salt meter would give me a reading of with brackish water at around so that is right on zero which im quite surprised by its very obviously tidal here i had my doubts about whether this thing is a truly freshwater animal i think that is something that still requires a bit of unpacking*****************but it is certainly capable of living in water that it is absolutely fresh theres no trace of seawater at this point at the moment in theory they could be even further up these rivers while im here i also want to find out more about the stingrays lair this stretch of water is less than half a mile from where i hooked the monster that broke my rod ugh look at that thats whats on the bottom here thick mud is going to give my quarry a big advantage they are going to get a very good seal and very good suction i now understand why i had such a battle to pull up this animal imagine thats*****************stingray that weighs nothing i can lift that easily and just getting a little bit under the mud there we go and i can lift it up look at that - argh - laughs so if that stingray gets the edges of its wings under the mud im not just lifting the stingray but the whole bottom of the river one of the things i want to find out about this fish is how heavy it gets for a small fish you put it in a bag and weigh it for something the size of these weve had to come up with something special back at area our lines are set and im hoping my lucks about to change*****************be like a snake bite this could be fatal after three hours it passed and im just thinking youve just got to be so careful when handling these things with plenty of floats out its not long before im back in the ring this time ive learnt my lesson and switched to a shorter rod its my arm that worries me im not sure itll take another rounds to my relief its barely minutes before this one starts to surface the fish is coming up the fish is coming up ok ok are you ready boys so weve got the fish here in the net ive finally caught one my first chaophraya stingray i keep well clear though until its sting is strapped up this fish is still a loaded gun so this is just binding the barb which sits in a bit of a groove that is binding the*****************to the tail once its disarmed we head for the bank most of the body of the fish is in the water i havent really properly seen this fish im really looking forward now to getting it in and having a proper look at this animal the pink tinge on the belly makes me think of the rash that divers sometimes get when they come up from depth this fish has surfaced from feet down enough to give it a mild case of the bends so its vital we release it soon this species is said to top 1300ib yet as i now discover this is only half the story weve got a male this ones a male the*****************team is on hand to help measure and weigh the fish so this ones about four and a half foot across its not particularly big as they go but it is very big for a male its sex explains why this one came up so fast astonishingly females can be up to eight times bigger than this full-grown male weve weighed it accurately which is quite a hard thing to do 175ib around 80kg for sheer weight this is one of the largest fish ive ever caught and yet incredible as it sounds its a mere min now its been out of the water long enough now definitely time to get it back in the water the males may*****************relatively small but theyre still armed with a potentially lethal sting before we turn him loose i go in for a closer look this is the business end this is why its called a stingray this sharp pointed poisonous barb on the tail end and it can throw this not only over its head like a scorpion it can throw it side to side so that is the weaponry seen up close a very impressive bit of weaponry it is too ok this is an animal that completely warps your normal sense of scale despite catching a good-sized male i know that my quest is far from over since it was first scientifically described there have been occasional reports*****************large chaophraya stingrays from far inland im leaving the tidal waterways around bangkok and heading up country could this be where ill finally find my monster i travel miles north following the chao phraya river upstream to a town called nakhon sawan but its late may and the rains are starting to break as i begin to fish the weather takes a turn for the worse rumble of thunder for three hours it pours without let-up all i catch is a dose of the monsoon blues rumble of thunder at least someones having some luck then i meet a man with an amazing tale this was what just here in nakhon sawan speaks thai this is interesting this is*****************recent capture only a few months ago im imagining that that wasnt easy to get out how long to get this out of the river speaks thai clearly a very big fish this apparently 320kg which converts to something like 700ibs a seriously large fish the story is it took people in two boats four hours to get it in and it actually dragged the boat well over a mile during that time so i think a bit of an epic battle and a big fish looking at the mans tackle im amazed he got it in at all ah weve got a video clip someone took obviously big local news theres people all around im no stranger to*****************yarns but the figure of around 700ibs does ring true this fish was cut up and weighed accurately for market it seems they only kept one piece of it oh right - is this from the same fish - yeah same fish ooh right ok even with its tip broken off this barb is by far the biggest ive seen if there are giant stingrays here then how much further upriver do they go im starting to wonder could these creatures have penetrated deep into the river systems just like their distant amazon cousins getting on for miles long the mighty mekong is southeast asias greatest river until just the last years its upper reaches remained largely cut off*****************the outside world even today it still feels like a land of secrets if anyone can help me unlock them its the fishermen who make their living along its banks im now miles upriver and i wonder if anyone here will know about the creature im looking for i wonder if you fishing here see any chaophraya speaks thai the big-sized chaophraya or these were small fish any really big ones speaks thai what happened there was that the stingray got wrapped up in the net this big one just broke its way through it sounds promising but i want a positive id will they recognise the fish from nakhon sawan same fish speaks thai yeah speaks thai so*****************same fish as here man speaks thai right this is very interesting ive shown the picture of the ray that was caught at nakhon sawan not only is it the same species it was also about the same size this was a big animal here thats a very encouraging bit of information it does bode well im going to be putting a bait in water where these things are do the fishermen here try to catch chaophraya or is it always an accident do you is it a good fish to eat do people eat it men speak thai ah ok ok so the stingray will come after the small fish in the net its a nuisance species they*****************and get the fish that are in your net they get wrapped up themselves then youve got to take them out and be very careful of the sting if you get a big one theyre actually going to rip your net apart so they dont fish for them its a nuisance fish they call it i head further upriver into even more remote country but the mekong seems unwilling to give up its secrets am i looking in the wrong place i wonder or fishing in the wrong season my right arm still aches from the two-hour battle i fought and my exercise routine brings little relief just curious looks undeterred i travel back downriver with a confirmed eyewitness*****************im eager to take a look for myself im at a place called nong khai right on the border with laos years ago i was actually in this very same bit of river a little bit upstream and i was arrested by the police on suspicion of spying and that cut short my entire trip end of fishing end of everything they locked me up for the night and confiscated all my photos this time round im using sophisticated sonar equipment to scan the riverbed im looking down into the water ive got the sonar foot of water im trying to get a mental picture of the underwater geography as my first step in looking for the stingrays ive*****************got fish symbols straightaway but theyre middle of the water unlikely to be stingrays although if there is something close to the bottom it could be a ray they dont spend all the time just stuck right down sometimes they do actually rise off maybe three or four feet and glide away im convinced there are giant stingrays down here but before i can unpack my rod theres a nasty surprise whoop of siren one problem about here its the border between thailand and laos i might have possibly strayed over the border im just going to carry on acting normal i suppose i have got some fairly hi-tech gear on the boat im spying on the bottom of*****************south im starting to wonder if ill ever see this elusive monster with one last throw of the dice i return to area my hopes of actually seeing the monster ive come to find seem to be drifting away to catch this seemingly rare and almost legendary beast perhaps i need a little help from the gods im back at samut songkhram where ive already caught a full-grown male and come painfully close to landing a truly massive female just get the rods on first this time the stakes are even higher a team of scientists has arrived from chuialongkorn university in bangkok theyre counting on me to provide a live stingray for their research so little is known about this animal that every catch offers a rare chance to learn more the scientists will settle for any stingray i can catch but for me this is all about seeing*****************true giant to hell with my sore arm im just hoping weve hooked a big female i havent come this far to miss out i get the illusion now that im actually bringing the fish to me whats actually happening is im taking the boat to the fish the fish isnt actually going anywhere at the moment what do you think is it a fairly good fish oh its just actually come off the bottom its a worrying sign any monster worth its salt isnt going to give up so quickly but then the stingray sinks back down switches gear and takes off upriver oh the drag on this reei is a little bit like the handbrake on a*****************and ive got that almost fully on the fish is basically just taking that line as i watch at the moment its just going out one inch two inches three inches after half an hour my opponent stops for a breather and i do the same then were back for round two and its looking like a big fish seven of us on two boats are dragged half a mile - against the tide right it might surface it might surface over there now ive got the fish on the ropes for the first time it feels like im driving the bus under the boat i dont want to be lifting it while its under the boat i think*****************coming this way again its just squashing my fingers its gone this way see the water there i havent seen the fish yet it is near the surface ive just seen the lead its up in the water i think weve got it back of the net and this one looks pretty big with an impressive 10-inch sting head of the science team dr ning first secures the barb speaks thai shes asked me to help her collect some venom before we release the fish it takes six people to heave this huge animal onto its front into a position where we can measure it 180cm to the base of the tail going for the wingspan metres nearly two*****************across at around six feet across and roughly 400ibs this female stingray is by far the largest river fish ive ever seen little did i realise she was about to produce the mother of all surprises so weve just got the fish in to where the scientific team is and literally as we sort of pulled it into the net its actually given birth to two live young dr ning uses ultrasound to see if there are any more babies still inside this is the first time scientists have been able to collect data from the fully-formed pups of these stingrays here here on the ultrasound the dark line is the cavity and there is a lighter shape inside*****************apparently that is the baby stingray still inside for me this fish is a real first and not just for its size i thought i had one fish on the end it looks like ive got one two three and another one inside four fish one hook like many sharks stingrays give birth to live young when they emerged these babies had what looked like a small cap on their stings presumably to prevent internal injury to the mother however these safety catches soon drop off within minutes these twins are armed and ready to defend themselves it has been known for these fish to eject young when they are caught and if they are not well developed theres*****************worry they wont survive the great thing about these two fish is they are pretty well fully developed they might be being born a little bit early but i think they will survive in this river with that two-inch prong on their tails not a lot will come near them the scientists return to what i can only describe as the mother ship no-one really knows why this animal grows so huge could size i wonder be the key that allows a marine fish to invade rivers most sea fish die quickly in freshwater its the larger ones that are best able to cope with the stress and survive theres one final sample to extract ok - be careful*****************we are now going to take the toxin ok ill hold here collecting this thick toxic mucus will help the scientists to discover in more detail how the venom works its time for me to bid farewell to this river monster though the jurys still out if further research confirms that this fish does live exclusively in freshwater then it probably is the biggest freshwater fish on the planet whats certain is that this is the biggest and strangest catch of my life reunited with her babies the mother stingray is set free and she returns to the dark depths of her hidden world i think shell probably go back to all her friends with stories of alien abduction*****************did experiments on me and all sorts personally i feel like im the one who has seen the alien i mean just what an amazing totally un-fish-like fish i mean a real monstrous beast,the giant freshwater stingray urogymnus polylepis also widely known by the junior synonym himantura chaophraya is a species of stingray in the family dasyatidae it is found in large rivers and estuaries in southeast asia and borneo though historically it may have been more widely distributed in south and southeast asia the widest freshwater fish and the largest stingray in the world this species grows up to m ft across and can exceed kg lb in weight it has a relatively thin oval pectoral fin disc that is widest anteriorly and a sharply pointed snout with a protruding tip its tail is thin and whip-like and lacks fin folds this species is uniformly grayish brown above and white below the underside of the pectoral and pelvic fins bear distinctive wide dark bands on their posterior margins bottom-dwelling in nature the giant freshwater stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys*****************small fishes and invertebrates females give live birth to litters of one to four pups which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph uterine milk this species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat recreation and aquarium display as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation these forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central thailand and cambodia as a result the international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed the giant freshwater stingray as endangered taxonomy and phylogeny the first scientific description of the giant freshwater stingray was authored by dutch ichthyologist pieter bleeker in an volume of the journal verhandelingen van het bataviaasch genootschap van kunsten en wetenschappen his account was based on*****************juvenile specimen cm in across collected from jakarta indonesia bleeker named the new species polylepis from the greek poly many and lepis scales and assigned it to the genus trygon now a synonym of dasyatis however in subsequent years bleekers description was largely overlooked and in the giant freshwater stingray was described again by supap monkolprasit and tyson roberts in an issue of the japanese journal of ichthyology they gave it the name himantura chaophraya which came into widespread usage in peter last and b mabel manjaji-matsumoto confirmed that t polylepis and h chaophraya refer to the same species and since bleekers name was published earlier the scientific name of the giant freshwater stingray became himantura polylepis this species*****************also be called the giant freshwater whipray giant stingray or freshwater whipray there is a complex of similar freshwater and estuarine stingrays in south asia southeast asia and australasia that are or were tentatively identified with u polylepis the australian freshwater urogymnus were described as a separate species urogymnus dalyensis in the freshwater urogymnus in new guinea are probably u dalyensis rather than u polylepis though confirmation awaits further study trygon fluviatilis from india as described by nelson annandale in closely resembles and may be conspecific with u polylepis on the other hand comparison of freshwater whipray dna and amino acid sequences between india and thailand has revealed significant differences finally additional research is needed to assess the degree*****************divergence amongst populations of u polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted in terms of the broader evolutionary relationships between the giant freshwater whipray and the rest of the family dasyatidae a phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial dna reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray urogymnus asperrimus and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray u granulatus and the tubemouth whipray u lobistoma this finding adds to a growing consensus that the genus himantura sensu lato is paraphyletic description the giant freshwater stingray has a thin oval pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front the*****************snout has a wide base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc the eyes are minute and widely spaced behind them are large spiracles between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin the small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae two to four large at the center and one to four small to the sides on the floor the small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands there are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc the pelvic fins are small and thin mature males have relatively large claspers the thin cylindrical tail measures times as long as*****************tiny granular denticles and the tail is covered with sharp prickles past the sting this species is plain grayish brown above often with a yellowish or pinkish tint towards the fin margins in life the skin is coated with a layer of dark brown mucus the underside is white with broad dark bands edged with small spots on the trailing margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins the tail is black behind the spine the giant freshwater stingray reaches at least m ft in width and m ft in length and can likely grow larger it is not impossible that length is even m ft and width is m ft with reports from the mekong and chao phraya rivers of individuals weighing kg lb but it is not impossible that it is kg lb or even kg lb - it ranks among the largest freshwater fishes in the world in*****************it was reported that a specimen caught in the mekong river had broken the record for the largest strict freshwater fish ever documented the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size but they are anadromous the individual weighed lb kg and was measured at m ft long and m ft wide distribution and habitat the giant freshwater stingray is known to inhabit several large rivers and associated estuaries in indochina and borneo in indochina it occurs in the mekong river to potentially as far upstream as chiang khong in thailand as well as in the chao phraya nan mae klong bang pakong and tapi rivers also found in bueng boraphet but now completely extinct in borneo this species*****************found in the mahakam river in kalimantan and the kinabatangan and buket rivers in sabah it is reportedly common in the kinabatangan river but infrequently caught though it has been reported from sarawak as well surveys within the past years have not found it there elsewhere in the region recent river surveys in java have not recorded its presence despite the island being the locality of the species holotype historical records from the ganges river in india and the bay of bengal as trygon fluviatilis are possibly himantura fluviatilis although it has been confirmed as being present in the kaladan and mayu rivers in myanmar in disjunct populations of the giant freshwater stingray in separate river drainages are probably*****************from one another though the species occurs in brackish environments there is no evidence that it crosses marine waters this is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat unexpectedly it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas biology and ecology the diet of the giant freshwater stingray consists of small benthic fishes and invertebrates such as crustaceans and molluscs which it can detect using its electroreceptive ampullae of lorenzini individuals can often be seen at the edge of the river possibly feeding on earthworms parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms acanthobothrium asnihae a etini a masnihae a saliki a zainali rhinebothrium abaiensis r kinabatanganensis and r megacanthophallus the giant freshwater stingray is*****************with the developing embryos nourished initially by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk provided by the mother this species does not appear to be diadromous migrating between fresh and salt water to complete its life cycle observed litter sizes range from one to four pups newborns measure around cm in across pregnant females are frequently found in estuaries which may serve as nursery areas males mature sexually at approximately m ft across female maturation size and other life history details are unknown human interactions the giant freshwater stingray is not aggressive but its sting is sheathed in toxic mucus and is capable of piercing bone across its range this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines*****************to a lesser extent gillnets and fish traps it is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud becoming almost impossible to lift or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater the meat and the cartilage are used large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless in the mae klong and bang pakong rivers the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums these trends pose conservation concerns the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown the*****************because this species does not survive well in captivity the major threats to the giant freshwater stingray are overfishing and habitat degradation resulting from deforestation land development and damming the construction of dams also fragments the population reducing genetic diversity and increasing the susceptibility of the resulting subpopulations to extinction due to its low reproductive rate the giant freshwater stingray is not resilient to anthropogenic pressures in central thailand and cambodia the population is estimated to have been reduced by over the past years with declines as severe as in some locations the size of rays caught has decreased significantly as well for example in cambodia the average weight of a landed ray has dropped from kg lb in*****************kg lb in the status of populations in other areas such as borneo is largely unknown as a result of documented declines the international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species as endangered overall and as critically endangered in thailand in the 1990s the thai government initiated a captive breeding program at chai nat to bolster the population of this and other freshwater stingray species until the issue of habitat degradation can be remedied however by the program had been put on hold references classification names common names

killer snakehead,northern snakehead,channa argus,my names jeremy wade im a biologist with a passion for dangerous fish the big the bad and the ugly what a monster this thing is now im after a predator thats invading america watch your pets watch your children it has spawned horror movies and stands accused of homicide these fish have reportedly attacked humans allegedly it can even breathe air and crawl on land but how much of this can i actually believe i intend to separate fact from fiction and to find out first hand if this beast really does attack people does its bite match the hype and could these so-called franken-fish take over ive been investigating dangerous freshwater fish for over years but ive never come across an animal quite like this before according to this website they hunt in packs it says here that they have a poisonous bite cannibalistic eats everything in its path breathes air and walks on land some of these reports make it sound like some kind of primeval throwback a creature from before the dinosaurs when fish were first starting to crawl out of the swamps theres a story here from malaysia of a man apparently who was castrated and another story here from thailand apparently somebody killed to find out if these horrific reports are true ill be heading to southeast asia as well as finding eyewitnesses i want to track down the monster that stands accused the snakehead is a fish born with a taste for flesh a beauty that turns into a beast this seems like a fish that punches well above its weight if just half of what im reading is true then the snakehead really is a beast to be reckoned with i want to meet this fish in the flesh and find out what it is truly capable of can they really breathe air and crawl across land is it true that they are spreading like a virus devouring everything in their path and are they really aggressive enough to attack and kill a human my search for this alleged killer begins in a place where it doesnt belong im in south florida pursuing an animal thats travelled halfway round the world and is now busy invading new territory far from its natural home when bob newland pulled a weird-looking creature from a miami backwater in he took it to floridas exotic fish lab to find out what it was when i got it there i just dropped it right on the floor and i said ok paul what is this and he just looked at me and said i dont know and then he got a big book and looked in the book and then he said this is what it is its a snakehead he wanted to know where i caught it i said on a golf course in tamarac he said no i need to know what hole you found it on government scientist paul shafland had to act fast what we had hoped was that they would only be in one pond and if they were in one pond we could go in and eradicate but when his team checked the surrounding canals it was bad news snakehead the invaders were already on the move south florida is a maze of interconnected canals we couldnt have created a more ideal habitat for snakeheads shafland is up against the bullseye snakehead but this is just one member of a much larger gang snakeheads are in fact a group of almost different species that range in size from a small flick knife to a four-foot torpedo theyre ambush predators with long camouflaged bodies ripping teeth and a reputation for extreme aggression their global empire already stretches from tropical africa to the far east including russia and they seem to be spreading soon after newlands discovery a second species surfaced in maryland just miles from washington dc the northern snakehead is built to survive cold siberian winters and its presence set off alarm bells in the government and the media these fish are top-level predators that will eat anything in their path they can travel across land and live out of water for three days snakeheads reportedly even attacked humans echoing attacked humans - argh - dad this just sort of took off and exploded with the media people said do we have to worry about our children being attacked on the way to school can we leave our pets in the yard or will the snakeheads eat them meanwhile scientists from the fish and wildlife department feared that these snakeheads could unleash ecological havoc and in a bid to wipe them out they poisoned an entire pond killing every last fish yet despite efforts to exterminate them northern snakeheads are now established in five states across the eastern us media hype is one thing but when a government is spending millions of dollars to fight a fish you know youve got a serious problem i never expected that id be fishing in a quiet residential area for fish that have been branded worse than piranhas im in south florida just a few miles from where snakeheads first showed up to catch one of these alien invaders im using a lure that imitates live prey most baits and lures youve got the hook exposed but here if a fish grabs it thats what happens i hook up with local guide alan zaremba an experienced snakehead angler very nice look at that oh oh first cast and the frog had a huge a huge lump of salad with it as well and the fish went for meat and veg but didnt hook up - ah that was a hit and a miss - another snakehead the problem with the snakeheads is you get one shot at em they dont come back for a second shot what do they eat its not just fish anything thats moving that they can ambush the adults at least appear to be ione hunters theyre not swarming in packs like piranhas but as i work the banks its clear that these canals are crawling with snakeheads oh yes - that was a hit - that was a hit take a long cast up that way maybe hes got some amigos here great shot are these fish are still part of the first wave i wonder or has an invasion already become an occupation theyre here and youre not gonna stop em youre not gonna stop these fish they seem to love these shallow areas especially if you get some weeds - did you see that - let it drop set the hook that is a fish on that one came out right from the side didnt it that came out four or five feet its wake just arrowing out ive hooked my first snakehead and what it lacks in size it more than makes up for with attitude here we go thats it a bullseye snakehead now ive got my hands on one of these things i can see why its called a snakehead a very long thin muscular fish i think very often fish which are long and quite snakelike do give quite a strong fight this particular one is called a bullseye snakehead because of this eyespot on the tail have a look inside the mouth there we go thats definitely the mouth of a predator all those teeth there and its not just smaller fish that it eats it eats frogs i was using an imitation frog also things like lizards rats even small ducks these fish are clearly carnivorous but do they deserve their reputation for extreme aggression its very easy to go on the internet and in a matter of a few minutes you find stuff like this these are clips put up by people who keep pet snakeheads this is what happens when they feed them live fish just like pet snakes these predatory fish prefer their food alive when they strike it just happens too fast to see its certainly too fast for the small fish to take any avoiding action people always talk about predators being aggressive most predators kill for a reason they need food but these fish just seem to kill as a reflex - bite something in half and then just leave it to die im used to fishing for predators but seeing the moment of the strike close up is gruesome they really do seem to be natural born killers these pet snakeheads are mere minnows just imagine what a 40-pounder could do to a child or a dog looking at these clips really begs the question who set these violent offenders loose in america and why lieutenant pat reynolds keeps a close eye on the illegal wildlife trade in south florida and was called in to investigate i think theyre getting a delivery of salt water products here the guy has a game fish in the back of his truck and you cannot sell it when this fish was first found in the waterways here what was your involvement i was alerted by our fishery biologists they suspected very strongly that these were released particularly in the um oriental trade or the asian trade quite frankly the first store i went into had em and we tracked them back to new york city they were coming in through new york brought down here by an oriental wholesaler who was distributing them to the market i inspected the airport in miami and yes they did come in we made arrests and we seized the fish possessing a live snakehead can now land you in jail but youre allowed to catch and even sell these fish if you put them on ice snakeheads are highly prized by many asian-americans not just since they taste good how much do they go for oh or each when we sell it helps the healing process yes yeah we believe they were intentionally released with the idea that they could that an entrepreneur or businessman was gonna go catch em and sell em into this trade not keeping one in a tank and its too big or they get bored and put it in the water no somebody intentionally put em out there so they could harvest em later and they wouldnt have to import it from new york heres what we tell everybody if you catch em cos they are good eating dont throw it back put it on ice take it home and eat it lieutenant reynolds never did catch the entrepreneur who dropped the bullseye snakehead into florida and since it first turned up in the invader has continued to spread inland im now at the very edge of the canal network where it borders on the everglades national park could snakeheads have come this far you landed right on top of something there i hit it that was a peacock wasnt it if this was a snakehead that would be it but this is a peacock bass territorial yeah yeah yeah the peacock bass is also a non-native predator but it was brought in officially as a biological control to eat invasive species like tilapia its intolerance to cold water prevents it from spreading this is another fish that is a long way away from home this is a native of the amazon - the peacock bass they call it a butterfly peacock bass its a smaller variety of those definitely a predator big mouth but not as toothy as the snakehead but very capacious mouth there and one thing thats interesting about this - its also got an eyespot thats why they call this the peacock bass so its similar in that respect to the snakehead but one noticeable difference between this and the snakehead is the body shape this one is flattened that way laterally if this was to fall on the ground it would flop around in the same position the snakehead is flattened that way if that falls on the ground and fiaps around its actually going to move the snakehead can wriggle its way overland and find a new home thats why they worry about them here soon after they arrived here snakeheads caught the imagination of filmmakers the alien invaders were cast as slithering assassins as super fish that could somehow crawl out of the water and attack dogs or unsuspecting humans its easy to dismiss this movie monster as pure fantasy and yet remarkably much of it is based on fact some of the traits that the media picked up on are true the fish can survive out of water some of them can move overland they do have high levels of aggression does this mean that snakeheads could under certain conditions become the backyard predators of our nightmares screaming fish biologist ray waldner has studied snakeheads in detail it is an air breather it can use atmospheric oxygen youll see the fish come up to the surface lift its head up a little bit grab a mouthful of air and then submerge again snakeheads have a special chamber above the gills that acts as a simple lung when it gulps air oxygen diffuses into an encircling mesh of blood vessels if theyre in a very stagnant area where the oxygen levels in the water are very very low the fish is still able to survive so they can survive under conditions that would definitely kill other fishes but it also allows the fish to live out of the water so far so hollywood but are snakeheads mobile enough to threaten anyone on land a few years ago paul shafland brought some back to his lab and put them to the test hes moving ok but hes not making a real directional movement most of the time they sat like this with a little bit of flipping but the snakehead has just soft pectorals it doesnt have a way to support itself they seem to burn out pretty quick experts agree that some snakeheads do travel across land in areas with seasonal flooding it enables them to spread into new lakes and rivers the patio-prowling monster however looks suspiciously like a myth in their element ive seen that snakeheads hit fast and hit hard they are very aggressive anything that comes close they will tear into leaving aside any possible threat to people im starting to wonder what happens to other animals when the fish equivalent of special forces suddenly turns up i dont think theres much around that they probably wouldnt go after undoubtedly snakeheads are feeding on these native fishes such as bass and sunfish the crappies that we have here the golden shiners all of those are fair game and there are numerous others as well if theres anything thats a little bit different about the bullseye snakeheads feeding habits its the breadth of foods that it will take if something is close enough to it and it can get it in its mouth itll eat it this is a stomach from a bullseye snakehead this is a tilapia theyll also eat native fish theres two mosquitofish in there this is a crayfish that was in a stomach this is the marine toad theyve even had a snake and as you can see the whole snake was eaten this is actually a cannibalistic snakehead this is a juvenile snakehead there have even been some turtles the breadth is very interesting snakeheads are starting to sound like eco-monsters invaders with the power to mow down everything in their path weve got a fish that could be potentially devastating the danger is to the native fishes native aquatic species thats where the problem lies snakeheads it seems hold all the aces not only can they thrive in stagnant water but females are able to produce young per year and it gets worse my main concern comes because snakeheads show very extreme parental care they vehemently aggressively guard their spawn and will voraciously attack anything that comes close to them anything that poses a threat with such fertile and protective parents snakeheads have the potential to multiply rapidly whats more few native predators are willing to take on an adult snakehead so theres little to keep them in check but it wasnt always like this years ago the us had a home-grown monster that outgunned any snakehead the monstrous aiiigator gar can grow up to ten feet long and weight in at over 300ib its jaws bristle with rows of dagger-like teeth and it is protected by a prehistoric-looking armoured coat but accused of savage attacks on humans this super predator has been wiped out across most of its natural range leaving a continent-wide ecological vacuum virgin hunting grounds for an opportunistic hunter like a snakehead nothing more than an earth bank now stands between floridas snakehead infestation and the everglades national park a vital refuge for endangered wildlife despite its jack the ripper reputation the bullseye snakehead is in one sense just another addition to floridas existing roll call of exotic wildlife every year some million live animals are brought into the us to supply a pet trade worth billions of dollars in florida many of these foreign imports have escaped and become permanent residents to get an idea of how many exotic fish there are here and to put the snakehead invasion into some kind of context i join a fish and wildlife team on the canals bursts of electricity from the boats electrodes leave any nearby fish temporarily stunned allowing us to scoop them out and drop them into a holding tank for later inspection thats a florida gar first one ive seen out of the water native species like this will be returned to the water but any non-natives like snakeheads will be put on ice and killed im amazed to discover such a rich mix of native and exotic species living cheek by jowl in a single small canal after an hour we pull over to examine our catch biuegill whats that thats ok this is a biuegill thats a native species so that goes back in the water this is a bit like a fairground lucky dip spider tilapia grams thats an exotic so this one not such good news this one goes in the box peacock thats a peacock bass peacock and that is grams and this is a peacock bass although this is from south america from the amazon this was one introduced officially this one has got a visa this is not an illegal immigrant this one can go in the water bullseye snakehead ok so that is unfortunately for this one its in the box so it really is a melting pot ive seen fish from africa southeast asia central america theyre all here in north america florida currently has kinds of resident exotic fish and out of these snakeheads are said to be the best eating local angler martin arostegui has offered to cook one up well guys heres the snakehead - wonderful - all ready moment of truth ive heard this is very good it smells very good - put a little sauce on it - a bit of both either one ok nice and white thats very nice its really nice im glad you liked it though i cant swear to the snakeheads medicinal powers i can confirm that this fish is excellent eating with such large and tasty fillets its a wonder there arent more people catching them for dinner as well as providing good sport this would also help keep these unwanted predators in check just how far these intruders will spread is hard to predict but america already has another alien invader that could perhaps show me where the snakehead story is heading my destination is the illinois river skipper and research scientist greg sass isnt taking any chances whats the idea behind the net this gives a little defence for the driver trying to protect himself and what happened there occasionally we get such large ones that come up into the net with such force that they blow a hole right through it years ago catfish farmers in the south imported a fish from china to clean up waste from the breeding ponds before long some escaped into the wild and began spreading north through the mississippi river system like snakeheads today they werent an obvious problem at first then almost overnight they became a plague just absolutely full of fish down here nice flat calm surface but theres loads of them down there quite a fish soup in fact its not until greg accelerates though that the show begins these are siiver carp and at up to pounds theyre a serious danger to anyone in an open boat quite literally theyve smashed peoples ribs and knocked people overboard oh biimey seeing these as dots on the sonar is one thing but the noise of our motor provokes this mass escape response theres up to tons of these fish for every mile in the river and that hundreds of miles they go all the way down to the mouth of the mississippi just ten years ago the carp were virtually unknown here now theyve all but taken over agh absoiutely stiff with fish look at this theres more siiver than green in the water there i actually feel the boat being buffeted as they bang into it oops so who needs a rod when these things just jump into the boat the real key to the success of this fish is in here theres the red of the gill filaments and then in front of that that is basically a filter and nothing really gets through that that filters down to objects the size of four microns thats a speck of dust its a bit like us feeding every time we breathe basically thats why theyre putting on weight by removing everything from the water they leave nothing for the native species like buffalo also filter feeders but not as good at it as these chaps so the native species are gradually losing weight and if they get too thin theyre not able to breed and thats why these things are taking over as they put the squeeze on native fishes the carp are also knocking out an entire fishing industry if a filter feeder can cause such damage then what about a hardcore predator are snakeheads like these siiver carp also destined to explode out of control my guess is were going to see some real problems arise in the next several years from snakeheads both competing with and preying upon our native fishes the fish have the potential to absolutely take over between them the bullseye and northern snakeheads have what it takes to overrun most of north america if they do then fisheries worth over billion to the economy could take a massive hit and it doesnt end here a third much larger member of the gang has been turning up sporadically from maine down to arkansas the giant snakehead is a beast that can weigh as much as a five-year-old child and it comes with a nasty reputation ive heard stories of the giant snakehead attacking humans and even a case of one individual being killed by a giant snakehead to track down this would-be invader and find out if it really is as dangerous as people say i must travel to the far side of the world im in thailand and i waste no time heading upcountry my destination is a place called khao laem a remote dam on the upper reaches of the river kwai close to the burmese border this is prime snakehead habitat and ive come here in the middle of the monsoon just when the fish are at their most aggressive its their breeding season and theyre said to attack anything that comes close to their fry including people yet the giant snakehead is also a popular food fish many people here farm them to sell snakehead really do lend themselves to this type of business this type of culture they are really tolerant to low oxygen levels in the water you can see theyre coming up to the air blowing out spent air and taking another gulp and also they look very pretty when theyre small you can absolutely understand why people would want those in their aquarium in florida even in these cramped conditions the giant snakehead fry are thriving by one month theyve doubled in size and are growing ever more hungry for flesh breakfast is pulped fish but this ravenous swarm has never been hand-fed so its going to be a test of nerve for them as well as for me ive watched snakeheads not much bigger than these rip into finger-sized fish theres one or two pecking agh right up to late juvenile stage these snakeheads school and feed together the stories ive read of voracious packs are starting to make sense ive come to thailand to find out if the giant snakehead really does attack people all the reports of snakehead attacks on humans concern just one species - the giant snakehead like many here sombat lives by the water and often encounters these aggressive fish what happened was that he needed to swim underneath his raft to replace some of the bamboo it gets a bit rotten its as hes fixing his raft that sombat senses something behind him with nowhere to hide hes face to face with a giant snakehead it put its fins out a bit like an elephant threatening to charge before sombat can move the fish has savaged his foot it was bleeding so bad that he went to the hospital they didnt believe a fish was responsible they thought it was a dog and ended up giving him rabies jabs so what weve got here is a very dramatic example of what appears to be a completely unprovoked attack sombats story proves to me that a giant snakehead will attack something far bigger than itself it seems to be a fish that really does punch well above its weight like its cousin the bullseye the giant snakehead is an ambush predator that favours areas with plenty of cover for several hours i work the banks and shallow bays of the dam without getting so much as a nibble fishing for snakeheads here is a world away from florida where the hits came thick and fast with sombats story still fresh in my mind i send a lure towards an abandoned raft oh yes whee a giant snakehead whoo this fish is only one-tenth the size of a full-grown adult but its certainly got some attitude very toothy i wonder if i can just get my hand in there its snakelike appearance has led to the belief in some places that this fish has a poisonous bite fortunately this simply isnt true that is yeah that is a bit of a toothy critter although its got a fierce reputation quite a beautiful fish really ive hand-fed the carnivorous fry and been snapped at by a bolshie juvenile but everyone here tells me that if i want to catch the daddy then i must first pay a visit to the man who knows how to find this snakehead guru i travel deeper into khao laems muddy backwaters khun da is the master hunter over the past years hes gained an unrivalled knowledge of his quarry forget nets or rods for da catching a giant snakehead is more like armed combat and his weapon of choice is the spear gun the problem with this spear gun is that it takes a long time to reload so khun das actually invented his own rapid reload spear which is much simpler but much more effective the key feature of das home-made gun is that he can re-arm it quickly as he explains this is crucial when youre hunting a fish that defends in pairs speaks thai unusually for a fish snakeheads fiercely guard their young but das own close-quarter observations add a further twist to the story while the father corrals the cluster of fry the mother patrols at a distance primed to attack anything that looks like a threat to her offspring whats interesting is that this is coming from somebody who is observing these creatures closer than any scientist and the reason is that not only his livelihood but possibly his life depends on it da knows that if he shoots one snakehead he still has to watch his back stories of people being mauled by snakeheads are not uncommon around here but now i picked up a more disturbing lead i crossed to the far side of khao laem dam just miles from burma people sometimes slip across the border to fish here for a day or two then melt back into the jungle with their catch im used to tall tales but the story im about to hear is so freakish that no-one could possibly have made it up thai fishermen khun lang vividly recalls the burmese couple that came here three years ago to hunt snakeheads speaks thai so what actually happened was that the fisherman was underwater with his spear gun shot the snakehead head-on and actually scored a direct hit the fish then just kept on coming and shoved the rear end of the metal spear through the fishermans mask and into his face the fish was just panicking so much it was thrashing the fish doesnt have a reverse gear it just kept fiapping apparently the spear actually came out the back of the mans head the wife was still sitting in the boat dived down into the water and found the fisherman dead i actually came here doubting these stories doubting this fish has been responsible for any fatalities and here we have a very graphic case of a snakehead causing a human fatality ive deliberately timed my trip here to coincide with the giant snakeheads breeding season this is when the fish are at their most aggressive as they guard their young against all comers a fleeting ripple shows me where the fry have just surfaced to gulp air by dropping my lure right on top of them im trying to provoke a strike from one of the parents but it seems that these canny adults know all about fishing lures the only snakehead that has a go is a ten-inch juvenile small snakehead with the rain beating down it soon becomes impossible to spot the fry as they surface let alone get the attention of the parents im trying to create a disturbance on the surface to wind the fish up when the water is calm youve got no competition its the only thing making a noise when youve got rain falling on the water the signals very confused youve got to land that bait much closer to the fish to get them to notice it the weather isnt about to let up but worse than this and for reasons that arent made clear ive just been told that im not allowed to fish here any more so if im ever going to get face to face with this monster im going to have to pack away my rods and do it another way i return to khun da the master hunter my plan is to dive with him as he goes after the giant snakehead with nothing more than a pair of old goggles and the home-made spear gun in these choppy conditions im straining to spot the surfacing fry yet khun das predatory eye picks out the slight ripple that gives them away ready i follow and with our target pinpointed the hunt can begin im getting a bit nervous it is totally another world down there by diving with a small camera i hope to capture the entire drama as it unfolds everything has to happen on a single breath so before going under we edge as close as we can to our target but when da suddenly slips in and vanishes without trace he leaves me scrambling to catch up bad weather has churned the water into a murky soup and with da gone i feel a stab of panic i could easily wind up getting harpooned by mistake the poor visibility is even hampering da its murky down there its murky im having second thoughts about this im starting to feel like human bait but its too late to pull out now da is a man on a mission when the fry break the surface barely a boat-length away we iaunch again but our quarry has vanished into the murk leaving da to hunt on instinct da loads i can sense were close suddenly were in the heart of the swarm i think weve got one im going to keep out of the way with a single well-aimed shot da has caught a giant snakehead sitting in a boat dangling a line over the edge believe me is easy in comparison despite taking a direct hit the fish simply seems to shrug it off doesnt like that having listened to accounts of its aggressive behaviour and seen for myself the scars on sombats foot im well aware of what this river monster is capable of so there we go that wonderful black and white colouration that is very much something that the fry will identify with bright colour its calling to them i expected this fish to end up as dinner yet in a strange twist of fate its almost unharmed das spear has pierced the muscle of its back but missed its vital organs were releasing this fish this is catch-and-release spear fishing this is going to go back and it is going to recover im just hoping it doesnt double back and have a go at me as a last farewell she is actually free now she can go if she wants there she goes its actually gone back into the lake to be reunited with the young really good to see you dont expect to see that from a fish caught on a spear of all the encounters ive had with dangerous fish this had to be one of the most unnerving down in that murky water i could hardly see anything i didnt know if i was going to be attacked by the fish or maybe end up myself on the end of the spear but over the course of my journey a clearer picture of the snakehead has emerged the two species that have reached america pose no direct threat to humans although in the eyes of many their presence is an unfolding environmental disaster but in southeast asia i have found a fish that does deserve to be called a monster the word made flesh this animal is already knocking on americas door if the giant snakehead ever gains a foothold in america then you really would have to think twice about getting in the water,the northern snakehead channa argus is a species of snakehead fish native to temperate east asia in china russia north korea and south korea their natural range goes from the amur river watershed in siberia and manchuria down to hainan it is an important food fish and one of the most cultivated in its native region with an estimated short tons t produced every year in china and korea alone due to this the northern snakehead has been exported throughout the world and has managed to establish non-native populations in central asia and north america in the united states it is found in pennsylvania virginia west virginia delaware maryland north carolina arkansas missouri and mississippi appearance the distinguishing features of a northern snakehead include a long dorsal fin with rays an anal fin with rays a small anteriorly depressed head the eyes above the middle part of the upper jaw a large mouth extending well beyond the eye and villiform teeth in bands with large canines on the lower jaw and palatines it is generally reported to reach a length up to cm ft in but specimens approaching cm ft in are known according to russian ichthyologists the largest registered by the international game fish association weighs kg lb oz its coloration is a golden tan to pale brown with dark blotches on the sides and saddle-like blotches across the back blotches toward the front tend to separate between top and bottom sections while rear blotches are more likely to be contiguous coloration is nearly the same between juveniles and adults which is unusual among snakeheads and is similar to channa maculata but can be distinguished by two bar-like marks on the caudal peduncle where the tail attaches in c maculata the rear bar is usually complete with pale bar-like areas before and after while in c argus the rear bar is irregular and blotched with no pale areas around it fish similar in appearance the eyespot bowfin amia ocellicauda and northern snakehead can be found in the same waters on the swampy tidal coastal plain of the mid-atlantic united states such as the potomac and delaware river and are commonly confused with each other some contrasting differences in northern snakehead include the lack of a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle a golden tan to brown coloration with dark splotches a longer anal fin a more elongated head and an upper jaw that is shorter than its lower jaw another noticeable difference is that the northern snakehead has scales that continue uniformly from the body through to their head whereas bowfin heads are smooth and free of scales behavior the northern snakehead is a freshwater species and cannot tolerate salinity in excess of parts per million it is a facultative air breather it uses a suprabranchial organ and a bifurcated ventral aorta that permit aquatic and aerial respiration this unusual respiratory system allows it to live outside of water for several days it can wriggle its way to other bodies of water or survive being transported by humans only young of this species not adults may be able to move overland for short distances using wriggling motions the preferred habitats of this species are stagnant water with mud substrate and aquatic vegetation or slow murky swampy streams it is primarily piscivorous but is known to eat crustaceans other invertebrates and amphibians reproduction the northern snakehead can double its population in as little as years it reaches sexual maturity at age three or four when it will be about to cm ft in ft in long the eggs are fertilized externally a female can lay eggs a year fertilization occurs in shallow water in the early morning the eggs are yellow and spherical about mm in in diameter eggs hatch after about days but they can take much longer at lower temperatures the eggs are guarded by the parents until egg absorption when the eggs are about mm in long subspecies two subspecies have been recognized c a argus cantor northern snakehead china and korea c a warpachowskii berg amur snakehead eastern russia as an invasive species in its native asia the snakehead fish is considered to be an important food fish and for this reason they have been exported to many other regions around the world they were first introduced to japan from mainland asia in the early 1900s where they have since become a sport fish the ussr experimented with aquaculture of snakeheads during the mid 20th century in both europe and central asia in the united states snakeheads were only cultured in arkansas but have managed to establish populations there and several states in the mid-atlantic japan snakeheads of korean stock were first introduced to japan in the 1920s and since then have spread to about every suitable body of water on the japanese mainland europe during the cold war the ussr imported several different species of fish from eastern eurasia into europe for new prospects in aquaculture among these fish was the northern snakehead which came from the amur river basin and were stocked in various ponds of the moscow region starting in these initial experiments were successful and it was recommended that snakehead be stocked into various other waterbodies however only one shipment to czechoslovakia was ever made in and nothing else after the snakehead was also introduced to the volga delta and various ponds in yekaterinburg but are presumed to have failed due to no reports since then while the snakeheads were reported to have been breeding in moscow in the 1950s they have since disappeared there are no known populations in europe in this moment central asia the snakehead has managed to establish themselves in the countries of kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan all of which used to be part of the former soviet union more specifically they are known to be in the amu darya syr darya and kashka-darya since the 1960s due to both accidental and intentional releases since then snakeheads have also been introduced to the sarysu river talas river and chu river they have become an important commercial fish in the region with around metric tons being harvested from just the talas in united states the fish first appeared in us news when an alert fisherman discovered one in a crofton maryland pond in the summer of the northern snakehead was considered a threat to the chesapeake bay watershed and wary officials took action by draining the pond in an attempt to destroy the species the action was successful and two adults and over juvenile fish were found and destroyed a man admitted having released two adults which he had purchased from a new york city market into the pond when the northern snakehead was found in crofton the piscicide rotenone was added to the three adjacent ponds the chemical breaks down rapidly and has a half-life in water of one to three days this method of containment kills all fish present in a body of water and its use prevents the spread of the highly invasive snakehead in northern snakeheads were captured in the potomac river and they were later confirmed to have become established ie they were breeding they are somewhat limited to that stretch of the river and its local tributaries upstream by the great falls and downstream by the salinity of the chesapeake bay tests found they are not related to northern snakeheads found in other waters in the region alleviating some concern of their overland migration northern snakeheads continue to be caught in the river as of the northern snakehead has been found in three counties of florida and may already be established there apparently unestablished specimens have been found in flushing meadowscorona park in new york city two ponds in philadelphia pennsylvania a pond in massachusetts and reservoirs in california and north carolina in the northern snakehead was found in drainage ditches in arkansas as a result of a commercial fish-farming accident recent flooding may have allowed the species to spread into the nearby white river which would allow an eventual population of the fish in the arkansas river and mississippi river in the summer of an infestation of the northern snakehead was confirmed in ridgebury lake and catlin creek near ridgebury new york by august the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec had collected a number of the native fish and then poisoned the waters with a liquid rotenone formulation after the poisoning the nysdec had to identify measure and additionally process the fish to adhere with new york bureau of fisheries procedures before disposal the treatment plan was operated under several agents and new york state police were placed on stand-by in case of protests by local residents1 in april sightings of the species in central parks harlem meer prompted new york city officials to urge anglers to report and capture any individuals ron p swegman author of several angling essays on central parks ponds confirmed the species had put both anglers and the state of new yorks department of environmental protection on high alert on june caleb newton a resident of spotsylvania county virginia caught a kg lb oz northern snakehead from the junction of aquia creek and the potomac river beating the previous world record of lb oz kg caught in in miki kagawa prefecture japan in late authorities in maryland and virginia were counting snakeheads in the chesapeake bay to better understand the impact of the introduction of the fish to the local ecosystem the commonwealth of virginia has criminalized the introduction of snakeheads into the state without specific authorization although the relevant statute does not explain whether mere importation is sufficient to constitute introduction into the commonwealth or whether instead release into the environment is required on may 2014 luis aragon of triangle virginia caught a lb oz kg northern snakehead which was officially listed as the biggest ever caught on rod and reel according to the international game fish association on may 2016 emory dutch baldwin of indian head maryland boated an lb kg northern snakehead in a tidal marsh of the potomac using archery tackle this fish was listed as the state sport record in maryland by the maryland department of natural resources on the night of may 2018 andrew andy fox of mechanicsville maryland shot a northern snakehead with a bow and arrow which was officially listed as the biggest ever shot according to the maryland department of natural resources the record-breaking northern snakehead weighed lb kg with a length of inches cm the snakehead was shot in mattawoman creek in charles county maryland near indian head in october a number of northern snakeheads were found in a pond on private property in gwinnett county georgia in august a 30-inch cm snakehead weighing pounds kg was caught in a reservoir in canton massachusetts in a snakehead was confirmed at the duck creek conservation area in southeast missouri a new concern is that this fishs spreading is getting close to the great lakes which it may enter and disrupt that ecosystem canada in a suspected northern snakehead was found in a pond in burnaby british columbia but further study revealed that it had been released three months or less before its capture and that it was a blotched snakehead or perhaps a hybrid involving that species before its exact identity was revealed the government of british columbia introduced legislation banning the possession of snakeheads and several other potentially invasive species however unlike the northern snakehead which could establish a population in parts of canada the blotched snakehead generally lives only in warmer waters than those found in canada world record according to the international game fish association damien cook caught a world-record kg lb oz northern snakehead in dorchester county maryland united states on july in traditional culture northern snakeheads are respected among some chinese fishermen for their virtue as parent snakefish are known to sacrifice themselves to protect their young the young fish

dangerous fish the big the bad and the ugly what a monster this thing is now im after a predator thats invading america watch your pets watch your children it has spawned horror movies and stands accused of homicide these fish have reportedly attacked humans allegedly it can even breathe air and crawl on land but how much of this can i actually believe i intend to separate fact from fiction and to find out first hand if this beast really does attack people does its bite match the hype and could these so-called franken-fish take over ive been investigating dangerous freshwater fish for over years but ive never come across an animal quite like this before according to this website they hunt in packs it says here that they have a poisonous bite cannibalistic eats everything in its*****************breathes air and walks on land some of these reports make it sound like some kind of primeval throwback a creature from before the dinosaurs when fish were first starting to crawl out of the swamps theres a story here from malaysia of a man apparently who was castrated and another story here from thailand apparently somebody killed to find out if these horrific reports are true ill be heading to southeast asia as well as finding eyewitnesses i want to track down the monster that stands accused the snakehead is a fish born with a taste for flesh a beauty that turns into a beast this seems like a fish that punches well above its weight if just*****************of what im reading is true then the snakehead really is a beast to be reckoned with i want to meet this fish in the flesh and find out what it is truly capable of can they really breathe air and crawl across land is it true that they are spreading like a virus devouring everything in their path and are they really aggressive enough to attack and kill a human my search for this alleged killer begins in a place where it doesnt belong im in south florida pursuing an animal thats travelled halfway round the world and is now busy invading new territory far from its natural home when bob newland pulled a weird-looking creature from a*****************backwater in he took it to floridas exotic fish lab to find out what it was when i got it there i just dropped it right on the floor and i said ok paul what is this and he just looked at me and said i dont know and then he got a big book and looked in the book and then he said this is what it is its a snakehead he wanted to know where i caught it i said on a golf course in tamarac he said no i need to know what hole you found it on government scientist paul shafland had to act fast what we had hoped was that they would only be*****************one pond and if they were in one pond we could go in and eradicate but when his team checked the surrounding canals it was bad news snakehead the invaders were already on the move south florida is a maze of interconnected canals we couldnt have created a more ideal habitat for snakeheads shafland is up against the bullseye snakehead but this is just one member of a much larger gang snakeheads are in fact a group of almost different species that range in size from a small flick knife to a four-foot torpedo theyre ambush predators with long camouflaged bodies ripping teeth and a reputation for extreme aggression their global empire already stretches from tropical africa to the*****************east including russia and they seem to be spreading soon after newlands discovery a second species surfaced in maryland just miles from washington dc the northern snakehead is built to survive cold siberian winters and its presence set off alarm bells in the government and the media these fish are top-level predators that will eat anything in their path they can travel across land and live out of water for three days snakeheads reportedly even attacked humans echoing attacked humans - argh - dad this just sort of took off and exploded with the media people said do we have to worry about our children being attacked on the way to school can we leave our pets in the*****************or will the snakeheads eat them meanwhile scientists from the fish and wildlife department feared that these snakeheads could unleash ecological havoc and in a bid to wipe them out they poisoned an entire pond killing every last fish yet despite efforts to exterminate them northern snakeheads are now established in five states across the eastern us media hype is one thing but when a government is spending millions of dollars to fight a fish you know youve got a serious problem i never expected that id be fishing in a quiet residential area for fish that have been branded worse than piranhas im in south florida just a few miles from where snakeheads first showed up to catch*****************of these alien invaders im using a lure that imitates live prey most baits and lures youve got the hook exposed but here if a fish grabs it thats what happens i hook up with local guide alan zaremba an experienced snakehead angler very nice look at that oh oh first cast and the frog had a huge a huge lump of salad with it as well and the fish went for meat and veg but didnt hook up - ah that was a hit and a miss - another snakehead the problem with the snakeheads is you get one shot at em they dont come back for a second shot what do they eat its not just fish*****************thats moving that they can ambush the adults at least appear to be ione hunters theyre not swarming in packs like piranhas but as i work the banks its clear that these canals are crawling with snakeheads oh yes - that was a hit - that was a hit take a long cast up that way maybe hes got some amigos here great shot are these fish are still part of the first wave i wonder or has an invasion already become an occupation theyre here and youre not gonna stop em youre not gonna stop these fish they seem to love these shallow areas especially if you get some weeds - did you see that - let it*****************set the hook that is a fish on that one came out right from the side didnt it that came out four or five feet its wake just arrowing out ive hooked my first snakehead and what it lacks in size it more than makes up for with attitude here we go thats it a bullseye snakehead now ive got my hands on one of these things i can see why its called a snakehead a very long thin muscular fish i think very often fish which are long and quite snakelike do give quite a strong fight this particular one is called a bullseye snakehead because of this eyespot on the tail have a look inside the mouth*****************we go thats definitely the mouth of a predator all those teeth there and its not just smaller fish that it eats it eats frogs i was using an imitation frog also things like lizards rats even small ducks these fish are clearly carnivorous but do they deserve their reputation for extreme aggression its very easy to go on the internet and in a matter of a few minutes you find stuff like this these are clips put up by people who keep pet snakeheads this is what happens when they feed them live fish just like pet snakes these predatory fish prefer their food alive when they strike it just happens too fast to see its certainly too*****************for the small fish to take any avoiding action people always talk about predators being aggressive most predators kill for a reason they need food but these fish just seem to kill as a reflex - bite something in half and then just leave it to die im used to fishing for predators but seeing the moment of the strike close up is gruesome they really do seem to be natural born killers these pet snakeheads are mere minnows just imagine what a 40-pounder could do to a child or a dog looking at these clips really begs the question who set these violent offenders loose in america and why lieutenant pat reynolds keeps a close eye on the*****************wildlife trade in south florida and was called in to investigate i think theyre getting a delivery of salt water products here the guy has a game fish in the back of his truck and you cannot sell it when this fish was first found in the waterways here what was your involvement i was alerted by our fishery biologists they suspected very strongly that these were released particularly in the um oriental trade or the asian trade quite frankly the first store i went into had em and we tracked them back to new york city they were coming in through new york brought down here by an oriental wholesaler who was distributing them to the market i*****************the airport in miami and yes they did come in we made arrests and we seized the fish possessing a live snakehead can now land you in jail but youre allowed to catch and even sell these fish if you put them on ice snakeheads are highly prized by many asian-americans not just since they taste good how much do they go for oh or each when we sell it helps the healing process yes yeah we believe they were intentionally released with the idea that they could that an entrepreneur or businessman was gonna go catch em and sell em into this trade not keeping one in a tank and its too big or they get bored and*****************of the canal network where it borders on the everglades national park could snakeheads have come this far you landed right on top of something there i hit it that was a peacock wasnt it if this was a snakehead that would be it but this is a peacock bass territorial yeah yeah yeah the peacock bass is also a non-native predator but it was brought in officially as a biological control to eat invasive species like tilapia its intolerance to cold water prevents it from spreading this is another fish that is a long way away from home this is a native of the amazon - the peacock bass they call it a butterfly peacock bass its a smaller variety of those definitely a predator big mouth but not as toothy as the snakehead but very capacious mouth there and one thing thats interesting about this - its also*****************an eyespot thats why they call this the peacock bass so its similar in that respect to the snakehead but one noticeable difference between this and the snakehead is the body shape this one is flattened that way laterally if this was to fall on the ground it would flop around in the same position the snakehead is flattened that way if that falls on the ground and fiaps around its actually going to move the snakehead can wriggle its way overland and find a new home thats why they worry about them here soon after they arrived here snakeheads caught the imagination of filmmakers the alien invaders were cast as slithering assassins as super fish that could somehow*****************out of the water and attack dogs or unsuspecting humans its easy to dismiss this movie monster as pure fantasy and yet remarkably much of it is based on fact some of the traits that the media picked up on are true the fish can survive out of water some of them can move overland they do have high levels of aggression does this mean that snakeheads could under certain conditions become the backyard predators of our nightmares screaming fish biologist ray waldner has studied snakeheads in detail it is an air breather it can use atmospheric oxygen youll see the fish come up to the surface lift its head up a little bit grab a mouthful of air*****************then submerge again snakeheads have a special chamber above the gills that acts as a simple lung when it gulps air oxygen diffuses into an encircling mesh of blood vessels if theyre in a very stagnant area where the oxygen levels in the water are very very low the fish is still able to survive so they can survive under conditions that would definitely kill other fishes but it also allows the fish to live out of the water so far so hollywood but are snakeheads mobile enough to threaten anyone on land a few years ago paul shafland brought some back to his lab and put them to the test hes moving ok but hes not making a*****************directional movement most of the time they sat like this with a little bit of flipping but the snakehead has just soft pectorals it doesnt have a way to support itself they seem to burn out pretty quick experts agree that some snakeheads do travel across land in areas with seasonal flooding it enables them to spread into new lakes and rivers the patio-prowling monster however looks suspiciously like a myth in their element ive seen that snakeheads hit fast and hit hard they are very aggressive anything that comes close they will tear into leaving aside any possible threat to people im starting to wonder what happens to other animals when the fish equivalent of special forces suddenly*****************up i dont think theres much around that they probably wouldnt go after undoubtedly snakeheads are feeding on these native fishes such as bass and sunfish the crappies that we have here the golden shiners all of those are fair game and there are numerous others as well if theres anything thats a little bit different about the bullseye snakeheads feeding habits its the breadth of foods that it will take if something is close enough to it and it can get it in its mouth itll eat it this is a stomach from a bullseye snakehead this is a tilapia theyll also eat native fish theres two mosquitofish in there this is a crayfish that was in a*****************this is the marine toad theyve even had a snake and as you can see the whole snake was eaten this is actually a cannibalistic snakehead this is a juvenile snakehead there have even been some turtles the breadth is very interesting snakeheads are starting to sound like eco-monsters invaders with the power to mow down everything in their path weve got a fish that could be potentially devastating the danger is to the native fishes native aquatic species thats where the problem lies snakeheads it seems hold all the aces not only can they thrive in stagnant water but females are able to produce young per year and it gets worse my main concern comes because snakeheads show*****************extreme parental care they vehemently aggressively guard their spawn and will voraciously attack anything that comes close to them anything that poses a threat with such fertile and protective parents snakeheads have the potential to multiply rapidly whats more few native predators are willing to take on an adult snakehead so theres little to keep them in check but it wasnt always like this years ago the us had a home-grown monster that outgunned any snakehead the monstrous aiiigator gar can grow up to ten feet long and weight in at over 300ib its jaws bristle with rows of dagger-like teeth and it is protected by a prehistoric-looking armoured coat but accused of savage attacks on humans this super*****************has been wiped out across most of its natural range leaving a continent-wide ecological vacuum virgin hunting grounds for an opportunistic hunter like a snakehead nothing more than an earth bank now stands between floridas snakehead infestation and the everglades national park a vital refuge for endangered wildlife despite its jack the ripper reputation the bullseye snakehead is in one sense just another addition to floridas existing roll call of exotic wildlife every year some million live animals are brought into the us to supply a pet trade worth billions of dollars in florida many of these foreign imports have escaped and become permanent residents to get an idea of how many exotic fish there are here and to*****************the snakehead invasion into some kind of context i join a fish and wildlife team on the canals bursts of electricity from the boats electrodes leave any nearby fish temporarily stunned allowing us to scoop them out and drop them into a holding tank for later inspection thats a florida gar first one ive seen out of the water native species like this will be returned to the water but any non-natives like snakeheads will be put on ice and killed im amazed to discover such a rich mix of native and exotic species living cheek by jowl in a single small canal after an hour we pull over to examine our catch biuegill whats that thats ok this*****************a biuegill thats a native species so that goes back in the water this is a bit like a fairground lucky dip spider tilapia grams thats an exotic so this one not such good news this one goes in the box peacock thats a peacock bass peacock and that is grams and this is a peacock bass although this is from south america from the amazon this was one introduced officially this one has got a visa this is not an illegal immigrant this one can go in the water bullseye snakehead ok so that is unfortunately for this one its in the box so it really is a melting pot ive seen fish from africa southeast asia central*****************theyre all here in north america florida currently has kinds of resident exotic fish and out of these snakeheads are said to be the best eating local angler martin arostegui has offered to cook one up well guys heres the snakehead - wonderful - all ready moment of truth ive heard this is very good it smells very good - put a little sauce on it - a bit of both either one ok nice and white thats very nice its really nice im glad you liked it though i cant swear to the snakeheads medicinal powers i can confirm that this fish is excellent eating with such large and tasty fillets its a wonder there arent more people*****************them for dinner as well as providing good sport this would also help keep these unwanted predators in check just how far these intruders will spread is hard to predict but america already has another alien invader that could perhaps show me where the snakehead story is heading my destination is the illinois river skipper and research scientist greg sass isnt taking any chances whats the idea behind the net this gives a little defence for the driver trying to protect himself and what happened there occasionally we get such large ones that come up into the net with such force that they blow a hole right through it years ago catfish farmers in the south imported a fish*****************china to clean up waste from the breeding ponds before long some escaped into the wild and began spreading north through the mississippi river system like snakeheads today they werent an obvious problem at first then almost overnight they became a plague just absolutely full of fish down here nice flat calm surface but theres loads of them down there quite a fish soup in fact its not until greg accelerates though that the show begins these are siiver carp and at up to pounds theyre a serious danger to anyone in an open boat quite literally theyve smashed peoples ribs and knocked people overboard oh biimey seeing these as dots on the sonar is one thing but the*****************of our motor provokes this mass escape response theres up to tons of these fish for every mile in the river and that hundreds of miles they go all the way down to the mouth of the mississippi just ten years ago the carp were virtually unknown here now theyve all but taken over agh absoiutely stiff with fish look at this theres more siiver than green in the water there i actually feel the boat being buffeted as they bang into it oops so who needs a rod when these things just jump into the boat the real key to the success of this fish is in here theres the red of the gill filaments and then in*****************of that that is basically a filter and nothing really gets through that that filters down to objects the size of four microns thats a speck of dust its a bit like us feeding every time we breathe basically thats why theyre putting on weight by removing everything from the water they leave nothing for the native species like buffalo also filter feeders but not as good at it as these chaps so the native species are gradually losing weight and if they get too thin theyre not able to breed and thats why these things are taking over as they put the squeeze on native fishes the carp are also knocking out an entire fishing industry if a*****************feeder can cause such damage then what about a hardcore predator are snakeheads like these siiver carp also destined to explode out of control my guess is were going to see some real problems arise in the next several years from snakeheads both competing with and preying upon our native fishes the fish have the potential to absolutely take over between them the bullseye and northern snakeheads have what it takes to overrun most of north america if they do then fisheries worth over billion to the economy could take a massive hit and it doesnt end here a third much larger member of the gang has been turning up sporadically from maine down to arkansas the giant snakehead*****************a beast that can weigh as much as a five-year-old child and it comes with a nasty reputation ive heard stories of the giant snakehead attacking humans and even a case of one individual being killed by a giant snakehead to track down this would-be invader and find out if it really is as dangerous as people say i must travel to the far side of the world im in thailand and i waste no time heading upcountry my destination is a place called khao laem a remote dam on the upper reaches of the river kwai close to the burmese border this is prime snakehead habitat and ive come here in the middle of the monsoon just when*****************fish are at their most aggressive its their breeding season and theyre said to attack anything that comes close to their fry including people yet the giant snakehead is also a popular food fish many people here farm them to sell snakehead really do lend themselves to this type of business this type of culture they are really tolerant to low oxygen levels in the water you can see theyre coming up to the air blowing out spent air and taking another gulp and also they look very pretty when theyre small you can absolutely understand why people would want those in their aquarium in florida even in these cramped conditions the giant snakehead fry are thriving by one*****************theyve doubled in size and are growing ever more hungry for flesh breakfast is pulped fish but this ravenous swarm has never been hand-fed so its going to be a test of nerve for them as well as for me ive watched snakeheads not much bigger than these rip into finger-sized fish theres one or two pecking agh right up to late juvenile stage these snakeheads school and feed together the stories ive read of voracious packs are starting to make sense ive come to thailand to find out if the giant snakehead really does attack people all the reports of snakehead attacks on humans concern just one species - the giant snakehead like many here sombat lives by*****************water and often encounters these aggressive fish what happened was that he needed to swim underneath his raft to replace some of the bamboo it gets a bit rotten its as hes fixing his raft that sombat senses something behind him with nowhere to hide hes face to face with a giant snakehead it put its fins out a bit like an elephant threatening to charge before sombat can move the fish has savaged his foot it was bleeding so bad that he went to the hospital they didnt believe a fish was responsible they thought it was a dog and ended up giving him rabies jabs so what weve got here is a very dramatic example of what*****************to be a completely unprovoked attack sombats story proves to me that a giant snakehead will attack something far bigger than itself it seems to be a fish that really does punch well above its weight like its cousin the bullseye the giant snakehead is an ambush predator that favours areas with plenty of cover for several hours i work the banks and shallow bays of the dam without getting so much as a nibble fishing for snakeheads here is a world away from florida where the hits came thick and fast with sombats story still fresh in my mind i send a lure towards an abandoned raft oh yes whee a giant snakehead whoo this fish is only*****************the size of a full-grown adult but its certainly got some attitude very toothy i wonder if i can just get my hand in there its snakelike appearance has led to the belief in some places that this fish has a poisonous bite fortunately this simply isnt true that is yeah that is a bit of a toothy critter although its got a fierce reputation quite a beautiful fish really ive hand-fed the carnivorous fry and been snapped at by a bolshie juvenile but everyone here tells me that if i want to catch the daddy then i must first pay a visit to the man who knows how to find this snakehead guru i travel deeper into khao*****************muddy backwaters khun da is the master hunter over the past years hes gained an unrivalled knowledge of his quarry forget nets or rods for da catching a giant snakehead is more like armed combat and his weapon of choice is the spear gun the problem with this spear gun is that it takes a long time to reload so khun das actually invented his own rapid reload spear which is much simpler but much more effective the key feature of das home-made gun is that he can re-arm it quickly as he explains this is crucial when youre hunting a fish that defends in pairs speaks thai unusually for a fish snakeheads fiercely guard their young but das*****************close-quarter observations add a further twist to the story while the father corrals the cluster of fry the mother patrols at a distance primed to attack anything that looks like a threat to her offspring whats interesting is that this is coming from somebody who is observing these creatures closer than any scientist and the reason is that not only his livelihood but possibly his life depends on it da knows that if he shoots one snakehead he still has to watch his back stories of people being mauled by snakeheads are not uncommon around here but now i picked up a more disturbing lead i crossed to the far side of khao laem dam just miles from burma*****************sometimes slip across the border to fish here for a day or two then melt back into the jungle with their catch im used to tall tales but the story im about to hear is so freakish that no-one could possibly have made it up thai fishermen khun lang vividly recalls the burmese couple that came here three years ago to hunt snakeheads speaks thai so what actually happened was that the fisherman was underwater with his spear gun shot the snakehead head-on and actually scored a direct hit the fish then just kept on coming and shoved the rear end of the metal spear through the fishermans mask and into his face the fish was just panicking so*****************it was thrashing the fish doesnt have a reverse gear it just kept fiapping apparently the spear actually came out the back of the mans head the wife was still sitting in the boat dived down into the water and found the fisherman dead i actually came here doubting these stories doubting this fish has been responsible for any fatalities and here we have a very graphic case of a snakehead causing a human fatality ive deliberately timed my trip here to coincide with the giant snakeheads breeding season this is when the fish are at their most aggressive as they guard their young against all comers a fleeting ripple shows me where the fry have just surfaced to*****************air by dropping my lure right on top of them im trying to provoke a strike from one of the parents but it seems that these canny adults know all about fishing lures the only snakehead that has a go is a ten-inch juvenile small snakehead with the rain beating down it soon becomes impossible to spot the fry as they surface let alone get the attention of the parents im trying to create a disturbance on the surface to wind the fish up when the water is calm youve got no competition its the only thing making a noise when youve got rain falling on the water the signals very confused youve got to land that bait much*****************to the fish to get them to notice it the weather isnt about to let up but worse than this and for reasons that arent made clear ive just been told that im not allowed to fish here any more so if im ever going to get face to face with this monster im going to have to pack away my rods and do it another way i return to khun da the master hunter my plan is to dive with him as he goes after the giant snakehead with nothing more than a pair of old goggles and the home-made spear gun in these choppy conditions im straining to spot the surfacing fry yet khun das predatory eye*****************out the slight ripple that gives them away ready i follow and with our target pinpointed the hunt can begin im getting a bit nervous it is totally another world down there by diving with a small camera i hope to capture the entire drama as it unfolds everything has to happen on a single breath so before going under we edge as close as we can to our target but when da suddenly slips in and vanishes without trace he leaves me scrambling to catch up bad weather has churned the water into a murky soup and with da gone i feel a stab of panic i could easily wind up getting harpooned by mistake the poor visibility*****************of the way with a single well-aimed shot da has caught a giant snakehead sitting in a boat dangling a line over the edge believe me is easy in comparison despite taking a direct hit the fish simply seems to shrug it off doesnt like that having listened to accounts of its aggressive behaviour and seen for myself the scars on sombats foot im well aware of what this river monster is capable of so there we go that wonderful black and white colouration that is very much something that the fry will identify with bright colour its calling to them i expected this fish to end up as dinner yet in a strange twist of fate its almost unharmed das spear has pierced the muscle of its back but missed its vital organs were releasing this fish this is catch-and-release spear fishing this is going to go back and*****************is going to recover im just hoping it doesnt double back and have a go at me as a last farewell she is actually free now she can go if she wants there she goes its actually gone back into the lake to be reunited with the young really good to see you dont expect to see that from a fish caught on a spear of all the encounters ive had with dangerous fish this had to be one of the most unnerving down in that murky water i could hardly see anything i didnt know if i was going to be attacked by the fish or maybe end up myself on the end of the spear but over*****************course of my journey a clearer picture of the snakehead has emerged the two species that have reached america pose no direct threat to humans although in the eyes of many their presence is an unfolding environmental disaster but in southeast asia i have found a fish that does deserve to be called a monster the word made flesh this animal is already knocking on americas door if the giant snakehead ever gains a foothold in america then you really would have to think twice about getting in the water,the northern snakehead channa argus is a species of snakehead fish native to temperate east asia in china russia north korea and south korea their natural range goes from the amur river watershed in siberia and manchuria down to hainan it is an important food fish and one of the most cultivated in its native region with an estimated short tons t produced every year in china and korea alone due to this the northern snakehead has been exported throughout the world and has managed to establish non-native populations in central asia and north america in the united states it is found in pennsylvania virginia west virginia delaware maryland north carolina arkansas missouri and mississippi appearance the distinguishing features of a northern snakehead include a long dorsal fin with rays an anal fin with rays a small anteriorly depressed head the eyes above the middle part of the upper jaw*****************large mouth extending well beyond the eye and villiform teeth in bands with large canines on the lower jaw and palatines it is generally reported to reach a length up to cm ft in but specimens approaching cm ft in are known according to russian ichthyologists the largest registered by the international game fish association weighs kg lb oz its coloration is a golden tan to pale brown with dark blotches on the sides and saddle-like blotches across the back blotches toward the front tend to separate between top and bottom sections while rear blotches are more likely to be contiguous coloration is nearly the same between juveniles and adults which is unusual among snakeheads and is similar to*****************maculata but can be distinguished by two bar-like marks on the caudal peduncle where the tail attaches in c maculata the rear bar is usually complete with pale bar-like areas before and after while in c argus the rear bar is irregular and blotched with no pale areas around it fish similar in appearance the eyespot bowfin amia ocellicauda and northern snakehead can be found in the same waters on the swampy tidal coastal plain of the mid-atlantic united states such as the potomac and delaware river and are commonly confused with each other some contrasting differences in northern snakehead include the lack of a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle a golden tan to brown coloration with dark*****************a longer anal fin a more elongated head and an upper jaw that is shorter than its lower jaw another noticeable difference is that the northern snakehead has scales that continue uniformly from the body through to their head whereas bowfin heads are smooth and free of scales behavior the northern snakehead is a freshwater species and cannot tolerate salinity in excess of parts per million it is a facultative air breather it uses a suprabranchial organ and a bifurcated ventral aorta that permit aquatic and aerial respiration this unusual respiratory system allows it to live outside of water for several days it can wriggle its way to other bodies of water or survive being transported by humans only*****************of this species not adults may be able to move overland for short distances using wriggling motions the preferred habitats of this species are stagnant water with mud substrate and aquatic vegetation or slow murky swampy streams it is primarily piscivorous but is known to eat crustaceans other invertebrates and amphibians reproduction the northern snakehead can double its population in as little as years it reaches sexual maturity at age three or four when it will be about to cm ft in ft in long the eggs are fertilized externally a female can lay eggs a year fertilization occurs in shallow water in the early morning the eggs are yellow and spherical about mm in in diameter eggs hatch*****************about days but they can take much longer at lower temperatures the eggs are guarded by the parents until egg absorption when the eggs are about mm in long subspecies two subspecies have been recognized c a argus cantor northern snakehead china and korea c a warpachowskii berg amur snakehead eastern russia as an invasive species in its native asia the snakehead fish is considered to be an important food fish and for this reason they have been exported to many other regions around the world they were first introduced to japan from mainland asia in the early 1900s where they have since become a sport fish the ussr experimented with aquaculture of snakeheads during the mid 20th century*****************both europe and central asia in the united states snakeheads were only cultured in arkansas but have managed to establish populations there and several states in the mid-atlantic japan snakeheads of korean stock were first introduced to japan in the 1920s and since then have spread to about every suitable body of water on the japanese mainland europe during the cold war the ussr imported several different species of fish from eastern eurasia into europe for new prospects in aquaculture among these fish was the northern snakehead which came from the amur river basin and were stocked in various ponds of the moscow region starting in these initial experiments were successful and it was recommended that snakehead be stocked*****************various other waterbodies however only one shipment to czechoslovakia was ever made in and nothing else after the snakehead was also introduced to the volga delta and various ponds in yekaterinburg but are presumed to have failed due to no reports since then while the snakeheads were reported to have been breeding in moscow in the 1950s they have since disappeared there are no known populations in europe in this moment central asia the snakehead has managed to establish themselves in the countries

congo killer,tsuni catfish,heterobranchus longifilis,there are so many rivers around the world so many far-flung locations that i rarely return to the same place twice that is unless ive been defeated the first time but theres one place where ive longed to return a land that beat me before a region of unparalleled brutality where for over a hundred years violence and blood-letting have been a way of life i travelled here years ago but had to pick my time carefully since then continuing violence and unrest have prevented me from going back this is the congo a region lost in the dark heart of africa a land of fables legends and spirits and there is one spirit in particular called mami wata who is said to lure fishermen to the bottom of the river where theyre imprisoned for eternity far-fetched maybe not recently new stories have reached me of fishermen dragged overboard to their deaths so im heading back out there to discover if these tales are just fables and legends or if something really is lurking in the depths my name is jeremy wade what keeps me alive is catching fish but some of the moments when ive felt most alive have been those when i was closest to death only by really testing myself do i feel ive achieved anything and to do this i travel far and wide putting my own safety at risk to uncover the truth about what lurks in the worlds rivers im heading to the congo one of the few places on earth that will still really test a fisherman the congo is situated in the tropical heart of africa it is regarded as one of the most violent places on earth my plan is to travel up the congo river into the interior of this vast continent and catch myself a monster this region has enormous mineral wealth but centuries of colonial exploitation and ethnic conflict have been its ruination it now ranks among the poorest and most dangerous places on the planet i first came here to the congo river with my fishing rods years ago i was travelling through a country known then as zaire and this was a country the size of western europe but with almost no infrastructure a really difficult place to travel on top of that the country was under a dictatorship and there was a real climate of fear at the time and it was not really a place that outsiders ever came to certainly nobody travelling on their own as i was i was here for two and a half months and i didnt catch a single fish because the country being so vast and the travelling so difficult it just took me all my time to get to the river and then get out again but i did talk to people i spoke to fishermen and i heard some stories stories of fish so huge that they are said sometimes to drag the fishermen out of their dug-out canoes drowning them in the water and then i was on my way out i was travelling on a big riverboat - maybe other passengers on that boat - and i actually glimpsed one of these monsters somebody dragged it on board and i took a photograph and the memory of that fish has just stayed with me ever since but recently fresh stories have reached my ears of this place and they have rekindled the memories of that fish that i saw on the boat and theyve reminded me that me and this river have got some unfinished business the people of the congo are very superstitious they believe that this great river is inhabited by the spirit mami wata but could this water spirit actually be a rare and massive fish like the one i glimpsed all those years ago i have to find out i get my first real sight of the harshness of life in this place when we stop in a village to refuel life here is cruel and unforgiving just to survive takes incredible strength spirit and resilience merci whats slightly disturbing about this fish is that its still alive catfish tend to stay alive for a long time out of water and if you let yourself be ruled by sentiment youd bash this fish on the head put it out of its misery but if you do that it will go bad very quickly the meat will go rotten and people arent going to eat it so if you live somewhere like this sentiment goes out the window and you want to keep this thing alive for as long as possible so that it tastes good when you eat it simple as that - kamba its a kamba - kamba this one here this is the kamba this is one of the ones that grows very big its a very thick-bodied catfish its got big eyes the eyes of a predator those arent the eyes of a fish that snuffles around on the bottom its got the er the feelers like all catfish but this mouth this is an active predatory catfish and thats a small version of the animal that im after with their scaleless bodies and whisker-like tentacles catfish are incredibly diverse there are an estimated different species inhabiting every continent except antarctica i have caught them in the new world and the old but here the congo is home to over different types thats nearly three times as many as in all the rivers in north america this is the electric catfish ah but here mimics electric buzzing ok ok laughs its got very sharp spines here agh im here to catch a catfish thats rumoured to reach eight feet in length and weigh over pounds - a leviathan among the worlds river monsters the local name for the congo river is nzadi it means the river that swallows all rivers together with its countless tributaries it is the second largest river system in the world from the atlantic coast it coils its way nearly miles into africas interior draining a basin second only in area to the amazon my plan is to travel miles up-river to the village of bonga this part of the congo was isolated from the outside world until the arrival of colonisers in the latter part of the 19th century then everything changed under the voracious rule of king leopold of belgium a reign of terror turned the congo region into a prison state men were enslaved to gather wild rubber and their women and children routinely had their hands chopped off if the men failed to work hard enough ten million congolese were brutally killed to this day much of this region remains undiscovered this dark heart of africa is still as unknown to outsiders as it ever was i know little of what lies ahead as i venture into one of the darkest places on earth distant chanting the congo river is the lifeblood of this region villages clink to its banks it provides a vital transport link and is an essential source of food as i venture further north i notice that little has changed over the last years im using up valuable time and i still have miles ahead of me before i reach the place where i saw that giant fish as yet another day draws to a close im getting desperate to see what fish are in the river but i have no bait that is until the boatman suggests a local favourite soap any old soap will do its not just er your your traditional sort of animal fat-based soap but any antiseptic soap you name it erm the fish will go for it and one good thing about it is it will really give off a good scent trail down the river the catfish here are said to be among the biggest anywhere in the world ive set myself up in a quiet slack on the edge of a current a rivers a bit like a conveyor belt if you position yourself in the right place it will bring food this is just the kind of place where everything settles out and where the fish congregate but as the hours pass the only thing thats biting are the mosquitoes clicking line clicks out quickly im pretty sure that was just the current but every now and again you get a real surge but things are very quiet and thats i dont know its quite a surprise line clicks out rapidly fish on thats a fish lay this down i recognise this as one of the giant catfish species but this is just a baby even so he gave me quite an impressive run-around which is a bit scary because its said they can grow to over times this size and drag fishermen from their boats i know of catfish in the amazon big enough to swallow people whole so theres no reason why this river couldnt be home to fish of a similar size crucially for me there is virtually no commercial fishing here unlike say the amazon where you have a huge commercial fishing fleet that extracts literally tonnes of fish every day so if theres one river in the world where you might hope to find a real monster lurking undisturbed in the depths this is it this is the end of the line for this boat and as we pull into a remote fishing village i get my first sight of a congo river monster brief conversation in local language they call them eels im used to eels that are like that round and maybe inches two foot long these things theyre the thickness of your leg and maybe four getting onto five foot ill see if we can maybe get one out and have a proper look at one theyre just such weird-looking creatures im not going to put my hands in the mouth theres some pretty nasty-looking fangs in there they look sharp and they also look quite dirty and er unhygienic i think ive got an id on these i think these are lungfish - hisses - oh that is because this fish actually has an air bladder which is used as a lung so it can breathe out of water and this is a fish which can bury itself underground and survive droughts it sort of i think belched out a little bit of air and then that was a inhales deeply took some air in and then belched out of the gills small eyes generally on a fish means they dont use them much for feeding theyre probably using vibration or scent in the water more than vision to find their food this was caught with on a palm nut so it suggests you know an omnivorous feeder that mouth to me looks like its going to take fish i guess like a lot of fish round here its opportunistic itll actually chomp anything that comes its way but anyway they call this an eel and you know i have to say its the most impressive eel that ive ever seen lungfish are ancient creatures pre-dating all animals that walk on land when i look at a beast like this mami wata no longer seems such a stretch of the imagination out here stories and news are passed on by word of mouth but stories can get exaggerated each village we pass thinks there are bigger faster boats in the villages further up-river im beginning to doubt it but the next stopover proves to be much more fruitful and finally i get myself a faster boat so who would have thought it some rumours are true they said there were bigger boats faster boats better engines i doubted it but here i go this is going to take me very nearly to where i want to go its becoming more and more like a watery maze than a river i have no idea where the far bank is the chances are its five or ten miles away now so even without all these islands i wouldnt see it and im starting to think about the fishing im used to fishing in rivers and this is more like an inland sea and the big problem im going to encounter is just one of location cos where am i going to find these fish in all this water im just arriving at a riverside town where this boat has to stop and im going to have to get my things off but it looks like theres quite a bit of activity here im hoping i find something maybe a canoe that will take me on to the village where im trying to go this large dug-out will take me the final leg of my journey to the village of bonga this village is ideally situated being at the confluence of two rivers the congo and the sangha from past experience i know that this is just the kind of place where big fish gather to feed on small fish after a journey of nearly miles im back in the region where i saw that massive catfish all those years ago it was also near here that i caught malaria the insect-borne disease that kills millions of africans every year the memories of that time come flooding back as the malarial parasites swarmed through my blood it felt as if a war was raging inside my body i went through two weeks of hell - sweating hallucinations and fever the slightest sound had my head pounding i thought i was going to die now ill have to relive that nightmare as i sit out fishing night after night on the same stretch of river as i arrive at the village of bonga the air is warm thick heavy sluggish this is to be my home for the next few weeks and its where my journey really begins im met by the chief nguema luckily for me he speaks fluent french the language left behind by the european colonisers he explains that he has been chosen from a population of several hundred to lead this community which survives entirely from fishing these waters nguema brings out a covered basin with something moving around in the bottom on closer inspection i glimpse snake-like markings whether ill be successful or not i dont know they speak french - voila - voila thats gosh thats a fish and a half that is thats a mongusu and that looks just like a snakehead but its in africa but its so similar so similar the bony head and a very muscular body and the other thing is theyre capable of living in lots of them in a very small amount of water so theyre very well-adapted to sort of low oxygen conditions id better put it back i think dont want him out too long theres just so many variations on the fish theme here and just a brilliant example of what they call conversion evolution you get fish in a completely different part of the world which have the same strategy for survival and actually look very similar speaks french this does sound like the place for big catfish the biggest hes seen was about nine foot in length but that was a while ago nowadays maybe five or six foot i mean thats still a very big fish nguema has said he will help me in any way he can starting tomorrow with a trip to meet other fishermen so i can get the lie of the river the chief has let me set up camp in an old deserted logging depot the previous inhabitants vanished during the last civil war during the past hundred years or so while much of the world was marching forward the congo has been retreating back into the darkness of a bygone era after such a brutal history it is to be expected that violence breeds violence and i cant help but feel that the people here must harbour feelings of antipathy towards outsiders my sudden appearance last night has surprised many of the villagers but their main concern this morning is the chiefs brother who failed to return from a fishing trip last night there are two main methods of fishing here - drift nets and long lines equipped with multiple hooks both techniques are fraught with danger and the chief takes me to meet fishermen to find out more in my experience this is not only the best way to learn about the fish but you also get to hear stories that normally never make it to the outside world we visit a tiny fishing village to meet nkoi a specialist in big catfish conversation in french what weve got here is a three-stage process you start off with one of those a worm on a little hook and then thats attached to a weight that goes down near the bottom weve got a bit of an old erm bit of an old sandal bit of a flip-flop here you throw those in the river and that gets a little fish called an mbesi its a fish about that big and they are the preferred bait when youve got some of those you then put that alive oh there we go ah ok the line just attached to the mouth there just threaded through and then a big single hook just nicked through the skin there and then the point standing nice and clear so thats actually a very clean but very effective er way of mounting the bait theres another way of fishing which we would call a long line youve got er one main rope and then at intervals youve got hooks coming off and youve got baits on those hooks speaks french what can happen there is that youre bringing that in and youve got some hooks in the boat and if youve got another fish on the line or maybe even a couple of other fish on the line and they start pulling one of the hooks thats in the boat can actually stick in you so potentially this multi-hook method of fishing is is very very dangerous there was one man called mangunda he actually had a hook go through his hand now he luckily survived he cut through the line - forget the fish - cut through the line to avoid getting dragged into the water and to avoid serious injury and they then had to cut the hook to get it out of him but for others the consequences are much more serious at the next fishing village i meet ngomba who tells me about his friend who was dragged from his boat to his death the details of the story appear to be that a fishermen fairly local to here went out one morning as usual to check his lines and he didnt come back speaks french what happened was that two days later somebody found his body and he had one of his hooks through his shirt and actually into the flesh of his arm from the situation of the mans body and the line they were able to deduce that he must have been pulling in the line and then just somehow got the hook caught in him and he was pulled over the side on the same line on another hook was a large catfish the size of the catfish well he indicated that around here that isnt the length of the fish that is actually the width of the head so were talking a fish well over pounds i wonder what the chief thinks about my mission to catch a monster catfish especially in the light of this incident and the disappearance of his brother we head back to the village and join the rest of the fishermen who are heading out to set their hooks for the night ahead nguema takes me along over the coming weeks his help could make the difference between success and failure weve got close to hooks there all baited with er well some with soap some with bits of snail and this is very precarious erm im fairly heavy compared to the people here but weve got er quite a wobbly boat and erm the idea of pulling in a big fish from a boat like this is er is a bit interesting to say the least speaks french the first weight has gone in its about six feet deep something like that it looked like what were gonna do now is put the line out to the middle of the river with the hooks at intervals and then theres a final weight just to hold everything in place you get tension building up in the line you get these hooks just whipping past you as youre paddling out into the middle trying this fishing for myself brings home the reality of that story of the fisherman who had the hook stuck in his leg when he was pulling in some fish the canoe is very unstable your feet are very close to coils of line youve got dozens of hooks in the boat and all it needs is just a slight slip a slight lapse of concentration and youre over the side and the consequences can be fatal just like that the chief is anxious to head back to the village to see if there is any news about his brother then i get the news ive been waiting for a fisherman from the village has caught a decent-sized kamba catfish argh there we go you can hear the fish actually grunting a little bit this is a heavy fish im just i dont know im struggling to hold this up its probably a good pounds i think but its very very stocky im just thinking that head is something like a third of the length of the whole body thats a very big head very big very bony and the mouth is almost you know the entire width of the head there im just imagining youve got one of these on the line and suppose it was to give a sudden surge pull the line out of your hand and then maybe one of the the loose hooks thats in the boat gets caught in you you lose your balance youre over the side once youre in the water and this thing is pulling you actually you know it doesnt need to be a big fish to keep you under the water and when you think about it youve only got what seconds of air in your lungs its power its strength its not inconceivable that a fish even this size could possibly drag somebody to their death conversation in french getting a big fish in a small unstable canoe he says yes that is dangerous hes never been pulled out into the water but he knows other fishermen that has happened to and i make my way to an area of the river that according to the locals holds some of the biggest catfish in this region what ill do ill have the boat here and then ill put two maybe three rods across so i should have quite a good set-up for intercepting anything that might be on the prowl the catfish im after is most active at night when it comes into the shallows using its whiskers to detect prey it is one of the congos top predators im in position nicely before dark which is good and unlike the local fishermen who er go back home go to sleep come out in the morning to check their lines im gonna sit here on the rods er the mosquitoes will be in soon so i shall be buttoning up my shirt putting on some repellent but er once ive done that its just er sit and wait buzzing eventually having sat through wave after wave of mosquitoes im forced to quit and head back to camp the chiefs just come round asking if he can borrow some fuel his brother still isnt back from fishing hes now well overdue so whats going to happen is some people are going to go out and have a look try and find him if that wasnt worrying enough ive just heard from the house next door that you know the way things work here is that theres no such thing as an accident everything has a cause and that because this disappearance comes at the same time as my being here there are people starting to say that i am responsible for this the atmosphere here has changed many of the villagers seem stony-faced i dont know whats going on which worries me superstition is incredibly powerful here and i have no idea what might happen to me if any harm comes to the chiefs brother as i lie waiting to hear news i feel isolated anxious and vulnerable i knew i was heading into the unknown when i set out on this trip but i didnt foresee anything like this happening chanting and singing ive just actually heard commotion down by the side of the water and even without hearing the words i think its good news i think they found him which is just an almighty relief er one thing it does it just shows how this kind of thing happening is not that uncommon but thank goodness this time its had a happy ending the following morning its only when i talk to one of the fishermen that i become aware of the extent of the danger i was in last night if the chiefs brother had not come back some of the villagers were going to stone me to death the rules out here are very different and as we head out to check the lines i try to put the events of last night behind me it is now apparent how fundamental the chief is to my success here not just in helping with the fishing but maybe more importantly in ensuring my safety if anything were to happen to him while hes out with me i dare not consider the consequences and its then we catch a snag its a fish a fish which pulled the line speaks french without a second thought nguema disappears into the murky water and i understand now how different our attitudes to fishing are this is real about feeding his family ive gone into some of the scariest waters in the world but in this situation id be very afraid to leave the safety of this wobbly canoe - speaks french - its very snagged down there very snagged i try to act normal and remain calm but this is exactly the scenario i was dreading he actually got caught on one of the other hooks you know it doesnt bear thinking about if that hook had gone in fully past the barb you know youre just not going to come up its becoming clear to me that the real danger might not be the monster fish but the process of trying to catch them and the desperation of the fishermen to feed their families and mami wata may not be a supernatural being perhaps shes just a cultural invention to soften the reality of a premature watery grave carefully we release the tangled line in case theres a fish still attached its a slow process to get all the hooks in four hooks up no fish so far five hooks no fish all the baits gone six seven another one no fish eight you can see the bits of snail coming up still no fish nine empty hook ten ten hooks on that line no fish we continue on the opposite side of the river retrieving the other lines but the end result is the same every time - nothing to take home after all that work 67 69 73 75 hooks there might be one or two in the boat as well hooks have been out there for dont know hours something like that overnight and not a single fish and im starting to do the maths and think here i am im going to fish with one hook this is equivalent to me sitting by the river for nights thats two and a half months and catching nothing its quite a surprise erm ive seen fish in the markets and you think ah theres loads of fish around but of course those markets theyre collection points for fishermen operating in a wide area and who knows how long ago they were caught catfish can be tethered and kept alive after capture for several weeks its looking like a much much tougher challenge than i thought just catching anything here i recruit other fishermen to help and put out more lines in the water so weve got baits out in different types of places nothing so far i havent caught my trophy fish yet but then many of the villagers havent caught anything at all as well as the big ones they need to catch the small ones and er you know too many days not catching anything thats seriously bad news much worse news than it is for me as one day merges into another i spend the day setting long lines and the nights fishing alone in areas where local methods are not suited but day after day the results are the same and that presents me with a dilemma - because if i were to catch a giant catfish i would normally want to return it unharmed but that would horrify the people who have helped me who scratch a meagre existence from this river after recent events im beginning to understand how intricately intertwined superstition is here with everyday life this has gone from a quest to catch a killer catfish to a matter of survival not just for the villagers but for me too thanks to the power of superstition its been years now such a long journey to get back here but so far for nothing and im almost starting to wonder if the last quarter of a century has maybe even seen an end of the giant catfish of the congo and now the weather seems to be closing in if the rainy season comes early the river could become lethal to fish and the malarial mosquitoes unbearable to be out in unlike the local fishermen im taking anti-malarials but that didnt make any difference last time i was here er i was just bitten so much that you know the parasites just overwhelmed my defences and im thinking now that possibly just going out every night is actually possibly a little bit reckless as i head out again its beginning to dawn on me that the spirit mami wata might not be a fish but a consequence of the local fishing methods but it is said here that the arrival of the rains brings with it the catfish i feel the line waiting to detect the slightest sign of interest from a fish the mosquitoes begin their nightly assault and the river is throwing everything at me i dont know what im going to catch first - a fish or malaria but my set-up is perfect and im not moving this trip is beginning to feel like the most difficult challenge ive ever faced this is another reason for doing things the local way the weathers just so unpredictable this storm came from nowhere and er you know sitting here like this does make you appreciate the sense there is in the way everybody else does their fishing here you know you stay out on the lines like this and either get soaked to the skin or you get destroyed by the mosquitoes as the hours pass i have little to do but bail out the boat and eventually its me that has to bail out thunder rumbles it really does rather seem that everything is just conspiring against me i had such a good set-up there i had a couple of good baits out the boat was positioned nicely and if anything had been in the mood to feed you know i had the perfect ambush set and nicely before dark as well you know the sun went down the darkness closed in - and then a few spots of rain and then - thunder you know this hit the morning is cloaked in blackness an overcast sky from the heart of an immense darkness its not wise to head out alone in these conditions so with no sign of the storm abating the chief comes to get me to help him gather the lines as we head out i think about the fisherman who was dragged to his death by a monster catfish on his line weather like this makes everything more hazardous the rough river releases rafts of debris soap and heavy rain make the boat incredibly slippery washing the hooks and lines around my feet this will put to the test everything i have learned in my short time here again i wonder if the chief is testing me and again i cannot afford to lose face jeremy groans conversation in french the line when its tight its really hard to undo the knot here which can mean its a fish so i need to make sure that once ive untied it ive got a good grip on it - ok - thunder im clambering over the hooks here my hands on the hooks i dont like that but ok im getting absolutely soaked but i dont mind that if thats fish hey its a fish theres a fish theres a fish thunder speaks french the stories ive heard are racing through my head and im thankful to have the chief controlling the boat most fishermen here normally go out alone i thought i felt something else possibly somethings moving down there two fish can mean double the power thats kicking thats kicking got to be got to be careful it doesnt pull this line out and send those other hooks flying fortunately it looks like theyve already lost a lot of their power struggling to get off the lines luckily these fish have probably been on the line for a little while lets get all this line well clear from me i can feel something else pulling i think theres something pulling on the end of this one there is theres a kick definitely ill just get this hook sorted speaks french there we go wow how about this how about this nothing nothing nothing and i think it could have been the rain its quite possible it was the rain that got them going three nice-sized tsuni there the weathers kicking off though - i mean its coming - thunder its getting worse lightning i want to have a look at these fish but the priority should be to get back to the village have a good look at them there my priorities i realise have changed years ago i left the congo feeling cheated for not having caught the big fish i returned determined to settle the score but im leaving feeling humbled by this great river and the people that eke out a meagre existence in this crucible of violence again i didnt catch the big one maybe theyre no longer here but i did discover that the three i caught could be more than capable of pulling a fisherman overboard if youre using the hazardous local methods inside of just being abstract jottings in my notebook you know i came to really understand how those accidents could have happened youre in a narrow wobbly canoe maybe theres waves and wind complicating the situation theres a fish on the end its pulling and you lose your concentration for a moment or happen to slip at the moment that fish makes a lunge youve got a loose hook it flies through the air very easily its in your hand its in your leg youre over the side and actually in that situation even a fish this size youre not gonna have a chance against it this is gonna pull you under you cannot pull against a fish even this size the story of mami wata luring fishermen to their deaths is a fantastical one but one that in the end i could not debunk because the truth is every bit as frightening as the myth for me mami wata does exist not as a spirit but as an entity created by the realities of life here - the need to win food day after day from this hostile and mysterious river,the vundu heterobranchus longifilis is a species of large airbreathing catfish found widely in rivers and other freshwater habitats of sub-saharan africa as well as the nile it is also called the sampa cur lenda or certa description the vundu is the largest true freshwater fish in southern africa reaching up to m ft in length and kg lb in weight bull sharks are also found in southern africa and reach a larger size but occur in both fresh and saltwater few other catfish have such large second dorsal fins adipose fins or such long barbels as do the vundu its barbels nearly reach to the origin of the pelvic fin the colour of heterobranchus longifilis is light to dark olive brown on its dorsal surface getting lighter over the mid-body to a light brown its belly is off-white fins are usually light brown in aquaculture it is sometimes hybridized with another very large species the african sharptooth catfish clarias gariepinus resulting in offspring known as hetero-clarias habitat and range the vundu is found widely in rivers and other freshwater habitats of sub-saharan africa only extending beyond this region in the nile although it is rare in the lower sections of this river among others it is found in the benue river volta river niger river gambia river senegal river lake chad omo river congo river basin lake rukwa lake kariba zambezi river lake tanganyika and lake edward the vundu is generally uncommon but it is not considered threatened despite having declined locally most active at night it feeds on any available food including invertebrates and insects when small then fish and other small vertebrates when large it scavenges off large carcasses and offal from riverside villages it can live for or more years the vundu can survive out of water for extensive periods of time due to impaired vision they rely on vibrations and smells in search of food they love to remain in deep water for eating any available food they need the vundu eating habits affect many aspects of their lives their growth feeding efficiency and body mineral composition if they are raised in captivity and fed a soy based or cotton based meal their growth will reduce significantly changing the vundus diets partially is okay but changing them completely is detrimental to an extent because of the lack of protein they receive in a given meal references further reading toko imorou 2 fiogbe emile d

world so many far-flung locations that i rarely return to the same place twice that is unless ive been defeated the first time but theres one place where ive longed to return a land that beat me before a region of unparalleled brutality where for over a hundred years violence and blood-letting have been a way of life i travelled here years ago but had to pick my time carefully since then continuing violence and unrest have prevented me from going back this is the congo a region lost in the dark heart of africa a land of fables legends and spirits and there is one spirit in particular called mami wata who is said to lure fishermen to the bottom of the river where theyre imprisoned for eternity far-fetched maybe not recently new stories have reached me of fishermen dragged overboard to*****************deaths so im heading back out there to discover if these tales are just fables and legends or if something really is lurking in the depths my name is jeremy wade what keeps me alive is catching fish but some of the moments when ive felt most alive have been those when i was closest to death only by really testing myself do i feel ive achieved anything and to do this i travel far and wide putting my own safety at risk to uncover the truth about what lurks in the worlds rivers im heading to the congo one of the few places on earth that will still really test a fisherman the congo is situated in the*****************heart of africa it is regarded as one of the most violent places on earth my plan is to travel up the congo river into the interior of this vast continent and catch myself a monster this region has enormous mineral wealth but centuries of colonial exploitation and ethnic conflict have been its ruination it now ranks among the poorest and most dangerous places on the planet i first came here to the congo river with my fishing rods years ago i was travelling through a country known then as zaire and this was a country the size of western europe but with almost no infrastructure a really difficult place to travel on top of that the country was*****************a dictatorship and there was a real climate of fear at the time and it was not really a place that outsiders ever came to certainly nobody travelling on their own as i was i was here for two and a half months and i didnt catch a single fish because the country being so vast and the travelling so difficult it just took me all my time to get to the river and then get out again but i did talk to people i spoke to fishermen and i heard some stories stories of fish so huge that they are said sometimes to drag the fishermen out of their dug-out canoes drowning them in the water and then*****************was on my way out i was travelling on a big riverboat - maybe other passengers on that boat - and i actually glimpsed one of these monsters somebody dragged it on board and i took a photograph and the memory of that fish has just stayed with me ever since but recently fresh stories have reached my ears of this place and they have rekindled the memories of that fish that i saw on the boat and theyve reminded me that me and this river have got some unfinished business the people of the congo are very superstitious they believe that this great river is inhabited by the spirit mami wata but could this water spirit actually be*****************rare and massive fish like the one i glimpsed all those years ago i have to find out i get my first real sight of the harshness of life in this place when we stop in a village to refuel life here is cruel and unforgiving just to survive takes incredible strength spirit and resilience merci whats slightly disturbing about this fish is that its still alive catfish tend to stay alive for a long time out of water and if you let yourself be ruled by sentiment youd bash this fish on the head put it out of its misery but if you do that it will go bad very quickly the meat will go rotten and people*****************going to eat it so if you live somewhere like this sentiment goes out the window and you want to keep this thing alive for as long as possible so that it tastes good when you eat it simple as that - kamba its a kamba - kamba this one here this is the kamba this is one of the ones that grows very big its a very thick-bodied catfish its got big eyes the eyes of a predator those arent the eyes of a fish that snuffles around on the bottom its got the er the feelers like all catfish but this mouth this is an active predatory catfish and thats a small version of the animal that*****************after with their scaleless bodies and whisker-like tentacles catfish are incredibly diverse there are an estimated different species inhabiting every continent except antarctica i have caught them in the new world and the old but here the congo is home to over different types thats nearly three times as many as in all the rivers in north america this is the electric catfish ah but here mimics electric buzzing ok ok laughs its got very sharp spines here agh im here to catch a catfish thats rumoured to reach eight feet in length and weigh over pounds - a leviathan among the worlds river monsters the local name for the congo river is nzadi it means the river that*****************notice that little has changed over the last years im using up valuable time and i still have miles ahead of me before i reach the place where i saw that giant fish as yet another day draws to a close im getting desperate to see what fish are in the river but i have no bait that is until the boatman suggests a local favourite soap any old soap will do its not just er your your traditional sort of animal fat-based soap but any antiseptic soap you name it erm the fish will go for it and one good thing about it is it will really give off a good scent trail down the river the catfish here are said to be among the biggest anywhere in the world ive set myself up in a quiet slack on the edge of a current a rivers a bit like*****************conveyor belt if you position yourself in the right place it will bring food this is just the kind of place where everything settles out and where the fish congregate but as the hours pass the only thing thats biting are the mosquitoes clicking line clicks out quickly im pretty sure that was just the current but every now and again you get a real surge but things are very quiet and thats i dont know its quite a surprise line clicks out rapidly fish on thats a fish lay this down i recognise this as one of the giant catfish species but this is just a baby even so he gave me quite an impressive run-around which is*****************bit scary because its said they can grow to over times this size and drag fishermen from their boats i know of catfish in the amazon big enough to swallow people whole so theres no reason why this river couldnt be home to fish of a similar size crucially for me there is virtually no commercial fishing here unlike say the amazon where you have a huge commercial fishing fleet that extracts literally tonnes of fish every day so if theres one river in the world where you might hope to find a real monster lurking undisturbed in the depths this is it this is the end of the line for this boat and as we pull into a*****************fishing village i get my first sight of a congo river monster brief conversation in local language they call them eels im used to eels that are like that round and maybe inches two foot long these things theyre the thickness of your leg and maybe four getting onto five foot ill see if we can maybe get one out and have a proper look at one theyre just such weird-looking creatures im not going to put my hands in the mouth theres some pretty nasty-looking fangs in there they look sharp and they also look quite dirty and er unhygienic i think ive got an id on these i think these are lungfish - hisses - oh that*****************because this fish actually has an air bladder which is used as a lung so it can breathe out of water and this is a fish which can bury itself underground and survive droughts it sort of i think belched out a little bit of air and then that was a inhales deeply took some air in and then belched out of the gills small eyes generally on a fish means they dont use them much for feeding theyre probably using vibration or scent in the water more than vision to find their food this was caught with on a palm nut so it suggests you know an omnivorous feeder that mouth to me looks like its going to*****************fish i guess like a lot of fish round here its opportunistic itll actually chomp anything that comes its way but anyway they call this an eel and you know i have to say its the most impressive eel that ive ever seen lungfish are ancient creatures pre-dating all animals that walk on land when i look at a beast like this mami wata no longer seems such a stretch of the imagination out here stories and news are passed on by word of mouth but stories can get exaggerated each village we pass thinks there are bigger faster boats in the villages further up-river im beginning to doubt it but the next stopover proves to be much more*****************and finally i get myself a faster boat so who would have thought it some rumours are true they said there were bigger boats faster boats better engines i doubted it but here i go this is going to take me very nearly to where i want to go its becoming more and more like a watery maze than a river i have no idea where the far bank is the chances are its five or ten miles away now so even without all these islands i wouldnt see it and im starting to think about the fishing im used to fishing in rivers and this is more like an inland sea and the big problem im going to*****************is just one of location cos where am i going to find these fish in all this water im just arriving at a riverside town where this boat has to stop and im going to have to get my things off but it looks like theres quite a bit of activity here im hoping i find something maybe a canoe that will take me on to the village where im trying to go this large dug-out will take me the final leg of my journey to the village of bonga this village is ideally situated being at the confluence of two rivers the congo and the sangha from past experience i know that this is just the kind of*****************where big fish gather to feed on small fish after a journey of nearly miles im back in the region where i saw that massive catfish all those years ago it was also near here that i caught malaria the insect-borne disease that kills millions of africans every year the memories of that time come flooding back as the malarial parasites swarmed through my blood it felt as if a war was raging inside my body i went through two weeks of hell - sweating hallucinations and fever the slightest sound had my head pounding i thought i was going to die now ill have to relive that nightmare as i sit out fishing night after night on the*****************stretch of river as i arrive at the village of bonga the air is warm thick heavy sluggish this is to be my home for the next few weeks and its where my journey really begins im met by the chief nguema luckily for me he speaks fluent french the language left behind by the european colonisers he explains that he has been chosen from a population of several hundred to lead this community which survives entirely from fishing these waters nguema brings out a covered basin with something moving around in the bottom on closer inspection i glimpse snake-like markings whether ill be successful or not i dont know they speak french - voila - voila thats gosh*****************a fish and a half that is thats a mongusu and that looks just like a snakehead but its in africa but its so similar so similar the bony head and a very muscular body and the other thing is theyre capable of living in lots of them in a very small amount of water so theyre very well-adapted to sort of low oxygen conditions id better put it back i think dont want him out too long theres just so many variations on the fish theme here and just a brilliant example of what they call conversion evolution you get fish in a completely different part of the world which have the same strategy for survival and actually*****************very similar speaks french this does sound like the place for big catfish the biggest hes seen was about nine foot in length but that was a while ago nowadays maybe five or six foot i mean thats still a very big fish nguema has said he will help me in any way he can starting tomorrow with a trip to meet other fishermen so i can get the lie of the river the chief has let me set up camp in an old deserted logging depot the previous inhabitants vanished during the last civil war during the past hundred years or so while much of the world was marching forward the congo has been retreating back into the*****************of a bygone era after such a brutal history it is to be expected that violence breeds violence and i cant help but feel that the people here must harbour feelings of antipathy towards outsiders my sudden appearance last night has surprised many of the villagers but their main concern this morning is the chiefs brother who failed to return from a fishing trip last night there are two main methods of fishing here - drift nets and long lines equipped with multiple hooks both techniques are fraught with danger and the chief takes me to meet fishermen to find out more in my experience this is not only the best way to learn about the fish but you*****************get to hear stories that normally never make it to the outside world we visit a tiny fishing village to meet nkoi a specialist in big catfish conversation in french what weve got here is a three-stage process you start off with one of those a worm on a little hook and then thats attached to a weight that goes down near the bottom weve got a bit of an old erm bit of an old sandal bit of a flip-flop here you throw those in the river and that gets a little fish called an mbesi its a fish about that big and they are the preferred bait when youve got some of those you then put that*****************oh there we go ah ok the line just attached to the mouth there just threaded through and then a big single hook just nicked through the skin there and then the point standing nice and clear so thats actually a very clean but very effective er way of mounting the bait theres another way of fishing which we would call a long line youve got er one main rope and then at intervals youve got hooks coming off and youve got baits on those hooks speaks french what can happen there is that youre bringing that in and youve got some hooks in the boat and if youve got another fish on the line or maybe even a*****************of other fish on the line and they start pulling one of the hooks thats in the boat can actually stick in you so potentially this multi-hook method of fishing is is very very dangerous there was one man called mangunda he actually had a hook go through his hand now he luckily survived he cut through the line - forget the fish - cut through the line to avoid getting dragged into the water and to avoid serious injury and they then had to cut the hook to get it out of him but for others the consequences are much more serious at the next fishing village i meet ngomba who tells me about his friend who was*****************from his boat to his death the details of the story appear to be that a fishermen fairly local to here went out one morning as usual to check his lines and he didnt come back speaks french what happened was that two days later somebody found his body and he had one of his hooks through his shirt and actually into the flesh of his arm from the situation of the mans body and the line they were able to deduce that he must have been pulling in the line and then just somehow got the hook caught in him and he was pulled over the side on the same line on another hook was a large catfish*****************size of the catfish well he indicated that around here that isnt the length of the fish that is actually the width of the head so were talking a fish well over pounds i wonder what the chief thinks about my mission to catch a monster catfish especially in the light of this incident and the disappearance of his brother we head back to the village and join the rest of the fishermen who are heading out to set their hooks for the night ahead nguema takes me along over the coming weeks his help could make the difference between success and failure weve got close to hooks there all baited with er well some with soap some with*****************of snail and this is very precarious erm im fairly heavy compared to the people here but weve got er quite a wobbly boat and erm the idea of pulling in a big fish from a boat like this is er is a bit interesting to say the least speaks french the first weight has gone in its about six feet deep something like that it looked like what were gonna do now is put the line out to the middle of the river with the hooks at intervals and then theres a final weight just to hold everything in place you get tension building up in the line you get these hooks just whipping past you as youre*****************out into the middle trying this fishing for myself brings home the reality of that story of the fisherman who had the hook stuck in his leg when he was pulling in some fish the canoe is very unstable your feet are very close to coils of line youve got dozens of hooks in the boat and all it needs is just a slight slip a slight lapse of concentration and youre over the side and the consequences can be fatal just like that the chief is anxious to head back to the village to see if there is any news about his brother then i get the news ive been waiting for a fisherman from the village has*****************a decent-sized kamba catfish argh there we go you can hear the fish actually grunting a little bit this is a heavy fish im just i dont know im struggling to hold this up its probably a good pounds i think but its very very stocky im just thinking that head is something like a third of the length of the whole body thats a very big head very big very bony and the mouth is almost you know the entire width of the head there im just imagining youve got one of these on the line and suppose it was to give a sudden surge pull the line out of your hand and then maybe one of the*****************loose hooks thats in the boat gets caught in you you lose your balance youre over the side once youre in the water and this thing is pulling you actually you know it doesnt need to be a big fish to keep you under the water and when you think about it youve only got what seconds of air in your lungs its power its strength its not inconceivable that a fish even this size could possibly drag somebody to their death conversation in french getting a big fish in a small unstable canoe he says yes that is dangerous hes never been pulled out into the water but he knows other fishermen that has happened to and i*****************my way to an area of the river that according to the locals holds some of the biggest catfish in this region what ill do ill have the boat here and then ill put two maybe three rods across so i should have quite a good set-up for intercepting anything that might be on the prowl the catfish im after is most active at night when it comes into the shallows using its whiskers to detect prey it is one of the congos top predators im in position nicely before dark which is good and unlike the local fishermen who er go back home go to sleep come out in the morning to check their lines im gonna sit*****************on the rods er the mosquitoes will be in soon so i shall be buttoning up my shirt putting on some repellent but er once ive done that its just er sit and wait buzzing eventually having sat through wave after wave of mosquitoes im forced to quit and head back to camp the chiefs just come round asking if he can borrow some fuel his brother still isnt back from fishing hes now well overdue so whats going to happen is some people are going to go out and have a look try and find him if that wasnt worrying enough ive just heard from the house next door that you know the way things work here is*****************isolated anxious and vulnerable i knew i was heading into the unknown when i set out on this trip but i didnt foresee anything like this happening chanting and singing ive just actually heard commotion down by the side of the water and even without hearing the words i think its good news i think they found him which is just an almighty relief er one thing it does it just shows how this kind of thing happening is not that uncommon but thank goodness this time its had a happy ending the following morning its only when i talk to one of the fishermen that i become aware of the extent of the danger i was in last night if the chiefs brother had not come back some of the villagers were going to stone me to death the rules out here are very different and as we head*****************to check the lines i try to put the events of last night behind me it is now apparent how fundamental the chief is to my success here not just in helping with the fishing but maybe more importantly in ensuring my safety if anything were to happen to him while hes out with me i dare not consider the consequences and its then we catch a snag its a fish a fish which pulled the line speaks french without a second thought nguema disappears into the murky water and i understand now how different our attitudes to fishing are this is real about feeding his family ive gone into some of the scariest waters in the world but*****************this situation id be very afraid to leave the safety of this wobbly canoe - speaks french - its very snagged down there very snagged i try to act normal and remain calm but this is exactly the scenario i was dreading he actually got caught on one of the other hooks you know it doesnt bear thinking about if that hook had gone in fully past the barb you know youre just not going to come up its becoming clear to me that the real danger might not be the monster fish but the process of trying to catch them and the desperation of the fishermen to feed their families and mami wata may not be a supernatural*****************perhaps shes just a cultural invention to soften the reality of a premature watery grave carefully we release the tangled line in case theres a fish still attached its a slow process to get all the hooks in four hooks up no fish so far five hooks no fish all the baits gone six seven another one no fish eight you can see the bits of snail coming up still no fish nine empty hook ten ten hooks on that line no fish we continue on the opposite side of the river retrieving the other lines but the end result is the same every time - nothing to take home after all that work 69 75 hooks there might*****************one or two in the boat as well hooks have been out there for dont know hours something like that overnight and not a single fish and im starting to do the maths and think here i am im going to fish with one hook this is equivalent to me sitting by the river for nights thats two and a half months and catching nothing its quite a surprise erm ive seen fish in the markets and you think ah theres loads of fish around but of course those markets theyre collection points for fishermen operating in a wide area and who knows how long ago they were caught catfish can be tethered and kept alive after capture for*****************weeks its looking like a much much tougher challenge than i thought just catching anything here i recruit other fishermen to help and put out more lines in the water so weve got baits out in different types of places nothing so far i havent caught my trophy fish yet but then many of the villagers havent caught anything at all as well as the big ones they need to catch the small ones and er you know too many days not catching anything thats seriously bad news much worse news than it is for me as one day merges into another i spend the day setting long lines and the nights fishing alone in areas where local methods*****************not suited but day after day the results are the same and that presents me with a dilemma - because if i were to catch a giant catfish i would normally want to return it unharmed but that would horrify the people who have helped me who scratch a meagre existence from this river after recent events im beginning to understand how intricately intertwined superstition is here with everyday life this has gone from a quest to catch a killer catfish to a matter of survival not just for the villagers but for me too thanks to the power of superstition its been years now such a long journey to get back here but so far for nothing and*****************almost starting to wonder if the last quarter of a century has maybe even seen an end of the giant catfish of the congo and now the weather seems to be closing in if the rainy season comes early the river could become lethal to fish and the malarial mosquitoes unbearable to be out in unlike the local fishermen im taking anti-malarials but that didnt make any difference last time i was here er i was just bitten so much that you know the parasites just overwhelmed my defences and im thinking now that possibly just going out every night is actually possibly a little bit reckless as i head out again its beginning to dawn on me that*****************spirit mami wata might not be a fish but a consequence of the local fishing methods but it is said here that the arrival of the rains brings with it the catfish i feel the line waiting to detect the slightest sign of interest from a fish the mosquitoes begin their nightly assault and the river is throwing everything at me i dont know what im going to catch first - a fish or malaria but my set-up is perfect and im not moving this trip is beginning to feel like the most difficult challenge ive ever faced this is another reason for doing things the local way the weathers just so unpredictable this storm came from nowhere and*****************you know sitting here like this does make you appreciate the sense there is in the way everybody else does their fishing here you know you stay out on the lines like this and either get soaked to the skin or you get destroyed by the mosquitoes as the hours pass i have little to do but bail out the boat and eventually its me that has to bail out thunder rumbles it really does rather seem that everything is just conspiring against me i had such a good set-up there i had a couple of good baits out the boat was positioned nicely and if anything had been in the mood to feed you know i had the*****************ambush set and nicely before dark as well you know the sun went down the darkness closed in - and then a few spots of rain and then - thunder you know this hit the morning is cloaked in blackness an overcast sky from the heart of an immense darkness its not wise to head out alone in these conditions so with no sign of the storm abating the chief comes to get me to help him gather the lines as we head out i think about the fisherman who was dragged to his death by a monster catfish on his line weather like this makes everything more hazardous the rough river releases rafts of debris soap and heavy*****************make the boat incredibly slippery washing the hooks and lines around my feet this will put to the test everything i have learned in my short time here again i wonder if the chief is testing me and again i cannot afford to lose face jeremy groans conversation in french the line when its tight its really hard to undo the knot here which can mean its a fish so i need to make sure that once ive untied it ive got a good grip on it - ok - thunder im clambering over the hooks here my hands on the hooks i dont like that but ok im getting absolutely soaked but i dont mind that if thats*****************hey its a fish theres a fish theres a fish thunder speaks french the stories ive heard are racing through my head and im thankful to have the chief controlling the boat most fishermen here normally go out alone i thought i felt something else possibly somethings moving down there two fish can mean double the power thats kicking thats kicking got to be got to be careful it doesnt pull this line out and send those other hooks flying fortunately it looks like theyve already lost a lot of their power struggling to get off the lines luckily these fish have probably been on the line for a little while lets get all this line well clear from*****************i can feel something else pulling i think theres something pulling on the end of this one there is theres a kick definitely ill just get this hook sorted speaks french there we go wow how about this how about this nothing nothing nothing and i think it could have been the rain its quite possible it was the rain that got them going three nice-sized tsuni there the weathers kicking off though - i mean its coming - thunder its getting worse lightning i want to have a look at these fish but the priority should be to get back to the village have a good look at them there my priorities i realise have changed years ago*****************left the congo feeling cheated for not having caught the big fish i returned determined to settle the score but im leaving feeling humbled by this great river and the people that eke out a meagre existence in this crucible of violence again i didnt catch the big one maybe theyre no longer here but i did discover that the three i caught could be more than capable of pulling a fisherman overboard if youre using the hazardous local methods inside of just being abstract jottings in my notebook you know i came to really understand how those accidents could have happened youre in a narrow wobbly canoe maybe theres waves and wind complicating the situation theres a fish*****************the end its pulling and you lose your concentration for a moment or happen to slip at the moment that fish makes a lunge youve got a loose hook it flies through the air very easily its in your hand its in your leg youre over the side and actually in that situation even a fish this size youre not gonna have a chance against it this is gonna pull you under you cannot pull against a fish even this size the story of mami wata luring fishermen to their deaths is a fantastical one but one that in the end i could not debunk because the truth is every bit as frightening as the myth for me mami,the vundu heterobranchus longifilis is a species of large airbreathing catfish found widely in rivers and other freshwater habitats of sub-saharan africa as well as

alaskan horror,white sturgeon,sinosturio transmontanus,im jeremy wade biologist and extreme angler in search of freshwater monsters i normally track down these beasts in the tropics ive never searched for one in the subarctic before on these lakes deep in the alaskan wilderness people have been going missing without trace for as long as anyone can remember there are native myths of a monster thats killing them people just disappeared out of their boats whatever it was they were afraid it would come up and swallow em it has no fear of taking on boats and their propellers there have been many strange sightings as well he said he could see on the surface of the water a large octopus he judged the length of the arms to be near feet im going to investigate whether there really is a deadly monster from the deep killing all these people its quite possible this is the biggest fish ive ever had on the end of my line one of my obsessions is tracking down freshwater monsters throughout the worlds rivers but a story of one monster in an alaskan lake particularly caught my imagination there are many myths of lake monsters all around the world from places such as loch ness in scotland and lake tianchi in china no ones sure these creatures have actually been seen but this monster in lake clark in iliamna is different since the 1940s bush pilots have been flying over this remote area and sightings seem to be getting more and more frequent there are reports of it being up to feet long what are these mysterious shapes in the water are they causing people to drown and disappear into the depths without leaving a trace people have tried to prove its existence for many years years ago there was even a reward put on its head thats half a million in todays money this kind of bounty attracted many monster hunters from serious fishermen to someone who tried to lure it out of the water by playing music all these attempts failed and eventually the reward was withdrawn with still no hard proof it would be easy to dismiss this monster as pure fantasy but i believe these stories must have come from somewhere and there is something down there in the depths this is my first trip to alaska and my journey starts by going deep into its wilderness i normally fish in the tropics and im out of my element in a land of bottomless icy lakes jagged mountains and arctic tundra as a proportion of its population more people go missing in this forbidding landscape than in any other state in the us the best way into this isolated area is by plane threading your way through narrow mountain passes where conditions can deteriorate in a moment there are many legends of this monster but between the smoke of the clouds and the mirrors of the lakes could it actually exist my investigation to find out will focus on two connected bodies of water lake clark and lake iliamna which together cover an area of over square miles - roughly the size of rhode island the larger of the two lake iliamna is miles long and miles wide making it the largest freshwater lake in alaska both lakes reach staggering depths of up to feet with such a vast area of water ive probably got more chance of winning the lottery than catching this monster on my own the best way to start my search is to gain some local knowledge quite a few communities are dotted around the lakes these are the people who will have been here for generations and thesell be the people who have the stories about the monster the people i want to talk to people have lived on this land for more than years and for centuries theyve fished these lakes wearing lightweight waterproof parkas made from seal gut these isolated communities have a strong ancestral tradition of myths and legends including the lake monster im meeting up with the hill family who are athabaskan native alaskans they have a fishing camp on the northern shore of lake iliamna if you look at the shape of iliamna lake on the map it has a shape of a fish theres a large head tapering down to - a tail - a tail and the legend is thats how this lake was formed it was this huge fish that was trapped by the mountains and when a fish is dying or iaying on its side it flops and kind of makes a hole some people say even the name iliamna means a great black fish could this be biting holes in peoples boats people just wouldnt paint their boats a certain colour and you didnt wanna paint the bottom of the boat red i guess there was some connection between painting the bottom of a boat red and it disappearing the red couldve attracted the predatory monster thinking it was blood from some injured prey these legends of the monster are clearly ingrained within local culture the problem with oral history is it can be very hard to pin down exactly when something happened if you take one generation to be roughly years then just four tellings of a story can span years so going back from today just generations takes us back years the time when columbus was arriving in america and look at this you only need to go back just generations to take you back years thats the time when william the conqueror was invading britain the problem with stories passed from one generation to the next is theyre not like newspapers - they dont have a date so something that you hear it couldve happened years ago or maybe it happened just last week is there really still something down there or are they talking about an animal that died a long long time ago i need to find stories of the monster that are still within living memory and ive found one on lake clark pilot and town mayor glen alsworth senior recalls what happened to an aircraft mechanic in the late 1940s a gentleman working for us was trying to catch these large lake trout but he kept having them break the line and so being an aircraft mechanic he got some aircraft cable which is very very strong so on his normal lake trout tackle he was getting broken off several times - so thats when he put the cable down there - he kept getting broken off the mechanic then fashioned his own hook and fixed it to the end of the cable this was then tied to a washed up tree stump he knew that he had a line there that fish would not break and so he decided whatever kind of monster was busting off his line that wasnt gonna happen to him again confident that hed get his fish this time he left and planned to come back the next morning a neighbour that lived by the river observed that stump passing by against the wind and the lake was very rough and the gentleman that observed this was very surprised how could this tree stump be moving against the water against the wind and the waves that is one of the most amazing fishing stories ive heard because from what you describe about the stump it sounds like a few men would struggle to shift it and something in the water has just ripped it out of the bank dragged it across the lake and to this day nobody knows what it was and you know it could still be down there somewhere thats quite a thought glen has told me the exact spot where the stump weighing nearly pounds was ripped from the shore and dragged into the water im going to see what i can catch at this location ive brought a tent ive brought my rod and im going to be throwing a bait into this very same area of the lake ive got some pretty thick cable with me this is probably about this is about 250-pound breaking strain the thing about the stump is there was no no give anywhere in the system so thats why it got ripped out but if you can actually let the fish have some line this fished correctly stands more chance than a bit of aircraft cable tied to a stump this is not the kind of rod youd normally see being used in freshwater this is sort of a marine big game rod it would normally be put to use pulling in shark marlin tuna - that kind of thing but everything ive heard about this place theres stuff in here every bit as big as those animals a fish the size of what ive been hearing could actually sink a boat if youre attached attached to it on a line you know if that line jams so i will be carrying a knife because the worst case scenario is something sounding heading towards the bottom the line getting jammed and id rather lose the fish than lose my life theres a steep drop-off thats further than i can cast the heavy line so im using a kayak to get my bait to a spot where a giant might hide im actually glad im only about yards out into this lake not miles i can really see how this lake just takes on a totally different character once youre actually out on it in a small boat something that could drag a tree stump into the lake could easily knock a small boat over the water in these lakes is only degrees if i was tossed into the water here my body would seize up and id drown in these icy waters bodies sink rather than float and at depths of up to feet mine might never be found with the bait out the plan is to leave it lying on the bottom overnight and see if i can tempt the monster onto my line its just a waiting game now its getting close to night but during the alaskan summer it never gets completely dark its actually very strange being up in the alaskan night because its well after midnight now and i can see the far bank i can see the horizon there i can see the mist over the mountains its a very sort of strange other-worldly place the bait has been in the water for over hours if the monster was nearby and hungry it wouldve taken it by now theres nothing there the baits still there when the weather comes in the lakes are covered in an eerie fog i heard this story about something coming again and again for fish in the water and er i went there and offered a prime piece of fish and just nothing doing at all the stories ive heard from the alaskan natives shroud these lakes in myths and legends such as if you see the monster a tragedy will soon befall your family in conditions like these the brain becomes very suggestible and its easy for your mind to play tricks on you i actually thought i saw something back there and i did a real double-take but i think it was just the dark long face of a wave and i can really imagine how if youre out here any amount of time youre gonna see things even if theres nothing there this place has a special atmosphere but im a rationalist ive got to stay detached and not let my imagination get in the way to move this investigation on i need to find out if people have actually come into contact with the monster hello bill im meeting up with bill trefon who is alaskan native denaina his family has been living on lake clark for generations i heard that your parents had an encounter with some large unknown creature in the lake a while ago what did they think it was and there are pike in the lake big pike in the lake did your mother have any idea how big it might have been feet going back generations people say that if you actually see one of these big fish its like a bad sign tragedies like bills father drowning only help to strengthen the legends surrounding the monster but this story has given me some vital information as to what it could be attacking a propeller suggests it is a sight predator its not some deep water scavenger but its active on the surface this all fits with it being a pike which is what bills mother thought she saw to see if the pike here really can reach such a monstrous size i have to catch one this is chilitma bay near where the boat was attacked and where locals say the biggest pike are ive come across pike in warm water before but ive no idea how big they can grow in these glacial conditions a pike has hundreds of needle-sharp teeth that can cause serious damage to whatever gets into its mouth including humans im using here an imitation frog and ive got this little clip here which goes under the hook and the idea of that is it brushes off any weed so i can chuck this right into the middle of the weed and twitch it and so the legs actually kick as i twitch the tip agh whoa went for it but i was a little bit over-excited there and that was right in the weeds im very impressed by the er the aggression of the fish that had a go at the frog that was only a small fish if that had been a bigger one thered have been an almighty splash but er i think a lot of people who dont fish are very surprised you see a placid bit of water like this and you throw something small in the water and theyll just launch themselves at what they think is a piece of food oh no oh yes theres a fish on theres a fish on its a very gentle take and its a pike its not a very big one whoa jumping look at that that thing jumped out of the water a couple of foot ooh hes gone ok managed to throw the hook but anyway there are pike in here so ive had a pike on the end of my line that was very exciting it jumped clean out of the water glen alsworth junior has seen many times how voracious the pike around here can be - youve seen them take birds - yeah yeah ive seen em take birds ive seen em take baby and adult ducks i saw one eat a muskrat once in this river pretty much anything they can fit their mouth around its not even tempting to get your hand in there when releasing one two weeks ago i had uh releasing one by the tail it turned and did a a small 30-inch pike and it took a bite out of my hand as i was releasing it and so after it bit a hook already then it came for my hand after that even if it wouldve been a 40-inch fish it probably wouldve took done some damage to my tendons and my fingers if a four or five-foot pike can eat water fowl and mammals it seems logical that a 12-footer could be a man eater so what ive got here is a lure that sends out very strong signals its a very bright flash and a very strong vibrating throb that was probably what happened when that fish went for that propeller fish on fish on fish on oh its a nice size fish its a nice size fish here we go thats a nice fish hes going under the boat i dont want him to go the other side look at that lovely fish lovely clear water so you can see the fish really well a lovely alaskan pike just do a quick measure here inches lovely fish a 40-inch pike is probably around years old the thing about a pike if theres ever a fish where the way it looks tells you about the way it lives that is the pike you know head full of teeth at one end not just on the jaws but on the tongue on the gill rake as well and they have eyes that make them a deadly sight predator you can really see here these sighting grooves sort of converging on the prey here so a bit like sighting grooves on a on a rifle and they can just judge the distance to the prey and theyre so wonderfully camouflaged blending into weed very long streamlined shape and then youve got the dorsal fin right at the back so youve got a big propulsion unit as soon as that prey comes within range it lunges and once its in those teeth theres no getting away so just a perfect predator this fish there she goes ive seen that pike can certainly be aggressive theyll hit a piece of vibrating flashing metal on the end of a line i suppose that once in a while they might possibly hit a boat propeller the thing thats bothering me is that bills mother talked about seeing something that was foot long and pike just dont get that big theyd be really pushed to reach even half that length and at that size theyre not gonna be knocking anybody out of a boat and they dont pose a threat to anybody in the water so im doubtful that what bills parents encountered was a pike but i do believe that what they encountered could have been the lake monster but what is there in the water that can reach that kind of size something monstrous could have come in from the sea into lake iliamna connecting the two is the kvichak river which is miles long just seen some dark specks on a tiny island down there hauled out on some gravel those are freshwater seals this is one of very very few places in the world where you have seals in freshwater it brings home the fact that although we call this expanse of water a lake its huge - and if seals have managed to get in here from the ocean it makes you wonder what else might have got in as well salmon sharks a close relative of the great white have been seen in the area but they cant live in freshwater so that has to rule them out but there is one animal around alaskas shores thats big enough to be the monster and can survive in freshwater beluga whales are big enough to be the monster and can live in both salt and freshwater could they have swum up the kvichak river into lake iliamna the shallowest part of the river is the braids a labyrinthine area of channels and theyd have to swim through here to get into the lake my pilot glen alsworth junior knows the area well this looks like about what er five or six miles - something like that - yeah theres about five miles where its braided this way and the deeper channels of course you can see the darker blue water where the deeper channels are and the lighter brown where theres more silt deposit this water here there looks to be some pretty good channels through i think er youve certainly got eight or nine foot in places it might come up to two or three here and there but apparently people navigate these waterways with prop boats without chewing up their propellers so it looks as if theres enough water for belugas to get up into the lake the thing about belugas is that they are mammals they breathe air so they have to surface regularly in that case even with the sparse human population round the lake the sightings would be much more common than they have been whatever the monster is its something that stays submerged and hidden for long periods of time on top of that the people here know what belugas look like if the lake monster was a beluga frankly it wouldnt be a mystery im drawing a bit of a blank with suspects so far so im going to come at this from a different angle ill investigate the monsters potential food source legends of the famous loch ness monster have been dismissed by some because there isnt enough food in the lake to support an animal of that size is there enough food in lake iliamna to feed a monster there is one event each year in these waters that could be what im looking for every july there is the worlds largest run of sockeye salmon im normally busy catching river monsters in the warmest parts of the world and fishing for salmon is totally new to me the temperatures have affected things a little bit so the run is the timing is a little bit off from normal years but it should be a good place to have the salmon start packing in with all this water and the unpredictable nature of the salmon run it can actually be quite hard to find the salmon but one very good way to find them is to look for bears because thats the only reason theyre by the water - to feed on the salmon and actually weve just spotted our first bear so were going to er come in and have a closer look here this is bear country and they depend on the salmon run for food - so ill be in direct competition with them for the best fishing spots were only about miles from where self-styled grizzly expert timothy treadwell and his girlfriend were eaten alive by a hungry grizzly is this the place where we saw the bear from the plane yes you can see a very regular bear trail where theyre coming and going from the river if a bear comes close to us well stand side by side and try to look big like they do then typically theyll just move around you and then move off if a bears trying to fish in an area though the last thing we wanna do is for that bear to think that we want the fishing hole and we expect it to move so if they want it well let em have it carrying a gun at all times is common practice in the alaskan wilderness and in case a bear does attack my pilot glen alsworth junior is carrying a 50-calibre handgun the bears may have already found a good fishing spot just literally feet from where im standing theres been a steady procession of fish through working their way upstream and theres also some big dark groups holding further down so im looking forward to getting a line in the water there are no bears in sight so it seems safe to try and catch my first salmon when sockeye salmon come out of the sea and enter freshwater the males undergo a monstrous transformation they develop a hooked jaw and grow teeth to defend their spawning grounds not only that both the males and females turn red and stop feeding so they wont go for any bait or fly what youre doing is youre casting out youve got a lump of lead here and you flick it degrees upstream it comes down and the fish are all facing upstream and the idea is theyve got their mouths open like this and it gets in their mouth that panics them they run and as they run that ends up in the mouth so it feels like a strike and that will be in the mouth probably like that but theyre not actually going for it thats the theory lets see time to try and get my first salmon there you go you got it agh hes off i actually hooked one that was a bit of a surprise the line just was ticking down and they havent spooked off too far just ticking down it just stopped and i was a bit too surprised i pulled i shouldve tried to set the hook a bit more on that one with this many salmon around its not long before the bears return to their fishing spot heres a bear just coming out of the brush on the far side whereabouts is it glen hes just looking out of the brush watching for salmon oh yeah thats a very definite fishermans posture isnt it you can tell hes ready to pounce down in the water within minutes three large grizzlies have surrounded us our day on the river has suddenly become dangerous this is typical you find a good spot somebody else comes in tries to elbow you out though in this case im going to make a graceful retreat he may turn back theres fish between us and the bear definitely a good time to keep talking keep making noise that way if he has his nose under the water he can still hear us and doesnt end up popping out of the water close to us and having to make a decision about how hes gonna react with the bears this close i can pick up some fishing tips i think he needs a bit of practice its almost on a level with my early fly-fishing attempts they wait till theres a bunch of fish congregated underneath them and then just jump on top of them that way cos i guess a bit like a human fisherman if theres lots of fish even if youre a bit inept youre still going to youre still gonna get something once theyve moved off a bit i can carry on trying to catch my first salmon but these grizzlies are putting me to shame agh fantastic to see these bears close up i wasnt expecting that you can see theyre semi-aquatic i dont think this is the lake monster but you could call it in some ways a bit of a river monster ah here we go believe it or not this is the first salmon ive ever had on the end of my line this is a fish that can swim hundreds of miles up these fast-flowing rivers to get to its spawning grounds so it can put up a strong fight fish has done me a favour its turned off the main flow im so engrossed with catching a salmon i dont notice our interested onlooker out of the water out of the water ok ok right i think were gonna want to break the fish off claps noisily shouting and clapping does he want the fish this bear is clearly not afraid of us and thats a problem shall we just break it off shouting im just gonna break the fish off this is a young grizzly but although not fully grown it could still attack and kill any one of us you can have the fish luckily its more interested in the salmon than us it took my fish and a minute later its back for more this time we need to fire a warning shot im gonna fire one - hes getting too pushy - shouts - no - you guys plug your ears - gunshot - just deep breaths just calm down its all all part of the er the day in the life of a fisherman in this part of the world even after a warning shot the bear wont leave so its best that my film crew and i get out i didnt quite succeed in landing my first salmon but its clear that they are a vital food source to the whole area with millions of salmon coming in every year and fish like pike in these waters year round im convinced that there is enough food to sustain the monster ive been hearing about back on the trail of the monster my investigation has taken a leap forward this could be the breakthrough ive needed im meeting up with robyn levine who saw the monster last year while coming in to land on lake iliamna hello lovely place to work robyn is an anthropologist who works on these lakes studying subsistence fishing by the alaska native people and it was round here you saw the monster as well i gather yes the iliamna lake monster shes trained to observe things accurately so has a clear description of what she saw robyn is going to show me exactly where she saw the monster from the air theres the drop-off yeah you see the clear shallow right over there - yeah - um thats where we saw it right there it was over on that very clear patch oh really we probably had a good to seconds maybe longer to see it initially i thought it was a seal but almost immediately after that thought crossed my mind i realised it was far too big and it moved differently it had a long broad head blunted nose there were very distinct pectoral fins fins on the side of the fish what about the size of this as we were pulling into the bay where we were landing and my friend was coming to pick us up in his boat i estimated that what we saw was about the same size as his boat and thats to feet long feet is the same size as three of me end to end and much bigger than what bills mother saw attacking her boat it looked so normal ive seen beluga from the air ive seen seals from the air it looked a part of the natural environment and i was sure there was some obvious explanation for what we saw this is the breakthrough i needed a graphic description of its shape from somebody who saw it recently and who observed it clearly for some time and from her description the thing that struck me most was how much she emphasised its fins now on a normal fish seen from above like salmon you dont see the fins because theyre tucked in or folded away but there are certain fish where particularly the pectoral fins behind the head really stick out a bit like wings almost this is a crucial bit of the description and i now really do think i have my prime suspect ive now got a strong suspicion that the monster ive been looking for is a white sturgeon its a living dinosaur that has changed very little over million years their range is all along the west coast of north america from mid-california all the way up to alaska they can survive in both salt and freshwater and ive also seen how the river that connects lake iliamna to the sea is easily deep enough for them to swim up even though theyre bottom feeders they have an interesting behaviour they can jump out of the water in recent years a relative of theirs the gulf sturgeon has been seriously injuring people in florida could jumping white sturgeon in lake iliamna and lake clark be the basis of the myths of fishermen going missing could they be causing people to disappear knocking them out of their boats and into the freezing water to prove my case i need to get my hands on a big sturgeon however what were talking about here is an absolutely immense body of water where nobody has ever caught one and where the sightings are less than once a year so to get one on the end of a line if i had years i might be in with half a chance but realistically its just not gonna happen here my challenge has always been to catch this monster and by hook or by crook im going to get one with the odds stacked against me here im leaving alaska and going down to the coiumbia river on the oregonwashington border here they have a large population of white sturgeon and ill have a much better chance of catching one this will be another first for me ive never caught a white sturgeon and i hear they can put up an incredible fight this line although its very fine is actually er it actually has a breaking strain of pounds its braided line the thing about this is its nice and supple so er its not going to drag a lot in the water but another thing about it is its got no stretch virtually no stretch compared to nylon monofilament normal fishing line what that means is if i hook a big fish with this i havent got that elasticity of the line im gonna feel everything very very directly up here so its gonna be quite a physical um struggle with the fish on this gear so just one final detail what were using here is a barbless hook theres no barb on there thats very much about just looking after the fish we need to go quick were on the backing were on the backing im going to drop this bait into about feet of water there we go its fully rigged i think its still sinking thats going down in about foot of water and its bumped the bottom bring it in there thats fine any time now something could take that one very obvious difference between here and lake iliamna is that here youve got a current - the water is moving whereas in a lake in still water the bait sits there and the scent diffuses out very slowly there can be fish not very far away maybe not aware that its there but er moving water here that bait is really advertising itself down the current oh thats a bit of a knock again there bit of a knock somethings definitely interested in it its at that point where all your imaginings about whats under the water they are well theyre starting to take shape whatever it is is on the end of that line but that line is so fine the water heres pretty deep foot or so im attached to something thats a there it is there it is there it is there it is my first white sturgeon and the animal i think can easily grow to become a lake monster its a bit of a tug of war this i just bring it up and then hook out while taking the hook out my chance to finally see the monster up close eludes me that was a very very brief contact with the animal there i was leaning over the side i couldnt reach as far as i wanted the sturgeon are clearly here and that one was about five feet long but i want a larger one white sturgeon can grow to about feet its not long before i get my next bite and this one feels much bigger this fish could be bigger than i am when the fish wants to go im letting it go but im letting it go under pressure its having to work for the line it takes away and then when the fish takes a bit of a breather im hoping you know in those little gaps that i can gain a wee bit of line i think we might have to it might be an idea to cast off i think it might help if we cast off are we going are we on our way this is a long long run were running out of line here were running out of line we need to go quick were on the backing were on the backing wait a minute thats the end of my line there off the reel i wanna get the proper line back on the reel right there we are weve got the line back on the reel that was hairy i was watching my line going that lines coming up on the water theres the fish theres the fish there it is there we go there we go there we go there we go agh ive seen the fish now that is certainly a big fish its taken me half an hour to bring this sturgeon in knowing that this is only around half the length they can grow to i now totally believe that a larger one could drag a tree stump into the water that was a tiring fight ive caught some big fish in freshwater this is probably the biggest freshwater fish ive caught er about pounds this one so you know a real monstrous fish another thing thats very notable about this fish is that its got very small eyes for such a large animal i think what that tells you is vision doesnt play a very big part in its world finding its way around and also finding food and if you look a bit closer at the head you see those four feelers hanging down near the mouth thats how it tastes the water how it found the bait the scent trail coming down the current led it to my bait also interesting theres such amazing patterning all over the fish but here on the snout youve got these vibration sensors the kind of thing that most fish have down the lateral line to pick up any vibrations in the water which could tell them where prey is its just like if youre a human being its just a sense were not used to just feeling vibrations but very very apparent there that a fish like this lives in a different world perceives its world differently down there in the dark water foot down in terms of its difference from other fish and in terms of its size this really is a remarkable creature thats actually or even inches thats eight foot inches nearly nine foot nearly nine foot this fish its quite a thought thats one and a half times me at nine feet this fish is roughly years old but they can live to over this looks big in the water but these things grow to foot possibly even more imagine seeing that in the water you could be forgiven for saying that was a monster up to feet long matches all the descriptions of the monster including robyns plus the pectoral fins and the long streamlined body fit how she described what she saw but what about the teeth marks on the propeller just take a look at the mouth although you could say its predatory - its eaten quite a large dead fish - but theres no teeth in there at all i can put my hands in there its almost its very telescopic you can imagine that extending and literally sucking in a small fish having only gums means it couldnt have been teeth marks on the propeller but i think i know what caused them whats interesting about a sturgeon it hasnt got a bony skeleton the way most fish have - its just got cartilage but what it has got is bony plates on the outside of the body not totally covering it but just in rows these are some form of protection they are quite tough bits of bone and also a very bony head a very bony gill flap as well i believe bill trefons parents actually ran over a white sturgeon and the propeller going over its bony plates caused what looked like teeth marks it may not have any teeth but this mouth is perfectly formed for being a bottom feeder eating molluscs and small fish this explains why it is so rarely seen on lake iliamna or lake clark because it spends most of its time in up to feet of water on the rare occasions when they do come to the surface this could be what is causing some people to disappear their jumping nobody knows why they jump out of the water maybe its a panic reaction to being disturbed but when they do an airborne giant could easily knock somebody out of their boat and into the icy depths this all makes me convinced that the alaskan lake monster is actually a small landlocked population of white sturgeon but so impressive just to get close to an animal like that to touch it and look at it close up and i really think that for a few moments there i was actually in the presence of the creature that is the lake monster,white sturgeon sinosturio transmontanus is a species of sturgeon in the family acipenseridae of the order acipenseriformes they are an anadromous migratory fish species ranging in the eastern pacific from the gulf of alaska to monterey california however some are landlocked in british columbia the fraser river and columbia river drainage montana and lake shasta in california with reported sightings in northern baja california mexico taxonomy prior to it was placed in the genus acipenser however this placement was long known to be paraphyletic in it was moved to the revived genus sinosturio description s transmontanus is distinguished by the two rows of four to eight ganoid bony plates between the anus and anal fin with about rays present in the dorsal fin coloring can range from gray to brownish on the dorsal side paler on the ventral side and gray fins barbels are situated anterior to the mouth closer to the snout than the mouth at sexual maturity s transmontanus can reach m ft in length while the maximum length recorded of any age class is m ft with common lengths around m ft while age at maturity is uncertain possible age ranges of known s transmontanus specimens range from to years old the most authentic record of the maximum weight of this species is reported to be kg lb while other unauthenticated records show a higher weight estimate as with the kg lb estimate for an individual with a reported age of years in one study a sample of adults weighed from to kg to lb a specimen considered the largest in the state in recent years of kg lb at a length of m ft was recorded relatively recently in california taxonomy alternate common names include pacific sturgeon oregon sturgeon columbia sturgeon snake river sturgeon and sacramento sturgeon the specific name is derived from the latin words trans over or beyond and montanus mountain the white sturgeon is part of a pacific clade of species including kaluga sinosturio dauricus sakhalin sinosturio mikadoi green sinosturio medirostris chinese sinosturio sinensis and amur sinosturio schrenkii sturgeon recent genetic analysis supports a close relationship between s transmontanus and s schrenckii which is only found in asia showing a common ancestor between the two around million years ago using microsatellites genetic differentiation between different river systems in the pacific northwest and california is high enough to be able to distinguish between white sturgeon populations and validate a structure in which watershed s transmontanus resides in extant sturgeon species are polyploid containing more than two paired sets of chromosomes derived from an extinct ancestor containing chromosomes genome duplication during sturgeon evolution has led to three different groups of species with 240 and chromosomes recent study of microsatellite inheritance in white sturgeon supports that it is an ancestral octoploid with chromosomes distribution and habitat white sturgeon are native to several large north american rivers that drain to the pacific ocean they primarily live in estuaries of large rivers but migrate to spawn in freshwater and travel long distances between river systems reproducing populations have been documented along the west coast from northern mexico up to the aleutian islands in alaska white sturgeon are commonly found in deep soft bottomed areas of estuaries where movements in the water column is dependent on salinity historical ranges have been modified substantially by overharvesting habitat changes due to dams and river regulations all affecting habitat quality suitability and connectivity in the lower fraser river british columbia movement and abundance are assessed by acoustic tags and mark recapture methods while the model developed by robichaud english and nelson assumes a closed homogenous population acoustic tags and mark-recapture data shows that they are sedentary during the winter months and mobile in the spring and fall with data indicating that they leave the fraser river and enter the strait of georgia during their mobile periods this conclusion has been validated by microchemical evidence of marine exposure in fraser river white sturgeon fin rays construction of dams for hydroelectric power production affects seasonal movement of white sturgeon in many river systems with the columbia river basin being a large contributor to shifts in the distribution and movement the dams present in the basin have largely blocked the upstream movement of sturgeon due to designs of fish ladders being more specified for salmon and steelhead while downstream passage of sturgeon through the dams has been reported the route of passage was never identified downstream movement through the dams are only possible through operating turbines open spill gates and the ice and trash sluiceway diet larval white sturgeon mm in in tl experience the highest mortality when they transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding around days post-hatch depending on conditions once larvae metamorphose into young of the year yoy and juveniles they actively feed on the substrate dominantly corophium spp relying on water currents to carry them downriver to areas of suitable food the availability of corophium spp could play a key role in the survival of larval and yoy white sturgeon in the columbia river and could possibly explain the apparent poor survival of larvae and yoy in some snake and columbia river reservoirs that apparently have successful spawning but poor recruitment juveniles less than mm ft tl are known to feed on tube-dwelling amphipods mysids isopods corophium spp and other benthic invertebrates as well as on the eggs and fry of other fish species adults greater than mm ft consume a variety prey species adjusting to a piscivorous diet of herring shad starry flounder goby smelt anchovy lamprey and salmon as well as benthic items such as invasive overbite clam with feeding movements influenced due to tidal cycles studies show more active movement at night hinting that white sturgeon may be nocturnal foragers studies have shown that dietary lipid requirements on larval white sturgeon effect overall body composition plasma biochemical parameters and liver fatty acids with increasing dietary lipid levels whole body and muscle lipid content increases as well as increased plasma triglycerides and cholesterol content this shows that larval sturgeon post-hatch grow faster on high lipid diets reducing glycogen stores but increasing stores of lipid in the liver the importance of this can help to understand growth rates in changing environments with varying food sources reproduction white sturgeons are iteroparous breeders with a spawning period in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers between mid-february to late may with peak activity during march and april - kohlhorst there is much uncertainty around reproduction timing of events in white sturgeon with many papers reporting differing results dependent on the river system observed chapman van enennaam and doroshov witnessed sexually mature females mm ft fl in the sacramento-san joaquin river system estimated around nine years old by using the von bertalannfy growth function while the youngest sexual mature was a male mm ft fl estimated to be six years old however other reports have sexual maturity for white sturgeon at twelve years old for females and ten years old for males uncertainty around age estimates from fin ray annulus may account for any disparity spawning periodicity is thought to be two to four years for females and one to two years for males behavior during spawning is not well known but it is known that they are communal broadcast spawners where a females eggs are fertilized by many males when ready to spawn white sturgeon choose a variety of substrates dependent on the river system spawning on gravel or rocky substrate in moderate to fast currents with observed depths of m ft and water velocities at the bottom on a range of - msec when eggs are released by the female they are negatively buoyant and develop an adhesive coat upon contact with water which allows them to attach to the substrate near where they were spawned hatching time is temperature dependent and can range from days optimal temperature is between and c and f with mortality observed below c f and above c f importance to humans white sturgeon are a resource to a variety of different social and economic groups around the world aquaculture facilities cultivate white sturgeon in california and juveniles can be sold to aquarists they were once the main food source for native americans in the 1800s until overfishing by commercial fleets for caviar drove them to near extinction by the early 1900s besides their meat other important economic products associated with caught sturgeon are caviar isinglass and oil while selling a wild white sturgeon and eggs is illegal in california it is legal to buy legal caviar from california white sturgeon farms poaching is an ongoing issue in which caviar can sell on the black market for us100150 per pound while a consumer buying legally made caviar from california sturgeon farms pays anywhere from us40 to for an ounce white sturgeon also play a role in sport fishing in the pacific northwest while closed to retention in the columbia river basin catch and release fishing is allowed with enough popularity for guiding services to offer fishing trips targeted specifically at white sturgeon conservation status trends in white sturgeon abundance has been monitored in california for decades with data showing large variations in recruitment including five or more consecutive years of low or no recruitment with probable cause being due to low flows during winter andor spring months although some present white sturgeon populations have been reduced over the past years some population trends in california are promising resulting in new angling regulations monitoring research efforts fish passage and habitat restoration despite being a relatively robust population that includes tens of thousands of sub-adults and adults management is complicated due to exposure of pollutants freshwater and estuary alteration harvest and because of its long life span which can mask detection of reproductive success natureserve ranks white sturgeon globally secure but imperiled in california due to anthropogenic impacts on their habitats the american fisheries society considers them to be endangered the convention on international trade in endangered species cites of wild fauna and flora has white sturgeon listed as appendix ii which includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction but in which trade must be

a deadly monster from the deep killing all these people its quite possible this is the biggest fish ive ever had on the end of my line one of my obsessions is tracking down freshwater monsters throughout the worlds rivers but a story of one monster in an alaskan lake particularly caught my imagination there are many myths of lake monsters all around the world from places such as loch ness in scotland and lake tianchi in china no ones sure these creatures have actually been seen but this monster in lake clark in iliamna is different since the 1940s bush pilots have been flying over this remote area and sightings seem to be getting more and more frequent there are reports of it being up to feet long what are these mysterious shapes in the*****************are they causing people to drown and disappear into the depths without leaving a trace people have tried to prove its existence for many years years ago there was even a reward put on its head thats half a million in todays money this kind of bounty attracted many monster hunters from serious fishermen to someone who tried to lure it out of the water by playing music all these attempts failed and eventually the reward was withdrawn with still no hard proof it would be easy to dismiss this monster as pure fantasy but i believe these stories must have come from somewhere and there is something down there in the depths this is my first trip to*****************and my journey starts by going deep into its wilderness i normally fish in the tropics and im out of my element in a land of bottomless icy lakes jagged mountains and arctic tundra as a proportion of its population more people go missing in this forbidding landscape than in any other state in the us the best way into this isolated area is by plane threading your way through narrow mountain passes where conditions can deteriorate in a moment there are many legends of this monster but between the smoke of the clouds and the mirrors of the lakes could it actually exist my investigation to find out will focus on two connected bodies of water lake clark*****************dotted around the lakes these are the people who will have been here for generations and thesell be the people who have the stories about the monster the people i want to talk to people have lived on this land for more than years and for centuries theyve fished these lakes wearing lightweight waterproof parkas made from seal gut these isolated communities have a strong ancestral tradition of myths and legends including the lake monster im meeting up with the hill family who are athabaskan native alaskans they have a fishing camp on the northern shore of lake iliamna if you look at the shape of iliamna lake on the map it has a shape of a fish theres a large head tapering down to - a tail - a tail and the legend is thats how this lake was formed it was this huge fish that was trapped by*****************mountains and when a fish is dying or iaying on its side it flops and kind of makes a hole some people say even the name iliamna means a great black fish could this be biting holes in peoples boats people just wouldnt paint their boats a certain colour and you didnt wanna paint the bottom of the boat red i guess there was some connection between painting the bottom of a boat red and it disappearing the red couldve attracted the predatory monster thinking it was blood from some injured prey these legends of the monster are clearly ingrained within local culture the problem with oral history is it can be very hard to pin down exactly when*****************he was getting broken off several times - so thats when he put the cable down there - he kept getting broken off the mechanic then fashioned his own hook and fixed it to the end of the cable this was then tied to a washed up tree stump he knew that he had a line there that fish would not break and so he decided whatever kind of monster was busting off his line that wasnt gonna happen to him again confident that hed get his fish this time he left and planned to come back the next morning a neighbour that lived by the river observed that stump passing by against the wind and the lake was very rough and the gentleman that observed this was very surprised how could this tree stump be moving against the water against the wind and the waves that is one of*****************most amazing fishing stories ive heard because from what you describe about the stump it sounds like a few men would struggle to shift it and something in the water has just ripped it out of the bank dragged it across the lake and to this day nobody knows what it was and you know it could still be down there somewhere thats quite a thought glen has told me the exact spot where the stump weighing nearly pounds was ripped from the shore and dragged into the water im going to see what i can catch at this location ive brought a tent ive brought my rod and im going to be throwing a bait into this very*****************area of the lake ive got some pretty thick cable with me this is probably about this is about 250-pound breaking strain the thing about the stump is there was no no give anywhere in the system so thats why it got ripped out but if you can actually let the fish have some line this fished correctly stands more chance than a bit of aircraft cable tied to a stump this is not the kind of rod youd normally see being used in freshwater this is sort of a marine big game rod it would normally be put to use pulling in shark marlin tuna - that kind of thing but everything ive heard about this place theres*****************in here every bit as big as those animals a fish the size of what ive been hearing could actually sink a boat if youre attached attached to it on a line you know if that line jams so i will be carrying a knife because the worst case scenario is something sounding heading towards the bottom the line getting jammed and id rather lose the fish than lose my life theres a steep drop-off thats further than i can cast the heavy line so im using a kayak to get my bait to a spot where a giant might hide im actually glad im only about yards out into this lake not miles i can really see how*****************it lying on the bottom overnight and see if i can tempt the monster onto my line its just a waiting game now its getting close to night but during the alaskan summer it never gets completely dark its actually very strange being up in the alaskan night because its well after midnight now and i can see the far bank i can see the horizon there i can see the mist over the mountains its a very sort of strange other-worldly place the bait has been in the water for over hours if the monster was nearby and hungry it wouldve taken it by now theres nothing there the baits still there when the weather comes in the lakes are covered in an eerie fog i heard this story about something coming again and again for fish in the water and er i went there and offered a prime*****************of fish and just nothing doing at all the stories ive heard from the alaskan natives shroud these lakes in myths and legends such as if you see the monster a tragedy will soon befall your family in conditions like these the brain becomes very suggestible and its easy for your mind to play tricks on you i actually thought i saw something back there and i did a real double-take but i think it was just the dark long face of a wave and i can really imagine how if youre out here any amount of time youre gonna see things even if theres nothing there this place has a special atmosphere but im a rationalist ive got*****************stay detached and not let my imagination get in the way to move this investigation on i need to find out if people have actually come into contact with the monster hello bill im meeting up with bill trefon who is alaskan native denaina his family has been living on lake clark for generations i heard that your parents had an encounter with some large unknown creature in the lake a while ago what did they think it was and there are pike in the lake big pike in the lake did your mother have any idea how big it might have been feet going back generations people say that if you actually see one of these big fish*****************like a bad sign tragedies like bills father drowning only help to strengthen the legends surrounding the monster but this story has given me some vital information as to what it could be attacking a propeller suggests it is a sight predator its not some deep water scavenger but its active on the surface this all fits with it being a pike which is what bills mother thought she saw to see if the pike here really can reach such a monstrous size i have to catch one this is chilitma bay near where the boat was attacked and where locals say the biggest pike are ive come across pike in warm water before but ive no idea how*****************they can grow in these glacial conditions a pike has hundreds of needle-sharp teeth that can cause serious damage to whatever gets into its mouth including humans im using here an imitation frog and ive got this little clip here which goes under the hook and the idea of that is it brushes off any weed so i can chuck this right into the middle of the weed and twitch it and so the legs actually kick as i twitch the tip agh whoa went for it but i was a little bit over-excited there and that was right in the weeds im very impressed by the er the aggression of the fish that had a go at the*****************that was only a small fish if that had been a bigger one thered have been an almighty splash but er i think a lot of people who dont fish are very surprised you see a placid bit of water like this and you throw something small in the water and theyll just launch themselves at what they think is a piece of food oh no oh yes theres a fish on theres a fish on its a very gentle take and its a pike its not a very big one whoa jumping look at that that thing jumped out of the water a couple of foot ooh hes gone ok managed to throw the hook but anyway there*****************in there when releasing one two weeks ago i had uh releasing one by the tail it turned and did a a small 30-inch pike and it took a bite out of my hand as i was releasing it and so after it bit a hook already then it came for my hand after that even if it wouldve been a 40-inch fish it probably wouldve took done some damage to my tendons and my fingers if a four or five-foot pike can eat water fowl and mammals it seems logical that a 12-footer could be a man eater so what ive got here is a lure that sends out very strong signals its a very bright flash and a very strong vibrating throb that was probably what happened when that fish went for that propeller fish on fish on fish on oh its a nice size fish its a*****************size fish here we go thats a nice fish hes going under the boat i dont want him to go the other side look at that lovely fish lovely clear water so you can see the fish really well a lovely alaskan pike just do a quick measure here inches lovely fish a 40-inch pike is probably around years old the thing about a pike if theres ever a fish where the way it looks tells you about the way it lives that is the pike you know head full of teeth at one end not just on the jaws but on the tongue on the gill rake as well and they have eyes that make them a deadly*****************predator you can really see here these sighting grooves sort of converging on the prey here so a bit like sighting grooves on a on a rifle and they can just judge the distance to the prey and theyre so wonderfully camouflaged blending into weed very long streamlined shape and then youve got the dorsal fin right at the back so youve got a big propulsion unit as soon as that prey comes within range it lunges and once its in those teeth theres no getting away so just a perfect predator this fish there she goes ive seen that pike can certainly be aggressive theyll hit a piece of vibrating flashing metal on the end of a line*****************suppose that once in a while they might possibly hit a boat propeller the thing thats bothering me is that bills mother talked about seeing something that was foot long and pike just dont get that big theyd be really pushed to reach even half that length and at that size theyre not gonna be knocking anybody out of a boat and they dont pose a threat to anybody in the water so im doubtful that what bills parents encountered was a pike but i do believe that what they encountered could have been the lake monster but what is there in the water that can reach that kind of size something monstrous could have come in from the*****************in the lake to support an animal of that size is there enough food in lake iliamna to feed a monster there is one event each year in these waters that could be what im looking for every july there is the worlds largest run of sockeye salmon im normally busy catching river monsters in the warmest parts of the world and fishing for salmon is totally new to me the temperatures have affected things a little bit so the run is the timing is a little bit off from normal years but it should be a good place to have the salmon start packing in with all this water and the unpredictable nature of the salmon run it can actually be quite hard to find the salmon but one very good way to find them is to look for bears because thats the only reason theyre by the water*****************to feed on the salmon and actually weve just spotted our first bear so were going to er come in and have a closer look here this is bear country and they depend on the salmon run for food - so ill be in direct competition with them for the best fishing spots were only about miles from where self-styled grizzly expert timothy treadwell and his girlfriend were eaten alive by a hungry grizzly is this the place where we saw the bear from the plane yes you can see a very regular bear trail where theyre coming and going from the river if a bear comes close to us well stand side by side and try to look*****************like they do then typically theyll just move around you and then move off if a bears trying to fish in an area though the last thing we wanna do is for that bear to think that we want the fishing hole and we expect it to move so if they want it well let em have it carrying a gun at all times is common practice in the alaskan wilderness and in case a bear does attack my pilot glen alsworth junior is carrying a 50-calibre handgun the bears may have already found a good fishing spot just literally feet from where im standing theres been a steady procession of fish through working their way upstream and theres*****************some big dark groups holding further down so im looking forward to getting a line in the water there are no bears in sight so it seems safe to try and catch my first salmon when sockeye salmon come out of the sea and enter freshwater the males undergo a monstrous transformation they develop a hooked jaw and grow teeth to defend their spawning grounds not only that both the males and females turn red and stop feeding so they wont go for any bait or fly what youre doing is youre casting out youve got a lump of lead here and you flick it degrees upstream it comes down and the fish are all facing upstream and the*****************is theyve got their mouths open like this and it gets in their mouth that panics them they run and as they run that ends up in the mouth so it feels like a strike and that will be in the mouth probably like that but theyre not actually going for it thats the theory lets see time to try and get my first salmon there you go you got it agh hes off i actually hooked one that was a bit of a surprise the line just was ticking down and they havent spooked off too far just ticking down it just stopped and i was a bit too surprised i pulled i shouldve tried to set the*****************a bit more on that one with this many salmon around its not long before the bears return to their fishing spot heres a bear just coming out of the brush on the far side whereabouts is it glen hes just looking out of the brush watching for salmon oh yeah thats a very definite fishermans posture isnt it you can tell hes ready to pounce down in the water within minutes three large grizzlies have surrounded us our day on the river has suddenly become dangerous this is typical you find a good spot somebody else comes in tries to elbow you out though in this case im going to make a graceful retreat he may turn back*****************fish between us and the bear definitely a good time to keep talking keep making noise that way if he has his nose under the water he can still hear us and doesnt end up popping out of the water close to us and having to make a decision about how hes gonna react with the bears this close i can pick up some fishing tips i think he needs a bit of practice its almost on a level with my early fly-fishing attempts they wait till theres a bunch of fish congregated underneath them and then just jump on top of them that way cos i guess a bit like a human fisherman if theres lots of fish*****************if youre a bit inept youre still going to youre still gonna get something once theyve moved off a bit i can carry on trying to catch my first salmon but these grizzlies are putting me to shame agh fantastic to see these bears close up i wasnt expecting that you can see theyre semi-aquatic i dont think this is the lake monster but you could call it in some ways a bit of a river monster ah here we go believe it or not this is the first salmon ive ever had on the end of my line this is a fish that can swim hundreds of miles up these fast-flowing rivers to get to its spawning grounds*****************it can put up a strong fight fish has done me a favour its turned off the main flow im so engrossed with catching a salmon i dont notice our interested onlooker out of the water out of the water ok ok right i think were gonna want to break the fish off claps noisily shouting and clapping does he want the fish this bear is clearly not afraid of us and thats a problem shall we just break it off shouting im just gonna break the fish off this is a young grizzly but although not fully grown it could still attack and kill any one of us you can have the fish luckily its more interested in*****************salmon than us it took my fish and a minute later its back for more this time we need to fire a warning shot im gonna fire one - hes getting too pushy - shouts - no - you guys plug your ears - gunshot - just deep breaths just calm down its all all part of the er the day in the life of a fisherman in this part of the world even after a warning shot the bear wont leave so its best that my film crew and i get out i didnt quite succeed in landing my first salmon but its clear that they are a vital food source to the whole area with millions of*****************coming in every year and fish like pike in these waters year round im convinced that there is enough food to sustain the monster ive been hearing about back on the trail of the monster my investigation has taken a leap forward this could be the breakthrough ive needed im meeting up with robyn levine who saw the monster last year while coming in to land on lake iliamna hello lovely place to work robyn is an anthropologist who works on these lakes studying subsistence fishing by the alaska native people and it was round here you saw the monster as well i gather yes the iliamna lake monster shes trained to observe things accurately so has a clear*****************of what she saw robyn is going to show me exactly where she saw the monster from the air theres the drop-off yeah you see the clear shallow right over there - yeah - um thats where we saw it right there it was over on that very clear patch oh really we probably had a good to seconds maybe longer to see it initially i thought it was a seal but almost immediately after that thought crossed my mind i realised it was far too big and it moved differently it had a long broad head blunted nose there were very distinct pectoral fins fins on the side of the fish what about the size of this as*****************were pulling into the bay where we were landing and my friend was coming to pick us up in his boat i estimated that what we saw was about the same size as his boat and thats to feet long feet is the same size as three of me end to end and much bigger than what bills mother saw attacking her boat it looked so normal ive seen beluga from the air ive seen seals from the air it looked a part of the natural environment and i was sure there was some obvious explanation for what we saw this is the breakthrough i needed a graphic description of its shape from somebody who saw it recently and*****************observed it clearly for some time and from her description the thing that struck me most was how much she emphasised its fins now on a normal fish seen from above like salmon you dont see the fins because theyre tucked in or folded away but there are certain fish where particularly the pectoral fins behind the head really stick out a bit like wings almost this is a crucial bit of the description and i now really do think i have my prime suspect ive now got a strong suspicion that the monster ive been looking for is a white sturgeon its a living dinosaur that has changed very little over million years their range is all along*****************west coast of north america from mid-california all the way up to alaska they can survive in both salt and freshwater and ive also seen how the river that connects lake iliamna to the sea is easily deep enough for them to swim up even though theyre bottom feeders they have an interesting behaviour they can jump out of the water in recent years a relative of theirs the gulf sturgeon has been seriously injuring people in florida could jumping white sturgeon in lake iliamna and lake clark be the basis of the myths of fishermen going missing could they be causing people to disappear knocking them out of their boats and into the freezing water to prove my*****************i need to get my hands on a big sturgeon however what were talking about here is an absolutely immense body of water where nobody has ever caught one and where the sightings are less than once a year so to get one on the end of a line if i had years i might be in with half a chance but realistically its just not gonna happen here my challenge has always been to catch this monster and by hook or by crook im going to get one with the odds stacked against me here im leaving alaska and going down to the coiumbia river on the oregonwashington border here they have a large population of white sturgeon*****************ill have a much better chance of catching one this will be another first for me ive never caught a white sturgeon and i hear they can put up an incredible fight this line although its very fine is actually er it actually has a breaking strain of pounds its braided line the thing about this is its nice and supple so er its not going to drag a lot in the water but another thing about it is its got no stretch virtually no stretch compared to nylon monofilament normal fishing line what that means is if i hook a big fish with this i havent got that elasticity of the line im gonna feel everything very very*****************up here so its gonna be quite a physical um struggle with the fish on this gear so just one final detail what were using here is a barbless hook theres no barb on there thats very much about just looking after the fish we need to go quick were on the backing were on the backing im going to drop this bait into about feet of water there we go its fully rigged i think its still sinking thats going down in about foot of water and its bumped the bottom bring it in there thats fine any time now something could take that one very obvious difference between here and lake iliamna is that here youve got*****************current - the water is moving whereas in a lake in still water the bait sits there and the scent diffuses out very slowly there can be fish not very far away maybe not aware that its there but er moving water here that bait is really advertising itself down the current oh thats a bit of a knock again there bit of a knock somethings definitely interested in it its at that point where all your imaginings about whats under the water they are well theyre starting to take shape whatever it is is on the end of that line but that line is so fine the water heres pretty deep foot or so im attached to something*****************a there it is there it is there it is there it is my first white sturgeon and the animal i think can easily grow to become a lake monster its a bit of a tug of war this i just bring it up and then hook out while taking the hook out my chance to finally see the monster up close eludes me that was a very very brief contact with the animal there i was leaning over the side i couldnt reach as far as i wanted the sturgeon are clearly here and that one was about five feet long but i want a larger one white sturgeon can grow to about feet its not long before*****************get my next bite and this one feels much bigger this fish could be bigger than i am when the fish wants to go im letting it go but im letting it go under pressure its having to work for the line it takes away and then when the fish takes a bit of a breather im hoping you know in those little gaps that i can gain a wee bit of line i think we might have to it might be an idea to cast off i think it might help if we cast off are we going are we on our way this is a long long run were running out of line here were running out*****************line we need to go quick were on the backing were on the backing wait a minute thats the end of my line there off the reel i wanna get the proper line back on the reel right there we are weve got the line back on the reel that was hairy i was watching my line going that lines coming up on the water theres the fish theres the fish there it is there we go there we go there we go there we go agh ive seen the fish now that is certainly a big fish its taken me half an hour to bring this sturgeon in knowing that this is only around half the length they*****************grow to i now totally believe that a larger one could drag a tree stump into the water that was a tiring fight ive caught some big fish in freshwater this is probably the biggest freshwater fish ive caught er about pounds this one so you know a real monstrous fish another thing thats very notable about this fish is that its got very small eyes for such a large animal i think what that tells you is vision doesnt play a very big part in its world finding its way around and also finding food and if you look a bit closer at the head you see those four feelers hanging down near the mouth thats how it*****************the water how it found the bait the scent trail coming down the current led it to my bait also interesting theres such amazing patterning all over the fish but here on the snout youve got these vibration sensors the kind of thing that most fish have down the lateral line to pick up any vibrations in the water which could tell them where prey is its just like if youre a human being its just a sense were not used to just feeling vibrations but very very apparent there that a fish like this lives in a different world perceives its world differently down there in the dark water foot down in terms of its difference from other*****************and in terms of its size this really is a remarkable creature thats actually or even inches thats eight foot inches nearly nine foot nearly nine foot this fish its quite a thought thats one and a half times me at nine feet this fish is roughly years old but they can live to over this looks big in the water but these things grow to foot possibly even more imagine seeing that in the water you could be forgiven for saying that was a monster up to feet long matches all the descriptions of the monster including robyns plus the pectoral fins and the long streamlined body fit how she described what she saw but what about the*****************marks on the propeller just take a look at the mouth although you could say its predatory - its eaten quite a large dead fish - but theres no teeth in there at all i can put my hands in there its almost its very telescopic you can imagine that extending and literally sucking in a small fish having only gums means it couldnt have been teeth marks on the propeller but i think i know what caused them whats interesting about a sturgeon it hasnt got a bony skeleton the way most fish have - its just got cartilage but what it has got is bony plates on the outside of the body not totally covering it but*****************in rows these are some form of protection they are quite tough bits of bone and also a very bony head a very bony gill flap as well i believe bill trefons parents actually ran over a white sturgeon and the propeller going over its bony plates caused what looked like teeth marks it may not have any teeth but this mouth is perfectly formed for being a bottom feeder eating molluscs and small fish this explains why it is so rarely seen on lake iliamna or lake clark because it spends most of its time in up to feet of water on the rare occasions when they do come to the surface this could be what is causing*****************people to disappear their jumping nobody knows why they jump out of the water maybe its a panic reaction to being disturbed but when they do an airborne giant could easily knock somebody out of their boat and into the icy depths this all makes me convinced that the alaskan lake monster is actually a small landlocked population of white sturgeon but so impressive just to get close to an animal like that to touch it and look at it close up and i really think that for a few moments there i was actually in the presence of the creature that is the lake monster,white sturgeon sinosturio transmontanus is a species of sturgeon in the family acipenseridae

rift valley killer,nile perch,lates niloticus,africas rift valley is by all accounts one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a fisherman storms come out of nowhere giant crocs attack from beneath hippos maul you to death and rival gangs will kill you for your catch but the rewards of fishing here can be spectacular there are reports of rare but very real giants living here so ive decided to head to one of the deadliest fishing spots in the world as it may be my last chance to catch this massive river monster this could be my most dangerous mission yet thunder rumbles im jeremy wade ive made my name investigating improbable fishermens tales from around the world and tracking down the bloodthirsty river monsters that lie behind them but theres one place ive heard of where the death rate for fishermen apparently exceeds all others its the birthplace of mankind - the rift valley in east africa formed by two continental plates pulling apart its a monumental scar spanning several countries and containing a series of lakes and rivers i want to find out just how dangerous it is to fish out there but i also want to catch the giant at the heart of this region the mputa or nile perch is africas largest freshwater fish and its the reason fishermen here have been putting their lives at risk for millennia just one animal can feed an entire village this fish can apparently reach weights in excess of 400ibs and measure over 6ft long they are ambush predators and they will eat anything they can fit in their mouths including cannibalising nile perch up to a third of their own size giants like this used to be caught regularly but as in so many parts of the world population pressures have led to over-fishing i thought all the big ones had long gone but just a few months ago i received some pictures that suggest there are monster nile perch still out there so ive travelled to the heart of africa to the white nile in uganda - the site of that extraordinary catch im actually now fishing in the very spot where the largest ever nile perch which was accurately weighed was caught on a rod and line this fish weighed just slightly under 250ibs and was almost 7ft long unfortunately though that fish was attacked by a crocodile and it didnt survive its wounds so that fish is no longer in this river but its quite possible there could be others the same size or maybe even bigger hmm im just going to tighten it that was uh something definitely hit that bait but it wasnt it wasnt particularly confident it ripped a couple of feet and then and then stopped oh ive got a circle oh here we go yeah there is a fish on if i could get this ratchet off the lines coming up thats a nile perch - its a good size one there it is in this part of the nile the goal is to land fish quickly before the crocs come looking for easy prey its a decent size nile perch and a great start to my quest for a giant now this is quite an unusual capture it actually swallowed the bait fish head-first down to about here i think it was actually this dorsal barb of the bait fish that actually stopped the bait coming out of its throat not the hook lets just oh lets just support it maybe like that look at that lets get down ok very nice fish - 70ibs something like that but a beautiful fish lovely beautiful colouration very strong as well the paddle-like tail and muscular body indicate a fish designed for power and acceleration these fish are ambush predators relying on their large eyes to target prey and just a cavernous mouth on this thing it just inhales its food fish whole ive got to let this fish recover before i let it go and that means exposing myself to a potential croc attack but out here in the middle of the river its my only option what i want now is one that weighs maybe three times that encouraged by my success and aware there could be even bigger monsters on the prowl i decide to head downstream for my next cast as the commotion of that catch could have spooked everything close by but as im travelling i see a heavily fortified barrier in the water that confirms that crocs are a very real problem here - this is protection from something in the water - it is like a crocodile these villagers risk their lives simply collecting their days supply of water this is a serious barrier and its pretty solid theres not much in the way of spaces between there that is to stop crocodiles taking people when theyre collecting water so this is a very definite sign the people here take them very seriously on this piece of river have people been killed by crocodiles yeah it was a local fisherman who lost his life and apparently this is not uncommon nile crocodiles are thought to kill hundreds of people every year making them responsible for more fatal attacks on humans than lions bears and sharks combined maybe i was a bit foolhardy holding that fish in the water the locals certainly dont seem to be taking any chances but its not just creatures in the water i have to look out for the weather is extreme and can turn in a matter of minutes a bit of a storm can sometimes get the fish stirred up get them feeding but looking at all the lightning im not sure holding a conducting rod up in the air in the middle of this is a very good idea so if they dont feed its not gonna be too much of a disappointment storms in this part of the world are sudden and brutal in fishermen drowned when their boat capsized in a storm just a few hours away from here so i decide to bring in my line weve got torn away from our mooring on the bank soaked through if were not careful we could become the next deathly statistic but as quickly as it started the storm stops im just hoping it hasnt ruined my chances trouble with rain is if its heavy you just get all this rubbish coming off the land and colouring the water and if youre fishing for a sight predator like the nile perch you can forget it luckily ive got a bit of a clear patch next to the bank but its colouring up as i speak you know if more run-off comes from the land or if it rains more it could just put an end to the fishing for me reel unwinds could this be the catch that proves truly giant nile perch are still out there - that is definitely a fish - thunder rumbles the troubles is over there theres a big storm coming in with lightning coming down the storm seems to have swung back around and this is exactly what i didnt want my carbon fiber rod in the air like a lightning conductor as the wind picks up an incredible people are killed by lightning strikes worldwide every year and uganda is known for having the highest frequency of thunder storms anywhere in the world thats a catfish but looks to be quite a good size ive got to land this fish before the storm returns thats actually ok i was after a nile perch but thats a nice size catfish this one is uh a semutundu catfish its missing a bit of its tentacle here but uh totally different from the nile perch long body shape its a predator as well you can see the muscle blocks clear on the side catfish are right at home in the muddy water with their strong sense of smell and ability to sense movement in the murk its probably not much of a surprise i caught one of these rather than a nile perch right get this back in the water very quickly then i think weve got to run for it thunder rumbles oh i dont want to be caught in another lethal storm besides this river is rapidly turning to mud theres no way ill be catching a sight feeder like the nile perch for at least a few days so i decide to head up the white nile to its source at lake victoria this is lake victoria one of the biggest bodies of freshwater anywhere in the world but its also a place where i hear they are still catching nile perch in some quantity it seems like a calm and tranquil lake but my complacency is about to be rocked if i was in any doubt that i had come to a dangerous region to fish then seeing the body of a fisherman driven off in a makeshift ambulance confirms that this could be my most dangerous mission yet this just goes to show just how regular accidents are with the fishermen just came down to the lake and theres police here been called in because a body has been recovered on the side of the lake its quite hard to establish what happened but it sounds like this was a fisherman who couldnt swim and somehow ended up in the water this is a very big body of water its like fishing the sea out here so in a way its not surprising and people go out in very flimsy boats just another example of the dangers and also how common accidents can be maybe the fisherman got caught up in the storm that i just avoided its pretty sobering to see how little fuss his death has caused but in this place its a wonder any fisherman survives the deadly predators or the raging waters and if im not careful i could be the next body they drag out of the water despite the risks ive got to stick to my goal proving that there are still monster mputa or nile perch out here and that i can survive catching them where they live in the oldest and perhaps most dangerous fishing region in the world ive come to lake victoria in the african rift valley to prove that there are still monster mputa or nile perch out here however in the late 1950s they were introduced to create an industry for the surrounding countries and in just a few decades they took over out-competing the native fish species and reaching enormous sizes as they were without any real natural predators this fish was apparently 340ibs but it was caught some five years ago and the locals havent seen anything as big since however with the lake covering square miles there could still be some giants that have stayed hidden this is an inlet of lake victoria here they are actually catching nile perch and not just a few its serious serious quantities this boat is just full of them just one after another after another but none of them are the giants that im after a quick chat reveals that this ice boat collects the fish netted by a fleet of some small fishing vessels this is fishing on an industrial scale this boats been out for three days apparently and theres three to four tonnes of fish in here thats a lot of fish ive been invited behind closed factory doors to see the nile perch industry in action it provides thousands of jobs to the area and it earns over 200m in revenue every year this is the reason truly giant nile perch as so rare these days so apparently theres about 10-12 tonnes of processed fish leaving this factory every day which is you know a huge amount i mean quite mind-boggling particularly when you consider its a freshwater fish well certainly impressive quantity of fish coming out of the lake but one thing that really struck me is that the the big ones are just really few and far between just trying to do a bit of the maths and i reckon id have to plough through something like fish that size to have even half a chance of getting something half decent so im gonna have to try and find a place where they dont have such intensive commercial harvesting i decide to head further up the rift valley to ethiopia as the fishing there is far from industrial in fact its still conducted in much the same way that it has been for tens of thousands of years and the nile perch has always been the ultimate prize ethiopia is one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world this is the birthplace of mankind the home of lucy ardi and many of the so-called missing links but there are also traces of the very first fishermen here at the ethiopian national museum ive been allowed access behind the scenes at the museum and in this very room are some of the oldest human remains anywhere in the world but what im looking at at the moment are some of the earliest ever fishing implements its fairly clear that these were used for fish because in the same place were found remains of fish they found a skull there just the skull was 3ft long so the whole fish 7ft 8ft something like that so whoever was using these harpoons here could have been after some fairly interesting fish back then im overwhelmed to be this close to the earliest tools of my trade it turns out that this skull belonged to a giant mputa or nile perch it looks like this modern-day monster has been a valued prize for thousands of years the ancient egyptians revered nile perch for the amount of food they could provide they even mummified these sacred fish and entombed them with their dead its no wonder theres a huge industry harvesting these fish today but if i want to catch one then i need to head to the spots that are hardest to reach where the fishing is so dangerous the locals wont even attempt it maybe heres where ill find my giant these are the headwaters of the biue nile in ethiopia from here this water will go a couple of thousand miles all the way to the mediterranean there are two main branches of the nile river i started my search on the ugandan white nile but this is the biue nile and nile perch are found along its entire length these falls are known locally as tis isat which translates as the water that smokes the mist has made these rocks incredibly slippery if i fall into this swirling water i could be swept downstream too fast to be rescued theres definitely no commercial fishing here so maybe at these falls ill catch my monster theres a fish there is a oh its off that was a fish that was a a knock then a tighten then i felt something on there ill just wind it up and see i cant actually see any signs there tooth marks or anything like that but there was definitely something on there i think i should lob that out again asap i continue fishing for another few hours but whatever that was lurking in this pool it seems to have been spooked and it didnt feel like the giant im after so i decide to move on i head south to another lake as i hear big mputa are the villagers target species fishing techniques here have remained pretty much the same for thousands of years maybe if i leave my hi-tech equipment behind for now and join these fishermen theyll share their secrets of where they catch their fish this is lake chamo in africas rift valley just looking around today even in the st century this place has the look of somewhere that could hold a real serious monster lake chamo is in the south of the ethiopian rift valley and it is known for the size of the beasts that live here and these beasts arent just fish i generally scout out an area before i fish but on this lakeside im not alone and im not sure i like it im not used to jostling for position with man-eaters these guys can eat up to half their own body weight in a single meal and very often its fishermen that end up on the menu its situations like this that make you rethink your place on the food chain im normally the person doing the hunting but im very aware now that im having to look around watch my back something might have its eye on me im feeling a little bit more relaxed now rustling theres crocs still in some of these reeds here didnt actually see the animal but heard the movement as it went through the reeds it seems like the big nile perch are only going to be found where the dangers are high im hoping to get some survival advice from a group of fishermen camped out on the lakes shore speaks local language so why is it off the ground why have you got it raised up off the ground speaks local language one reason its off the ground is just to keep them dry but theres also just a real menagerie of animals thats active at night they say even pythons will come and snuggle up to you if youre lying on the ground just last year a man was nearly killed by a 13ft python he only escaped by using his cellphone to raise the alarm so you actually live here all the year round it very much is you know a very hardcore way of life this it is set apart from the rest of society but i think quite a few people here have got rather shady pasts and they cant really go back so that explains why they do live on the edges this very basic existence and putting up with the very real dangers that go with this way of life its a fairly lawless society down here by all accounts and im not exactly comfortable in their presence apparently some of these men are wanted by the police for crimes that include murder this man tells me that not long ago he was out fishing with a friend when he was attacked by a rival gang conflict like this has been going on for centuries shouting they stole his nets and boats and apparently he was lucky to escape alive the dangers here come at you from all directions im honoured but a little uneasy when these fishermen on the fringe invite me to join their meal so is this tilapia tilapia little bit of spice tilapia are a small fish that they commonly target as they are easier to catch than the nile perch ah clears throat very good sushi tilapia actually not bad mm thank you i realise that if im to fish here i really need to know the risks ill be facing what about the dangers on the lake ive seen the hippos ive seen the crocodiles is this something that you worry about every day speaks local language most of these animals the hippos and the crocs will be close to the shore thats the dangerous area so what they do they deploy their nets out in the middle of the lake in the deeper water but theyve still got to go through the shallows on their way and on their way back but they say even so there are people whove worked with them in the past who have been killed by both hippos and by crocs despite their lumbering looks many consider hippos africas most dangerous animal as they often kill fishermen this man knows just how real that danger is he was attacked by a hippo just a few months ago while on his way to the lake to fish for nile perch speaks local language he was walking with nets along a path and then he noticed a hippo when he saw the hippo he called out and his friend ran off at that point the hippo charged him the next thing that happens is that the hippo is goring him in the side of the chest screaming the hippo has these two sharp tusks on the lower jaw apparently it was spearing him with these tusks and in the process of that flipped him over onto his back he basically just thought he was going to die and he was praying for it to stop praying that he would survive somehow speaks local language it appeared that his prayers had been answered because the hippo stopped goring him and started moving off towards the lake towards the water shortly after that his friend came back and found him what injuries were you left with after this can you show your this horrific wound on the chest here - apparently there were three ribs broken with bits of rib actually visible sticking out likewise the wounds on the leg - there was a flap of skin hanging out for me it just really underlines just what a dangerous job this is what a dangerous place this is to be a fisherman i mean i can scarcely begin to imagine what its like working as a fisherman on this lake but if i want to learn how they catch the mputa im going to have to fish like they do so i head out with one of the guys to check their nets but i hadnt counted on their boats being so flimsy and exposed this is a bit nerve-wracking theres a pod of hippos over there its not them im worried about but theres a couple of others on the fringes of the group which periodically go under then come back up again and theyve been coming back up closer and closer im trying to get to the deep water cos thats gonna be safer than the shallows where the hippos and crocs are hippos very very close looking this way going underwater i dont like the look of this actually after what ive just heard i want to stay well clear of these hippos they are just as dangerous in the water and they have been known to flip boats chomping the occupants to death if i get on the wrong side of a hippo especially in this tiny canoe ill be lucky to escape alive but my only option is to just get on with it if like the local fishermen you are dependent on the fish you catch to stay alive youve got to work with the dangers bit of a ropey old net this looks like a few crocs and hippos have actually gone through this its good having something to do while im out here rather than just drifting the thought of whats down there - the crocs and the hippos down there oh theres a fish already so this is a tilapia this is what the fishermen mostly catch - what they catch in numbers in these lakes and they dont run to a great deal bigger than this spiny dorsal fin lovely blue-ish colouration there yeah just very pretty but the reason theyre catching them is they are very very good eating which is whats gonna happen to this one the rest of the net doesnt yield any more fish let alone a nile perch but apparently they are out there and they are the prize that makes facing the unseen dangers worthwhile the fishermen on this lake are proving to be some of the bravest people ive met however in his pursuit of fish this guy has pushed his luck to the limit speaks local language this is actually quite a story hed earlier seen a crocodile in this area and what hed done hed thrown stones at the crocodile to make it go away he just saw the crocodile sink he assumed then that it was safe to go in the water screams that crocodile grabbed him by the left leg what crocodiles do they try and pull you into deeper water to drown you thats how they kill you before they then dismember you later on speaks local language but the crocodile actually then got tangled in the net and the fisherman was able to actually come free of the crocodiles jaws but you said there were two times another time also a crocodile attack the second time was two years later deploying the net and as hes paying out the net he felt something go like that on his toe this was a crocodile standing on his right foot at that point hes thinking here we go again he managed to half get on the boat right leg on the boat and then the crocodile came along and grabbed his left leg again one tooth of the crocodile went in his leg because the boat was in the way the crocodile couldnt get a good grip on him so eventually the crocodiles grip slipped and he was able to escape im thinking this is a very lucky guy he probably doesnt feel hes lucky to have this happen twice but the fact hes escaped twice from the jaws of crocodiles that is absolutely impressive for anybody im really glad i dont have to earn my living fishing from this lake and the one that attacked you same size as this i reckon that croc must be about 15ft long and close to 1000ibs fishermen here have a lot to be afraid of so its no wonder that religion plays such an important part in their lives this spectacular rock-hewn church is devoted to the patron saint of ethiopia a man famous for doing battle with an almighty river monster a giant dragon this is bete giyorgis the church of st george this place literally is breathtaking to think this is actually just one solid lump of rock i mean its just a huge sculpture really just incredible this is a classic picture of st george on his horse the dragon lying dead or dying on the ground speaks local language its very very clear from here that so important is he to the people here that there are even people who believe that this story of george and the dragon actually happened here in ethiopia if st george did kill a dangerous ethiopian dragon then its no wonder the locals revere him but as i walk through the nearby town i realise just how significant he is to them st george is so important here in ethiopia that the 23rd of every month is st georges day and here at another church devoted to st george you get these crowds of people coming in to worship as i wait for the mass to finish a man seemingly kitted out as st george himself arrives speaks local language ive just asked this man is he st george hes launched into the whole story telling me the story of st george speaks local language apparently at some point in the distant past human sacrifices were made to appease a dangerous dragon that lived in a lake near a village screams eventually it was the turn of the chiefs daughter but before she was devoured a knight arrived to slay the dragon and save the princess this man was st george speaks local language as the st georges day mass finishes i enter the church to see if i can learn a bit more about what kind of local river monster this dragon might have been well this is the classic picture of st george on his horse dragon slain on the ground and the princess the maiden looking on very very detailed rendition of the dragon its got pretty nasty-looking teeth a forked tongue and these wings with little claws almost on the edge of the wings it seems like the dragon is a composite of all the most deadly animals that are found here in the african rift valley even my nile perch is represented by the wings of this beast the continuing strength of this legend underlines how the people here have been battling creatures in the water for generations and they love a hero who can defeat them i come across one man who took on perhaps the most feared animal here when he was attacked by a crocodile however this time the croc didnt leave empty-handed not only did the crocodile make off with his foot it had done so much damage to his lower leg that his leg was actually amputated above the knee unbelievably he still fishes as this picture here proves he still goes out with just one leg fishing in the very same lake where he had that encounter he has a family to feed so he has to keep facing the dangers but hes not fished this long without learning a thing or two so this tilapia in the picture very interesting he actually used that as live bait for nile perch he knows where the nile perch are he could tell me possibly the places to go and maybe the places to avoid i think this could be a very useful lead after a discussion of tactics with this fearless fisherman i head back out onto lake chamo armed with some inside information about good places to try but to get to them i have to pass a point known as the crocodile market so-called because its a favourite spot for these lake giants to gather apparently the largest nile crocodile ever recorded lived on this lake - a beast about 20ft long and that was only a few years ago seeing this many crocodiles hauled out in the sun makes me realise just how many man-eating sized monsters are living in this lake just the size of some of these creatures - just enormous ive never seen so many big crocodiles in one place before and as they sink back into the water i can understand why they say its the croc you dont see that will kill you but for now ive got a more immediate problem as again out of nowhere the wind has suddenly picked up the waves have risen and the water has muddied i think if ever theres a deadly place to fish either on rivers or in the sea this is it well this boat is metal theres no inherent buoyancy at all if this develops a leak its going straight down and theres 20ft crocs in here only a prize as big as a nile perch makes facing these risks worthwhile so i push on hoping that ill catch my prey before i become the prey like the old man suggested im using a tilapia as bait itll work better than an artificial lure because the waters very cloudy but the weather here is beating me this is actually not working were being blown so fast were just dragging that behind us its not actually drifting after a few hours getting bashed around by the waves i head into shore for a break basically all the gear on both boats ive got two boats one for me one for equipment and safety but everything just battered around and soaked so weve come into a bit of shelter here downwind of a peninsula that runs out into the lake and letting everything dry but we came past a net and when we came onto the shore a couple of fishermen paddled round in a boat with a sack and erm im just gonna see whats in the sack actually oh i thought that might be a few in there - thats just one fish its a nile perch not so easy to recognise when its just the meat but actually you can see the shape of the fish from this fillet very deep bodied white flesh some red muscle on the outside but very prized for its eating looking at that the tail is going to end about here the head is about here which translates into a fish thats sort of 3ft-4ft long so im guessing thats gonna be a good 50ibs something like that do you catch on a hook or nets speaks local language so fairly industrial fishing methods about 70-80 yard long net and going down about 6-7ft so that was put out last night they checked it today and this was the result one fish but a very nice sized one speaks local language apparently this was caught from an area near here where the bottom is quite rocky thats quite a good sign because everywhere ive been to so far the bottom has been very smooth very level its interesting that this fish was caught in a place where theres a little bit of underwater ups and downs i try my luck at the spot they mentioned a rocky outcrop in the lee of an island nile perch love having cover to ambush their prey from and the underwater ridge here could be perfect for them but despite fishing here for several hours nothing takes over the next few days i fish a variety of locations but it just seems that either the fish arent here or others have gotten here first so this net is definitely designed to catch nile perch looks like ive got some serious competition here eventually i have to admit that this lake is defeating me ive seen how determined the fishermen are here and theyve been harvesting these lakes for thousands of years im beginning to wonder if the nile perch here have been over-fished too its disappointing having to leave these lakes without having caught anything ive seen plenty of monsters but not the one i want if i stayed long enough i might catch something but life is too short for that i think im gonna have to go to one of the other rift valley lakes i have no choice but to head to a place that is truly out of reach of fishermen not only is it illegal to keep fish that are caught here but few local fishermen are willing to test its spectacular natural defences this is murchison falls in uganda ive seen how people in the rift valley fish some pretty extreme dangerous water conditions but i cant imagine anybody fishing here so im thinking that maybe at the bottom of these falls could be the place where im gonna catch my monster nile perch the water at the bottom of these falls is known as the devils cauldron and its where im about to meet my river monster on this journey to catch africas largest freshwater fish ive faced deadly monsters encountered fearless fishermen who have courted death and ive braved storms and lethal conditions in what is surely one of the most deadly places in the world to be a fisherman shouting yet the giant at its heart has so far eluded me as i make my way up to the falls my anticipation is mounting im just approaching what looks like smoke there but that is the spray that is being thrown up by the murchison falls the thought of the size of some of the fish that are down in this churning water you know starting to get a bit of a flutter its really quite frightening the thought of hooking a big fish in this water this could be my best and perhaps last chance of catching a monster this big eddy behind me is called the devils cauldron now that sounds very melodramatic very over the top but words almost dont do justice to this place when youre down at water level you know just a huge push of water coming through apparently tonnes every second coming through that crack there this is very hostile water for the local fishermen with their methods its not gonna be easy to fish here if youre fishing nets or long lines that kind of fishing involves getting in the water often there are crocs in here this water is very strong so this could be the only kind of gear that might stand a chance here ive got to watch my footing if i fall in ill be sucked to the bottom of this churning water in seconds crocs are hard to see in the water at the best of times but the foam produced by the falls gives them the perfect cover this could be my most dangerous fishing location yet anything takes that bait - its a large bait - its gonna be a serious size fish so one thing ive got to really be aware of is i dont want to be pulled in here oh fish on went a bit slack then but the waters moving around so much its gone in some of the water thats coming towards me it feels a good size because its actually coming with the current its coming up to the surface coming up to the surface thats a good size fish gosh thats a good size its actually going with the current its just stopped there it is on the top on the top on the top i think the fish is tired but theres a real weight of water behind it its right in the side here its right in the side right in the side its tired out i cant see the fish cos theres all that foam how about that how about that right ive just put a bit of heavy mono through its mouth what im gonna do - pull it back into the water walk it round here into some quiet water where it can recover where i can recover as well im just hoping if theres crocs theyll prefer the fish to me its already starting to get a bit more strength back but i want to make sure its fully recovered before i have a look if it goes back in this water not properly recovered its just gonna get bashed possibly to death on these rocks im gonna need the help of my boat driver as this fish is too big to lift by myself its 120ibs with the net - weve got to deduct a little bit for that - but thats well clear of 100ibs ok and then up ok right this is one lump of a nile perch well over 100ibs and what an amazing setting to catch it from big old fish ambush predator great big paddle of a tail there but at the business end look at this - you dont have tentacles like a catfish youve got big eyes then youve got this protrusible jaw when it actually opens that quickly its almost telescopic and it just engulfs fish by creating a vacuum - the water just rushes in and one other thing just to say - look at that for a defence its like having six-inch nails sticking out your back finally ive caught the fish that shows monster nile perch can still be found here in africas rift valley nice to see it go back oh tell you what though if i was a fish i would not like to live in this water some of the other stuff in here particularly the crocodiles also the sheer strength of this water but what a dramatic setting to catch a fish like that on this journey ive had to fish some of the scariest places ive ever been to but ive put my life on the line faced the monsters and caught a giant in what is almost certainly the oldest and most dangerous fishing spot in the world,the nile perch lates niloticus also known as the african snook goliath perch african barramundi goliath barramundi giant lates or the victoria perch is a species of freshwater fish in family latidae of order perciformes it is widespread throughout much of the afrotropical realm being native to the congo nile senegal niger and lake chad volta lake turkana and other river basins it also occurs in the brackish waters of lake maryut in egypt the nile perch is a fish of substantial economic and food-security importance in east africa originally described as labrus niloticus among the marine wrasses the species has also been referred to as centropomus niloticus common names include african snook victoria perch a misleading trade name as the species is not native to lake victoria though they have been introduced there and many local names in various african languages such as the luo name mbuta or mputa in tanzania it is called sangara sankara or chenku in francophone african countries it is known as capitaine its name in the hausa language is giwan ruwa meaning water elephant description l niloticus is silver in color with a blue tinge it has distinctive dark-black eyes with a bright-yellow outer ring one of the largest freshwater fishes it reaches a maximum length of nearly m ft in weighing up to kg lb mature fish typically range from m ft in ft in although many fish are caught before they can grow this large adult nile perch occupy all habitats of a lake with sufficient oxygen concentrations while juveniles are restricted to shallow or nearshore environments a fierce predator that dominates its surroundings the nile perch feeds on fish including its own species crustaceans molluscs and insects the juveniles also feed on zooplankton nile perch use schooling as a mechanism to protect themselves from other predators invasive species nile perch have been introduced to many other lakes in africa including lake victoria and the artificial lake nasser the world conservation unions invasive species specialist group considers l niloticus one of the worlds worst invasive species the state of queensland in australia levies heavy fines on anyone found in possession of a living nile perch since it competes directly with the native barramundi which is similar and grows to m ft in long while the nile perch grows to m ft in long the species is of great commercial importance as a food fish the nile perch is also popular with sport anglers as it attacks artificial fishing lures and it is also raised in aquaculture lake victoria introduction the introduction of this species to lake victoria is one of the most cited examples of the negative effects alien species can have on ecosystems the nile perch was introduced to lake victoria in east africa in the 1950s and has since been fished commercially in nile perch sales to the eu reached million euros sport-fishing in the region of uganda and tanzania provided additional income from tourism its introduction was ecologically disruptive and is attributed with causing the extinction or near-extinction of several hundred native species with some populations fluctuating with commercial fishing and the actual nile perch stocks the nile perch initially fed on native cichlids but with decreasing availability of this prey it now consumes mainly small shrimp and minnows the alteration of the native ecosystem had disruptive socioeconomic effects on local communities bordering the lake many local people have been displaced from their traditional occupations in the fishing trade and brought them into the cash economy or before the establishment of export-oriented fisheries turned them into economic refugees at least initially nets strong enough to hold adult nile perch could not be manufactured locally and had to be imported for a high price the introduction of nile perch has also had additional ecological effects on shore native cichlids were traditionally sun-dried but because nile perch have a high fat content higher than cichlids they need to be smoked to avoid spoiling this has led to an increased demand for firewood in a region already hard-hit by deforestation soil erosion and desertification the academy award-nominated documentary darwins nightmare by hubert sauper a french-austrian-belgian production deals with the damage that has been caused by nile perch introduction including the import of weapons and ammunition in cargo planes from europe which are then used to export nile perch further exacerbating conflict and misery in the surrounding regions regardless of whether it is considered positive or negative the trophic web of lake victoria appears to have been drastically impoverished by the introduction of this novel near-top-level predator while the ecosystem seems to be moving towards a new equilibrium neither its former state nor the state of fisheries on lake victoria can ever easily be brought back threats despite being a successful invasive species the fish faces threats being a species of megafauna the most obvious threats to the species are overfishing and the use of illegal fishing gear as well as invasive water hyacinths prey depletion is also a factor as it decreases the size of the fish and makes it vulnerable to larger predators such as crocodiles export in the uganda fish processors and exporters association called on the parliament to ban the local consumption of the species so as to protect its export religion nile perch were involved with the worship of neith as a result nile perch were sometimes mummified a deposit of several thousand mummified perch was excavated in an area to the west of esna where there was a temple to neith mummified perch have also been found at gurob near a temple to neith while perch statuettes have been found at sais again in the context of a temple to neith see also nile tilapia a similar-named but different fish that is much

out of nowhere giant crocs attack from beneath hippos maul you to death and rival gangs will kill you for your catch but the rewards of fishing here can be spectacular there are reports of rare but very real giants living here so ive decided to head to one of the deadliest fishing spots in the world as it may be my last chance to catch this massive river monster this could be my most dangerous mission yet thunder rumbles im jeremy wade ive made my name investigating improbable fishermens tales from around the world and tracking down the bloodthirsty river monsters that lie behind them but theres one place ive heard of where the death rate for fishermen apparently exceeds all others its the birthplace of mankind*****************the rift valley in east africa formed by two continental plates pulling apart its a monumental scar spanning several countries and containing a series of lakes and rivers i want to find out just how dangerous it is to fish out there but i also want to catch the giant at the heart of this region the mputa or nile perch is africas largest freshwater fish and its the reason fishermen here have been putting their lives at risk for millennia just one animal can feed an entire village this fish can apparently reach weights in excess of 400ibs and measure over 6ft long they are ambush predators and they will eat anything they can fit in their mouths*****************cannibalising nile perch up to a third of their own size giants like this used to be caught regularly but as in so many parts of the world population pressures have led to over-fishing i thought all the big ones had long gone but just a few months ago i received some pictures that suggest there are monster nile perch still out there so ive travelled to the heart of africa to the white nile in uganda - the site of that extraordinary catch im actually now fishing in the very spot where the largest ever nile perch which was accurately weighed was caught on a rod and line this fish weighed just slightly under 250ibs and was almost*****************long unfortunately though that fish was attacked by a crocodile and it didnt survive its wounds so that fish is no longer in this river but its quite possible there could be others the same size or maybe even bigger hmm im just going to tighten it that was uh something definitely hit that bait but it wasnt it wasnt particularly confident it ripped a couple of feet and then and then stopped oh ive got a circle oh here we go yeah there is a fish on if i could get this ratchet off the lines coming up thats a nile perch - its a good size one there it is in this part of the nile the*****************is to land fish quickly before the crocs come looking for easy prey its a decent size nile perch and a great start to my quest for a giant now this is quite an unusual capture it actually swallowed the bait fish head-first down to about here i think it was actually this dorsal barb of the bait fish that actually stopped the bait coming out of its throat not the hook lets just oh lets just support it maybe like that look at that lets get down ok very nice fish - 70ibs something like that but a beautiful fish lovely beautiful colouration very strong as well the paddle-like tail and muscular body indicate a fish designed for*****************and acceleration these fish are ambush predators relying on their large eyes to target prey and just a cavernous mouth on this thing it just inhales its food fish whole ive got to let this fish recover before i let it go and that means exposing myself to a potential croc attack but out here in the middle of the river its my only option what i want now is one that weighs maybe three times that encouraged by my success and aware there could be even bigger monsters on the prowl i decide to head downstream for my next cast as the commotion of that catch could have spooked everything close by but as im travelling i see*****************heavily fortified barrier in the water that confirms that crocs are a very real problem here - this is protection from something in the water - it is like a crocodile these villagers risk their lives simply collecting their days supply of water this is a serious barrier and its pretty solid theres not much in the way of spaces between there that is to stop crocodiles taking people when theyre collecting water so this is a very definite sign the people here take them very seriously on this piece of river have people been killed by crocodiles yeah it was a local fisherman who lost his life and apparently this is not uncommon nile crocodiles are thought to*****************hundreds of people every year making them responsible for more fatal attacks on humans than lions bears and sharks combined maybe i was a bit foolhardy holding that fish in the water the locals certainly dont seem to be taking any chances but its not just creatures in the water i have to look out for the weather is extreme and can turn in a matter of minutes a bit of a storm can sometimes get the fish stirred up get them feeding but looking at all the lightning im not sure holding a conducting rod up in the air in the middle of this is a very good idea so if they dont feed its not gonna be*****************much of a disappointment storms in this part of the world are sudden and brutal in fishermen drowned when their boat capsized in a storm just a few hours away from here so i decide to bring in my line weve got torn away from our mooring on the bank soaked through if were not careful we could become the next deathly statistic but as quickly as it started the storm stops im just hoping it hasnt ruined my chances trouble with rain is if its heavy you just get all this rubbish coming off the land and colouring the water and if youre fishing for a sight predator like the nile perch you can forget it luckily ive*****************a bit of a clear patch next to the bank but its colouring up as i speak you know if more run-off comes from the land or if it rains more it could just put an end to the fishing for me reel unwinds could this be the catch that proves truly giant nile perch are still out there - that is definitely a fish - thunder rumbles the troubles is over there theres a big storm coming in with lightning coming down the storm seems to have swung back around and this is exactly what i didnt want my carbon fiber rod in the air like a lightning conductor as the wind picks up an incredible people are*****************by lightning strikes worldwide every year and uganda is known for having the highest frequency of thunder storms anywhere in the world thats a catfish but looks to be quite a good size ive got to land this fish before the storm returns thats actually ok i was after a nile perch but thats a nice size catfish this one is uh a semutundu catfish its missing a bit of its tentacle here but uh totally different from the nile perch long body shape its a predator as well you can see the muscle blocks clear on the side catfish are right at home in the muddy water with their strong sense of smell and ability to sense movement*****************the murk its probably not much of a surprise i caught one of these rather than a nile perch right get this back in the water very quickly then i think weve got to run for it thunder rumbles oh i dont want to be caught in another lethal storm besides this river is rapidly turning to mud theres no way ill be catching a sight feeder like the nile perch for at least a few days so i decide to head up the white nile to its source at lake victoria this is lake victoria one of the biggest bodies of freshwater anywhere in the world but its also a place where i hear they are still catching*****************perch in some quantity it seems like a calm and tranquil lake but my complacency is about to be rocked if i was in any doubt that i had come to a dangerous region to fish then seeing the body of a fisherman driven off in a makeshift ambulance confirms that this could be my most dangerous mission yet this just goes to show just how regular accidents are with the fishermen just came down to the lake and theres police here been called in because a body has been recovered on the side of the lake its quite hard to establish what happened but it sounds like this was a fisherman who couldnt swim and somehow ended up*****************the water this is a very big body of water its like fishing the sea out here so in a way its not surprising and people go out in very flimsy boats just another example of the dangers and also how common accidents can be maybe the fisherman got caught up in the storm that i just avoided its pretty sobering to see how little fuss his death has caused but in this place its a wonder any fisherman survives the deadly predators or the raging waters and if im not careful i could be the next body they drag out of the water despite the risks ive got to stick to my goal proving that there are still*****************mputa or nile perch out here and that i can survive catching them where they live in the oldest and perhaps most dangerous fishing region in the world ive come to lake victoria in the african rift valley to prove that there are still monster mputa or nile perch out here however in the late 1950s they were introduced to create an industry for the surrounding countries and in just a few decades they took over out-competing the native fish species and reaching enormous sizes as they were without any real natural predators this fish was apparently 340ibs but it was caught some five years ago and the locals havent seen anything as big since however with the lake*****************square miles there could still be some giants that have stayed hidden this is an inlet of lake victoria here they are actually catching nile perch and not just a few its serious serious quantities this boat is just full of them just one after another after another but none of them are the giants that im after a quick chat reveals that this ice boat collects the fish netted by a fleet of some small fishing vessels this is fishing on an industrial scale this boats been out for three days apparently and theres three to four tonnes of fish in here thats a lot of fish ive been invited behind closed factory doors to see the nile*****************industry in action it provides thousands of jobs to the area and it earns over 200m in revenue every year this is the reason truly giant nile perch as so rare these days so apparently theres about 10-12 tonnes of processed fish leaving this factory every day which is you know a huge amount i mean quite mind-boggling particularly when you consider its a freshwater fish well certainly impressive quantity of fish coming out of the lake but one thing that really struck me is that the the big ones are just really few and far between just trying to do a bit of the maths and i reckon id have to plough through something like fish that size*****************have even half a chance of getting something half decent so im gonna have to try and find a place where they dont have such intensive commercial harvesting i decide to head further up the rift valley to ethiopia as the fishing there is far from industrial in fact its still conducted in much the same way that it has been for tens of thousands of years and the nile perch has always been the ultimate prize ethiopia is one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world this is the birthplace of mankind the home of lucy ardi and many of the so-called missing links but there are also traces of the very first fishermen here at*****************ethiopian national museum ive been allowed access behind the scenes at the museum and in this very room are some of the oldest human remains anywhere in the world but what im looking at at the moment are some of the earliest ever fishing implements its fairly clear that these were used for fish because in the same place were found remains of fish they found a skull there just the skull was 3ft long so the whole fish 7ft 8ft something like that so whoever was using these harpoons here could have been after some fairly interesting fish back then im overwhelmed to be this close to the earliest tools of my trade it turns out that this*****************belonged to a giant mputa or nile perch it looks like this modern-day monster has been a valued prize for thousands of years the ancient egyptians revered nile perch for the amount of food they could provide they even mummified these sacred fish and entombed them with their dead its no wonder theres a huge industry harvesting these fish today but if i want to catch one then i need to head to the spots that are hardest to reach where the fishing is so dangerous the locals wont even attempt it maybe heres where ill find my giant these are the headwaters of the biue nile in ethiopia from here this water will go a couple of thousand*****************all the way to the mediterranean there are two main branches of the nile river i started my search on the ugandan white nile but this is the biue nile and nile perch are found along its entire length these falls are known locally as tis isat which translates as the water that smokes the mist has made these rocks incredibly slippery if i fall into this swirling water i could be swept downstream too fast to be rescued theres definitely no commercial fishing here so maybe at these falls ill catch my monster theres a fish there is a oh its off that was a fish that was a a knock then a tighten then i felt something*****************there ill just wind it up and see i cant actually see any signs there tooth marks or anything like that but there was definitely something on there i think i should lob that out again asap i continue fishing for another few hours but whatever that was lurking in this pool it seems to have been spooked and it didnt feel like the giant im after so i decide to move on i head south to another lake as i hear big mputa are the villagers target species fishing techniques here have remained pretty much the same for thousands of years maybe if i leave my hi-tech equipment behind for now and join these fishermen theyll share their*****************of where they catch their fish this is lake chamo in africas rift valley just looking around today even in the st century this place has the look of somewhere that could hold a real serious monster lake chamo is in the south of the ethiopian rift valley and it is known for the size of the beasts that live here and these beasts arent just fish i generally scout out an area before i fish but on this lakeside im not alone and im not sure i like it im not used to jostling for position with man-eaters these guys can eat up to half their own body weight in a single meal and very often its fishermen*****************end up on the menu its situations like this that make you rethink your place on the food chain im normally the person doing the hunting but im very aware now that im having to look around watch my back something might have its eye on me im feeling a little bit more relaxed now rustling theres crocs still in some of these reeds here didnt actually see the animal but heard the movement as it went through the reeds it seems like the big nile perch are only going to be found where the dangers are high im hoping to get some survival advice from a group of fishermen camped out on the lakes shore speaks local language*****************why is it off the ground why have you got it raised up off the ground speaks local language one reason its off the ground is just to keep them dry but theres also just a real menagerie of animals thats active at night they say even pythons will come and snuggle up to you if youre lying on the ground just last year a man was nearly killed by a 13ft python he only escaped by using his cellphone to raise the alarm so you actually live here all the year round it very much is you know a very hardcore way of life this it is set apart from the rest of society but i think quite*****************few people here have got rather shady pasts and they cant really go back so that explains why they do live on the edges this very basic existence and putting up with the very real dangers that go with this way of life its a fairly lawless society down here by all accounts and im not exactly comfortable in their presence apparently some of these men are wanted by the police for crimes that include murder this man tells me that not long ago he was out fishing with a friend when he was attacked by a rival gang conflict like this has been going on for centuries shouting they stole his nets and boats and apparently he was*****************to escape alive the dangers here come at you from all directions im honoured but a little uneasy when these fishermen on the fringe invite me to join their meal so is this tilapia tilapia little bit of spice tilapia are a small fish that they commonly target as they are easier to catch than the nile perch ah clears throat very good sushi tilapia actually not bad mm thank you i realise that if im to fish here i really need to know the risks ill be facing what about the dangers on the lake ive seen the hippos ive seen the crocodiles is this something that you worry about every day speaks local language most of these*****************the hippos and the crocs will be close to the shore thats the dangerous area so what they do they deploy their nets out in the middle of the lake in the deeper water but theyve still got to go through the shallows on their way and on their way back but they say even so there are people whove worked with them in the past who have been killed by both hippos and by crocs despite their lumbering looks many consider hippos africas most dangerous animal as they often kill fishermen this man knows just how real that danger is he was attacked by a hippo just a few months ago while on his way to the lake*****************fish for nile perch speaks local language he was walking with nets along a path and then he noticed a hippo when he saw the hippo he called out and his friend ran off at that point the hippo charged him the next thing that happens is that the hippo is goring him in the side of the chest screaming the hippo has these two sharp tusks on the lower jaw apparently it was spearing him with these tusks and in the process of that flipped him over onto his back he basically just thought he was going to die and he was praying for it to stop praying that he would survive somehow speaks local language it appeared*****************his prayers had been answered because the hippo stopped goring him and started moving off towards the lake towards the water shortly after that his friend came back and found him what injuries were you left with after this can you show your this horrific wound on the chest here - apparently there were three ribs broken with bits of rib actually visible sticking out likewise the wounds on the leg - there was a flap of skin hanging out for me it just really underlines just what a dangerous job this is what a dangerous place this is to be a fisherman i mean i can scarcely begin to imagine what its like working as a fisherman on*****************lake but if i want to learn how they catch the mputa im going to have to fish like they do so i head out with one of the guys to check their nets but i hadnt counted on their boats being so flimsy and exposed this is a bit nerve-wracking theres a pod of hippos over there its not them im worried about but theres a couple of others on the fringes of the group which periodically go under then come back up again and theyve been coming back up closer and closer im trying to get to the deep water cos thats gonna be safer than the shallows where the hippos and crocs are hippos very very*****************looking this way going underwater i dont like the look of this actually after what ive just heard i want to stay well clear of these hippos they are just as dangerous in the water and they have been known to flip boats chomping the occupants to death if i get on the wrong side of a hippo especially in this tiny canoe ill be lucky to escape alive but my only option is to just get on with it if like the local fishermen you are dependent on the fish you catch to stay alive youve got to work with the dangers bit of a ropey old net this looks like a few crocs and hippos have actually*****************through this its good having something to do while im out here rather than just drifting the thought of whats down there - the crocs and the hippos down there oh theres a fish already so this is a tilapia this is what the fishermen mostly catch - what they catch in numbers in these lakes and they dont run to a great deal bigger than this spiny dorsal fin lovely blue-ish colouration there yeah just very pretty but the reason theyre catching them is they are very very good eating which is whats gonna happen to this one the rest of the net doesnt yield any more fish let alone a nile perch but apparently they are out*****************and they are the prize that makes facing the unseen dangers worthwhile the fishermen on this lake are proving to be some of the bravest people ive met however in his pursuit of fish this guy has pushed his luck to the limit speaks local language this is actually quite a story hed earlier seen a crocodile in this area and what hed done hed thrown stones at the crocodile to make it go away he just saw the crocodile sink he assumed then that it was safe to go in the water screams that crocodile grabbed him by the left leg what crocodiles do they try and pull you into deeper water to drown you thats how they*****************you before they then dismember you later on speaks local language but the crocodile actually then got tangled in the net and the fisherman was able to actually come free of the crocodiles jaws but you said there were two times another time also a crocodile attack the second time was two years later deploying the net and as hes paying out the net he felt something go like that on his toe this was a crocodile standing on his right foot at that point hes thinking here we go again he managed to half get on the boat right leg on the boat and then the crocodile came along and grabbed his left leg again one tooth of*****************crocodile went in his leg because the boat was in the way the crocodile couldnt get a good grip on him so eventually the crocodiles grip slipped and he was able to escape im thinking this is a very lucky guy he probably doesnt feel hes lucky to have this happen twice but the fact hes escaped twice from the jaws of crocodiles that is absolutely impressive for anybody im really glad i dont have to earn my living fishing from this lake and the one that attacked you same size as this i reckon that croc must be about 15ft long and close to 1000ibs fishermen here have a lot to be afraid of so its no wonder*****************religion plays such an important part in their lives this spectacular rock-hewn church is devoted to the patron saint of ethiopia a man famous for doing battle with an almighty river monster a giant dragon this is bete giyorgis the church of st george this place literally is breathtaking to think this is actually just one solid lump of rock i mean its just a huge sculpture really just incredible this is a classic picture of st george on his horse the dragon lying dead or dying on the ground speaks local language its very very clear from here that so important is he to the people here that there are even people who believe that this story of*****************river monster this dragon might have been well this is the classic picture of st george on his horse dragon slain on the ground and the princess the maiden looking on very very detailed rendition of the dragon its got pretty nasty-looking teeth a forked tongue and these wings with little claws almost on the edge of the wings it seems like the dragon is a composite of all the most deadly animals that are found here in the african rift valley even my nile perch is represented by the wings of this beast the continuing strength of this legend underlines how the people here have been battling creatures in the water for generations and they love a hero who can defeat them i come across one man who took on perhaps the most feared animal here when he was attacked by a crocodile however this time the croc didnt*****************empty-handed not only did the crocodile make off with his foot it had done so much damage to his lower leg that his leg was actually amputated above the knee unbelievably he still fishes as this picture here proves he still goes out with just one leg fishing in the very same lake where he had that encounter he has a family to feed so he has to keep facing the dangers but hes not fished this long without learning a thing or two so this tilapia in the picture very interesting he actually used that as live bait for nile perch he knows where the nile perch are he could tell me possibly the places to go and*****************the places to avoid i think this could be a very useful lead after a discussion of tactics with this fearless fisherman i head back out onto lake chamo armed with some inside information about good places to try but to get to them i have to pass a point known as the crocodile market so-called because its a favourite spot for these lake giants to gather apparently the largest nile crocodile ever recorded lived on this lake - a beast about 20ft long and that was only a few years ago seeing this many crocodiles hauled out in the sun makes me realise just how many man-eating sized monsters are living in this lake just the size of*****************of these creatures - just enormous ive never seen so many big crocodiles in one place before and as they sink back into the water i can understand why they say its the croc you dont see that will kill you but for now ive got a more immediate problem as again out of nowhere the wind has suddenly picked up the waves have risen and the water has muddied i think if ever theres a deadly place to fish either on rivers or in the sea this is it well this boat is metal theres no inherent buoyancy at all if this develops a leak its going straight down and theres 20ft crocs in here only a prize*****************big as a nile perch makes facing these risks worthwhile so i push on hoping that ill catch my prey before i become the prey like the old man suggested im using a tilapia as bait itll work better than an artificial lure because the waters very cloudy but the weather here is beating me this is actually not working were being blown so fast were just dragging that behind us its not actually drifting after a few hours getting bashed around by the waves i head into shore for a break basically all the gear on both boats ive got two boats one for me one for equipment and safety but everything just battered around and soaked so*****************come into a bit of shelter here downwind of a peninsula that runs out into the lake and letting everything dry but we came past a net and when we came onto the shore a couple of fishermen paddled round in a boat with a sack and erm im just gonna see whats in the sack actually oh i thought that might be a few in there - thats just one fish its a nile perch not so easy to recognise when its just the meat but actually you can see the shape of the fish from this fillet very deep bodied white flesh some red muscle on the outside but very prized for its eating looking at that*****************tail is going to end about here the head is about here which translates into a fish thats sort of 3ft-4ft long so im guessing thats gonna be a good 50ibs something like that do you catch on a hook or nets speaks local language so fairly industrial fishing methods about 70-80 yard long net and going down about 6-7ft so that was put out last night they checked it today and this was the result one fish but a very nice sized one speaks local language apparently this was caught from an area near here where the bottom is quite rocky thats quite a good sign because everywhere ive been to so far the bottom has been very*****************very level its interesting that this fish was caught in a place where theres a little bit of underwater ups and downs i try my luck at the spot they mentioned a rocky outcrop in the lee of an island nile perch love having cover to ambush their prey from and the underwater ridge here could be perfect for them but despite fishing here for several hours nothing takes over the next few days i fish a variety of locations but it just seems that either the fish arent here or others have gotten here first so this net is definitely designed to catch nile perch looks like ive got some serious competition here eventually i have to admit*****************this lake is defeating me ive seen how determined the fishermen are here and theyve been harvesting these lakes for thousands of years im beginning to wonder if the nile perch here have been over-fished too its disappointing having to leave these lakes without having caught anything ive seen plenty of monsters but not the one i want if i stayed long enough i might catch something but life is too short for that i think im gonna have to go to one of the other rift valley lakes i have no choice but to head to a place that is truly out of reach of fishermen not only is it illegal to keep fish that are caught here*****************few local fishermen are willing to test its spectacular natural defences this is murchison falls in uganda ive seen how people in the rift valley fish some pretty extreme dangerous water conditions but i cant imagine anybody fishing here so im thinking that maybe at the bottom of these falls could be the place where im gonna catch my monster nile perch the water at the bottom of these falls is known as the devils cauldron and its where im about to meet my river monster on this journey to catch africas largest freshwater fish ive faced deadly monsters encountered fearless fishermen who have courted death and ive braved storms and lethal conditions in what is surely one of*****************most deadly places in the world to be a fisherman shouting yet the giant at its heart has so far eluded me as i make my way up to the falls my anticipation is mounting im just approaching what looks like smoke there but that is the spray that is being thrown up by the murchison falls the thought of the size of some of the fish that are down in this churning water you know starting to get a bit of a flutter its really quite frightening the thought of hooking a big fish in this water this could be my best and perhaps last chance of catching a monster this big eddy behind me is called the*****************cauldron now that sounds very melodramatic very over the top but words almost dont do justice to this place when youre down at water level you know just a huge push of water coming through apparently tonnes every second coming through that crack there this is very hostile water for the local fishermen with their methods its not gonna be easy to fish here if youre fishing nets or long lines that kind of fishing involves getting in the water often there are crocs in here this water is very strong so this could be the only kind of gear that might stand a chance here ive got to watch my footing if i fall in ill be sucked*****************the bottom of this churning water in seconds crocs are hard to see in the water at the best of times but the foam produced by the falls gives them the perfect cover this could be my most dangerous fishing location yet anything takes that bait - its a large bait - its gonna be a serious size fish so one thing ive got to really be aware of is i dont want to be pulled in here oh fish on went a bit slack then but the waters moving around so much its gone in some of the water thats coming towards me it feels a good size because its actually coming with the current its coming up*****************the surface coming up to the surface thats a good size fish gosh thats a good size its actually going with the current its just stopped there it is on the top on the top on the top i think the fish is tired but theres a real weight of water behind it its right in the side here its right in the side right in the side its tired out i cant see the fish cos theres all that foam how about that how about that right ive just put a bit of heavy mono through its mouth what im gonna do - pull it back into the water walk it round here into some quiet water where*****************can recover where i can recover as well im just hoping if theres crocs theyll prefer the fish to me its already starting to get a bit more strength back but i want to make sure its fully recovered before i have a look if it goes back in this water not properly recovered its just gonna get bashed possibly to death on these rocks im gonna need the help of my boat driver as this fish is too big to lift by myself its 120ibs with the net - weve got to deduct a little bit for that - but thats well clear of 100ibs ok and then up ok right this is one lump of a nile*****************well over 100ibs and what an amazing setting to catch it from big old fish ambush predator great big paddle of a tail there but at the business end look at this - you dont have tentacles like a catfish youve got big eyes then youve got this protrusible jaw when it actually opens that quickly its almost telescopic and it just engulfs fish by creating a vacuum - the water just rushes in and one other thing just to say - look at that for a defence its like having six-inch nails sticking out your back finally ive caught the fish that shows monster nile perch can still be found here in africas rift valley nice to see*****************go back oh tell you what though if i was a fish i would not like to live in this water some of the other stuff in here particularly the crocodiles also the sheer strength of this water but what a dramatic setting to catch a fish like that on this journey ive had to fish some of the scariest places ive ever been to but ive put my life on the line faced the monsters and caught a giant in what is almost certainly the oldest and most dangerous fishing spot in the world,the

piranha,red bellied piranha,pygocentrus nattereri,piranha legends tell of the most ferocious fish in world with razor-sharp teeth they hunt in packs stripping a body of its flesh in minutes they have a reputation for killing and eating humans literally being stripped of all the flesh only the boots were left but it may not be justified i dont think the reputation of piranhas as bloodthirsty monsters is deserved at all im jeremy wade biologist and extreme angler and my mission is to find out if piranhas really are the ultimate horror of the amazon all they said that they saw was just a turbulence in the water of the piranhas devouring the child i remember a story from the 70s of a bus crashing into the amazon river in brazil the people inside were eaten alive by piranhas horrific stories like this have been circulating since the discovery of south america but every single piece of scientific research i found says that piranhas dont kill people so are these stories real or are they just overexaggerated urban myths fish on fish on ive traveled the globe literally putting my life on the line to prove that there are giant man-eating fish where no one would expect them big old mouth on there in our freshwater rivers but now its the turn of the small guys could piranhas really kill and eat a human are they the bloodthirsty killers from the movies that fill our nightmares i visited london zoo to talk to brian zimmerman a piranha expert and assistant curator of the aquarium to see what he thinks theres no documented cases of a living human going into the water and being attacked by a group of piranhas and being reduced to a skeleton in seconds but piranha are carnivorous fish if theyre hungry its certainly possible that they would attack to try to get food i dont see why a human would be any different than an egret falling in the water its just for a piranha its a potential food source but to my knowledge thats never happened so if brian believes piranhas have never attacked and killed a living person then did this bus crash that i remember really take place i decide to head to manaus the city at the heart of the amazon to see if i can get to the bottom of this memory and maybe track down a definite case where piranhas have eaten someone alive and where better to start my investigation than the home of many a gruesome fishermens tale the manaus fish market with over species of fish found in the amazon river more than the entire atlantic ocean theres no shortage of strange-looking river monsters here wicked-looking spines on there such a variety of fish here scientists have determined that there are some different species in the piranha subfamily yet the majority of them are actually vegetarian it is the flesh-eating behavior of just a couple of species that gives them their reputation and its not long before my questions unearth another shocking account that shows just what they are capable of this is a piranha story and old man was left in his floating house by his family just for a couple of hours they came back hed gone there were just his clothes there so you know they thought he must have gone to take a bath or something but he wasnt in sight anywhere they searched they searched eventually they found just his skeleton i mean literally hed gone in the water because he was old he wasnt able to get back out and the piranhas just had him two months ago its another gruesome story but here at the market i cant track down a name or definite location for this fishermans tale im gonna have to search further afield to find an eyewitness to a lethal piranha attack the amazon river is miles long twice the length of the mississippi it is mostly wide and slow-moving but up this distant tributary it is quite the opposite of all the water on earth passes through the amazon and piranhas and their relatives are found in just about all of it its a fishermans paradise and its full of river monsters and theres a fish on theres a fish on oh there it is there it is jumping out of the water thats quite strong thats a strong fish ive hooked a predatory fish with dental hardware straight out of a horror movie so this is a payara its a relative of the piranha it is an arms war down there everythings got teeth everything is eating everything else and theyve actually got those fangs there in the lower jaw and they use those to puncture the swim bladder of the prey so it just messes up the buoyancy the small fish is then totally out of control its flopping around near the surface and these will just come along afterwards and mop them up and those fangs are that big that it has to have special holes in the upper jaw otherwise it wouldnt be able to get its mouth closed so its probably some very precise engineering going on out of sight that we cant see this vampire-like creature shows how evil-looking the piranha family can get but despite its looks it is not the fish responsible for attacking people this is a solitary fish hunter the piranha we all fear feed in packs and they are so common in the amazon you can catch them almost anywhere normally i use high-tech gear and stealthy tactics to lure a monster onto my line but the piranhas method of feeding is so bold that im changing my approach ive dispensed with my normal rod and im just using a bit of bamboo with a short length of line on the end tried-and-tested means of catching piranha just a hook on the end with a piece of wire so they i dont chomp through the line lump of meat and unlike other techniques where youre being quiet and stealthy piranhas are actually attracted by noise and disturbance on the surface oh there we go red-bellied piranha in just a couple of minutes ive caught a small piranha but do not be deceived it still has knife-like teeth that can easily remove a lump of flesh in a single bite multiply that by the hundred or so mouths in a hungry school of piranhas and its a death of a thousand individual cuts a protruding jawbone with large chomping muscles means that when the mouth is closed the triangular teeth from both jaws lock together like a bear trap they are perfectly adapted to slice off pieces of meat fins or scales literally taking apart their prey piece by piece they predominantly hunt fish but they will eat the meat of almost any animal that crosses their path and in this river with almost every cast im catching a piranha this river is just absolutely full of piranhas theyre just all over the place doesnt mean to say though that i cant do this surely swimming in a piranha-infested river is suicide this water may be full of piranhas but theyre not attacking me if i can swim here and its true that the old man from the fish-market story and the victims of the bus crash were eaten alive then something is missing that is needed to trigger a feeding frenzy still alive theres plenty of water here im guessing theres enough food for them down there without them wanting to attack me so what about if i set something up where i know there are plenty of piranhas and i know that theyre hungry welcome to my piranha pool here at a local hotel just like my favorite bond villain ive filled a small swimming pool with over red-bellied piranhas and they havent eaten for days its the perfect opportunity to test just how voracious these creatures are everybody knows about sharks being bloodthirsty killers just wondering if piranhas have the same kind of sensitivity to blood piranhas have evolved to live in the murky sediment-filled waters of the amazon where visibility is often less than a foot so a good sense of smell to locate their next meal is surely essential thats definitely getting a reaction theres a number of fish have come into that cloud of blood and theyre looking around they want something to chew into but theres nothing there at the moment i think time to put a bit of flesh in there for them so blood is definitely whetting their appetite and there would have been blood in the water from those injured by the impact of the bus crash now i wonder how these piranhas will react to a bloody piece of prime steak there we go its the first nibble first nibble first nibble and there they are theyre all piling in once the first one started there we go all over piranhas react to the sound and movement of another piranha feeding attracting them to the scene and inciting a feeding frenzy as soon as one piranha takes a bite it moves away allowing a fast turnover of feeders and a rapid succession of bites its no wonder they are known for stripping their food to the bone in just minutes there we go meat definitely works i just wanted to know how they might react to something thats alive these piranhas were tearing into a piece of dead meat just a couple of minutes ago but they are just not interested in me so what is it that turns piranhas into vicious murderous killers that is what i want to try and find out if the story of the bus crash is true then presumably just like my piranha pool there was human flesh blood and a mass of hungry piranhas yet i am unharmed to people on the bus werent so lucky as i continue my investigation i discover the evidence to prove that the bus crash definitely happened but more significantly i tracked down a survivor who had an unbelievable escape on that day maybe he can give me the details of exactly what happened so i can work out what triggers a piranha attack ive come to the amazon to find out if piranhas are the bloodthirsty killers of myth or if the truth is a little more complicated ive managed to unearth a newspaper report from the 1970s that describes the exact bus crash that i remember where some of the passengers were eaten by piranhas it reports that on the 14th of november the bus was traveling from manaus to the town of itacoatiara a journey of about five hours after driving through the night it crashed into a tributary of the amazon killing passengers the newspaper also mentions the name of a survivor dirceu araujo ive managed to track him down to find out what he can remember from that fateful day as this might allow me to pass judgment on the guilt or otherwise of the piranha dirceu tells me he was sitting at the very rear of the bus and like the rest of the passengers he had been sleeping for most of the journey on board that day were several families a couple of students named alex and ivan as well as many other men and women returning to their homes in itacoatiara not long before the accident the bus went through a pothole waking dirceu up this he tells me could well have saved his life this is the very spot where the accident happened the bus came down here went in the river down there dirceu doesnt not know if the brakes failed or if the bus skidded but the driver had done the same route several times that day the papers at the time reported the suggestion that he fell asleep and at the ferry crossing carried straight on into the river one minute everythings normal literally the next moment its in the water there were people crying wailing much despair there were people at the front trying to open the door by pulling it hes basically saying that you know that door only opens if you push then the water the water started to come in at which point he went back to where hed been seated there was a boy there whod been trying to break the window and he saw actually saw dirceu saw this boys foot disappearing out of the bus and he saw the foot followed it managed to get himself out through the same hole hes just about clear of the bus somebody grabbed hold of his leg can you imagine somebody is trying to grab hold of his leg while he is trying to escape and get to the surface actually had to kick this persons hand off to get free from the bus and actually you know escape from the wreck people remained trapped on the bus and didnt survive in the panic of his escape dirceu doesnt remember seeing any piranhas so no one knows how long it was after the bus submerged that the piranhas attacked even to this day just going over the bridge which theyve got now over the river he says every time he crosses he just remembers that day it was several hours before rescuers could winch the bus out of the water by that time it was far too late for any remaining passengers there were three children and one baby actually all from the same family they were brought up dead there was one body there had literally been stripped of all the flesh only the boots were left the impact piranhas have on a human body is distinct and may be too shocking for some viewers to see these horrific images from recent cases arriving at the manaus city morgue show just what a piranha is capable of doing and the type of wounds it leaves exposed flesh and soft tissue are removed first which is exactly what dora di barbossa witnessed when she arrived on the scene as the bodies were being extracted from the bus she told me that some of the victims were brought out still hugging each other and her story made me truly realize what it meant to lose someone in this crash dora was just years old at the time of the tragedy and what happened she was living in itacoatiara and she just actually started her nurse training at the time and so she actually went to the river of the site of the accident hmm thats pretty tragic dora says she did know some of the people on the bus which just makes it sort of extra extra horrific really there was the husband of the teacher of hers and she says that his face was completely eaten away down not down to the bone but down to cartilage and also a lad called ivan who she liked very much this was her childhood sweetheart and he was one of the victims as well and she said that because of this she found it very difficult early on to talk about this whole business but as a result of this she said she actually you know left the area and didnt return for a while because of the memories of the place just like the testimonies from the bus crash the morgue pictures leave us in no doubt as to the horrors piranhas can inflict on a human body but as the bus crash happened years ago its impossible to know if the victims died of the wounds inflicted by the piranhas or if they were already dead we know that on the bus they were trapped there was blood in the water and people were eaten by piranhas but did the piranhas attack and eat their victims alive or did they merely scavenge the corpses of those who had already drowned so even though i have found my bus crash the case against the piranha still hangs in the balance my quest to investigate the bloodthirsty reputation of the piranha is still unresolved although piranhas have without doubt fed on dead human flesh im yet to find proof that they have killed a living human maybe brian zimmerman was right i dont think the reputation of piranhas as bloodthirsty monsters is deserved at all piranha are just animal that is trying to survive in the wild when they happen to be a carnivorous fish yet in flooded water bodies like this scientists have discovered that there are double the number of piranhas than normal and this has led to a situation where their innocence is once again in question all over brazil dams like this have created artificial lakes which are very popular places to come for a swim particularly in the heat of the dry season put that together with a concentrated population of piranhas and youre asking for trouble humans being attacked by man-eating fish is the stuff of nightmares and it has fueled an industry of fear which hollywood has happily embraced if youre on a beach by the ocean sharks can be a very real concern its not uncommon to enter the water with a fear of what might lurk beneath but deep inland over a thousand miles from the sea most people would not expect to be a victim yet on the weekend of december the 21st at the end of the dry season this is exactly what happened on a beach exposed by the seasonal low water eight people were attacked and the perpetrators of these attacks were piranhas in a period of seven months people were bitten by piranhas unlike the bus crash these werent frenzied attacks which left the corpses half eaten these were individual bites no one was trapped injured or bleeding yet the piranhas were definitely attacking live people obviously something strange had occurred here ive come to one of these artificial lakes created by a dam to find out whats going on and to see what kind of piranhas are living here all this used to be rainforest but when the water rose the trees all died just leaving this weird landscape there we go theres a knot theres something on there right here we go here we go here we go thats a sizable fish thats a piranha but that is a big piranha now this is something ive got to be very careful with careful careful careful careful careful and there it is imagine swimming with these boys in the water oh crunch oh crunching on the hook as i take it out how about that for a piranha this is a black piranha its the biggest species of piranha look at those teeth look at those teeth im being extremely careful here they just have such powerful jaws and that would take a serious size lump out of you literally the size of that jaw that would be the size of the hole that youd be missing those teeth are so sharp that when people get cut by them they say they dont even feel it when it happens they only notice it when they see the blood it was these kinds of attacks single bites that were being made at the beach but again brians theory that piranhas are misunderstood has an explanation piranha tend to build their nests in very shallow areas because they need to have vegetation not only for the eggs to stick to but also for the young fry to retreat when theyre first hatching so in cases where people have been bitten i mean i suppose somebody wading in shallow water and happens to tread onto the nest of a piranha where theres a big male defending its eggs is definitely gonna be susceptible to getting a bite the beach attacks occurred when there were most people in the water on the hottest days of the end of the dry season it is at this point usually just after the first rains when piranhas breed all they were doing was simply what most living creatures do protecting their young so these multiple piranha attacks actually reveal a caring animal that in this instance has no intention to kill piranha are very nervous fish we were involved in a study recently which was looking at the reasons for shoaling behavior in piranha and the study actually found that instead of them being pack hunters and living together in groups because theyre trying to hunt their prey they actually live in shoals to avoid predators themselves and its like a case of safety in numbers if piranhas group together because of their mortal fear of another river monster then this is a creature i need to meet piranhas may enjoy a reputation as evil killers but here in the amazon they are far from the top of the food chain this river is a supremely predatory environment and im told that there are wild river monsters that come here to be fed by locals these creatures are highly adapted killers and greatly feared by the piranhas and once again im the guinea pig that is entering the water to meet them dolphins who would have thought it thousand miles from the ocean right up the amazon river freshwater dolphins and these guys i mean theyre are having fun now but my goodness theyve also got a dark side were in the middle of a frenzy that one bit my thumb that one got my thumb oh dear hey and these are the guys that take out piranhas little bit eager a little bit eager the jaw very very long and elongated full of teeth just perfect for grabbing fish wow theyve also got this really strange bulging head and thats actually oop and echolocation organ a lot of these waters in the amazon are very murky and they cant see their prey but even in that situation they can find and kill their prey ohh using sonar ohh-hoo-hoo you know youve got to be very very careful tangling with these creatures time for me to get out i think the amazon is the most predator-filled waterway on the planet everything kills or is killed ive spent years fishing this river and i know it is crammed full of the meanest nastiest creatures perhaps piranhas are not unusual they just get singled out for attention because they capture our imagination but that still doesnt explain what triggers their attacks its strong and heavy look at this a new species for me i know the species but ive never never never caught one theres a lump taken out of it by piranha they can tell when a fish is in distress and they go after it you can actually see the shape here of a piranha jaw something chomped this fish on the way in you know normally these fish are paying complete attention to not ending up on the menu this one basically thinking about something else for just a moment and a piranha came and chopped it so youve literally got to watch your back this armored catfish was a fantastic catch but seeing the piranha bite on its back has crystallized everything for me this fish lives in and amongst piranha every day of its life yet struggling on the end of my line it instantly became a target it is the thrashing struggle of distress that triggers the piranhas natural instincts to target the weak and helpless this explains why i can swim and splash around with piranhas yet the struggle for life in the bus crash initiated the piranhas predatory instincts its sobering to think of what happened to those poor passengers that day as they traveled back to their hometown their lives were never meant to cross with piranhas yet for thousands of people in the amazon life is literally lived on the water with such huge seasonal variations in water level entire villages float on the river and theres one whose very name suggests the reality they deal with on a daily basis this place is known as the piranha reserve ive come here to find out what life is like living with the constant threat of piranhas these people are known as ribeirinhos or river people almost everything they need is sourced from or around the amazon river lets see if the piranha reserve lives up to its name and what kind of piranhas they have here the line is flat on the surface there it goes red-bellied there we go whoop now right you can see why people i couldnt do that if i didnt have shoes on you can see why so many people here are missing bits out of their toes every one of these is a red-bellied i mean this ones got slight spots on it as well but that just means its a juvenile again again here we go theres almost more fish than water every single chuck out comes a red-bellied piranha theyre not very big but my goodness there are just loads of them down here ive heard all these stories about piranhas being capable of skeletonizing bodies literally within moments or minutes ive got this freshly killed duck here from the market and i think its time to put those stories to the test its apparent that the sound the thrashing of a distressed animal is what attracts them so just a little bit of movement to start them honing in right theyre in there theyre in there already i just saw a flash of silver with very distinctive red as well right theyre starting to arrive now once one finds it basically you know that just kicks the whole thing off look at that doing the head there theyve already just stripped all the flesh from the spine flip this in and have a look oh right from the back this didnt look too bad but actually flip it over the side where the fish were and theyve made a real mess of that theyve actually chewed through a huge expanse of feather to get at the meat and theyve gone right into the body cavity theyve taken most of the meat away theres a huge section of actually the backbone gone in the neck the head is just reduced to bone both eyes are gone and all this just in a matter of minutes its easy to forget that this is right outside someones front door for the people who live here dealing with the dangers of piranhas on a daily basis is just part of life i visit some of the families who live here to find out how they cope but i discover a story of a piranha attack that chills me to my very bones this remote place is actually called the piranha reserve but what i soon learn is that it is in the dry season when the water is low and the piranhas are concentrated that the villagers are most at risk it is a particular time of year its principally the months of september and october here you cant even get in the water to have a wash the main food item here is fish so there you are you have to clean the fish in order to prepare it for the meal and just the smell of that will bring a concentration of piranhas there so you got to be careful keep your fingers nowhere near the water but on one occasion this family dropped their guard with horrific consequences it was a grandson of julios theyre saying you know you cant look after kids all the time his wife was cleaning some fish off the back of the house and the child just ran as children do from one side of the house to the other and fell in the water at the other side and he said literally they heard a noise they got there it was already too late the child fell in the water and just didnt come up all they said that they saw was just a turbulence in the water of the piranhas devouring the child just literally moments after the child had fallen off the side of the boat with nets they were trying to sort of retrieve the child even while this was going on and eventually he said all they got in was bones when i asked how long it took he said no this happened very rapidly because you know there are just you know so many so many piranhas here this is what id been searching for a firsthand account of piranhas attacking killing and eating a human in this case a 3-year-old boy who the grandfather preferred not to name yet the reality of hearing a story like this takes away all feelings of success i might have had its one thing to hear the myth of piranhas but i mean you know its quite something else to talk to somebody whos actually seen the truth of that with their own eyes if you consider that this is just one of hundreds or even thousands of similar isolated settlements found all along the amazon who knows how many more cases remain unreported these lads are just theyre just balancing on pieces of wood about that wide ive just heard this horrific story about somebody falling into this water and getting just devoured in seconds and they dont even seem bothered by it much as we might live with the ever-present threat of a lethal highway on our doorstep these people continue their lives within feet of deadly piranhas i guess like a lot of things you know living in a floating house like this with these piranhas underneath after a while its just there its just automatic you just get used to it there are just precautions that you take you cant be thinking about it all the time if you were you just wouldnt be able to get on with your life its just this ever-present presence underneath and all around you i set out on this journey to find an eyewitness to a piranha attack in the hope that their evidence might give me the proof i needed to know if the bloodthirsty reputation of the piranha is justified ive found that piranhas are sometimes shy sometimes defensive and they are somewhat misunderstood but if you have a very specific combination of the right time of year blood the struggle of distress and a trapped or weakened person you will trigger a piranha feeding frenzy in a river full of monsters this is just a natural adaptation to life here in the amazon but no water what the piranha will continue to evoke fear and horror in each and every one of us,the red-bellied piranha also known as the red piranha pygocentrus nattereri is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family serrasalmidae which includes the pacus piranhas and related fishes the red-bellied piranha occurs in south america found in the amazon paraguay parana and essequibo basins as well as coastal rivers of northeastern brazil this fish is locally abundant in its freshwater habitat they are carnivorous foragers and feed on insects worms crustaceans and fish opportunistic feeders as they are will also take advantage of edible aquatic plants as well as any fruits nuts or seeds that may fall into the waters they are not a migratory species but do travel to seek out conditions conducive to breeding and spawning during periods of increased rainfall red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense but rarely exhibit group hunting behavior acoustic communication is common and is sometimes exhibited along with aggressive behaviors they are a popular aquarium fish etymology the fish is named after johann natterer taxonomy and phylogeny the red-bellied piranha belongs to the family serrasalmidae which is a group of medium to large-sized characids and includes other closely related omnivores such as pacus they are characterized by deep lateral compressed bodies and long dorsal fins within the family red-bellied piranhas are classified in the genus pygocentrus which is distinguished by the unusual dentition and differing head width dimensions the red-bellied piranha is often thought of as highly carnivorous while most other fish that are not piranhas in the family are primarily herbivorous however the red-bellied piranha is actually omnivorous distribution and habitat the red-bellied piranha is distributed widely throughout the south american continent and is found in the neotropical rivers of argentina brazil bolivia colombia ecuador guyana paraguay peru uruguay and venezuela they live in the warm freshwater drainages of several major rivers including the amazon paraguay parana and essequibo as well as numerous smaller systems they can live in waters that are between and c f but are able to survive temperatures as low as c f for a period they are mainly found in whitewater but have also been recorded in blackwater and clearwater the red-bellied piranha live in major rivers streams lakes such as oxbows and artificial lakes formed by dams floodplains and flooded forests they were introduced to china probably by the aquarium trade first detected in they have since become invasive in the country no piranha is found in the united states including this one in a single specimen was found in a lake in a golf course in simi valley ventura county california california and washington prohibit p nattereri and encourage surveillance to prevent its introduction description the red-bellied piranha has a popular reputation as a ferocious predator despite being primarily a scavenger as their name suggests red-bellied piranhas have a reddish tinge to the belly when fully grown although juveniles are a silver color with darker spots the species can reach up to kg lb oz in weight and cm in in standard length but rarely surpass cm in the rest of the body is often grey with silver-flecked scales sometimes blackish spots appear behind the gills and the anal fin is usually black at the base the pectoral and pelvic fins may vary from red to orange females can be distinguished from males by the slightly deeper red color of their bellies the red-bellied piranha is typically found in white water rivers such as the amazon river basin and in some streams and lakes sometimes they may inhabit flooded forests such as those found in the brazilian amazon they live in shoals but do not group hunt although they may occasionally enter into feeding frenzies in the case of a feeding frenzy schools of piranha will converge on one large prey individual and eat it within minutes these attacks are usually extremely rare and are due to provocation or starvation breeding occurs over a two-month period during the rainy season but that can vary by area females will lay around eggs on newly submerged vegetation in nests that are built by the males a significant amount of lore regarding the ferocity of the red-bellied piranha can be traced to president theodore roosevelt following the completion of the roosevelt-rondon scientific expedition the former president returned with dramatic stories of an entire cow being devoured to the bones within a matter of a few minutes this event was later found to be staged by local guides eager to provide roosevelt with a spectacle worthy of the journey it later surfaced the fish had been corralled and starved for over a week into a section of the river into which the unfortunate cow was driven for the event there is nothing to suggest roosevelt was ever aware of this fact behavior pygocentrus nattereri encompasses a larger geographic area than any other piranha species covering much of the neotropical region when red-bellied piranhas are introduced to other parts of the american continent there are usually negative consequences for the local fish fauna partially due to its generally aggressive behavior this aggressive behavior is sometimes marked by the acoustic sounds they produce the red-bellied piranha is not a migratory species but does search for conditions conducive to reproduction during seasons of increased rainfall red-bellied piranhas are omnivores and primarily foragers they feed on insects fish plants and organic debris bechara et al finds p nattereri is almost immune to gas bubble disease which is devastating to almost all fish in the same environment diet and feeding behavior the typical diet of red-bellied piranhas is omnivorous including fruit leaves insects mollusks carrion and fish in packs up to hundreds piranhas have been known to feed on animals as large as egrets or capybara despite the piranhas reputation as a dangerous carnivore it is actually primarily a scavenger and forager and will mainly eat plants and insects during the rainy season when food is abundant they also tend to feed only on weak injured dying or dead animals in the wild red-bellied piranhas do not stay in groups in order to pack-hunt for larger animals but instead group for protection against predators foraging methods vary throughout the different stages of a piranhas life smaller fish will search for food during the day while larger fish will forage at dawn in the late afternoon and in the early evening throughout the day the fish lurk in dark areas and ambush their prey the piranha may also catch prey by hunting and chasing where it will lie hidden in the vegetation until its prey swims by the piranha will then capture its prey when scavenging the piranha will eat a wide variety of food ranging from pieces of debris insects snails fish fins scales and plants reproduction the breeding habits of piranhas in nature are mostly unknown with most spawning research being done in aquariums piranhas are usually able to breed by the time they are one year old female piranhas will lay several thousand eggs near water plants onto which the eggs stick the males then fertilize the eggs after just two to three days the eggs will hatch and the juvenile piranhas will hide in the plants until they are large enough to defend themselves at which point hiding from predators becomes lurking for prey research on red-bellied piranha breeding behavior in nature has revealed certain behavioral patterns around nesting sites adult piranhas will swim side-by-side in small circles sometimes with two individuals swimming in opposite directions while keeping their ventral surfaces close to one another although this may appear to be a courtship display a closer look reveals that the adults are actually defending nesting sites the nests are about to centimetres to in deep and are dug among water grasses with the eggs attached to the grasses and plant stems this formation of mating pairs nuptial swimming displays and guarding of the nests shows that red-bellied piranhas exhibit parental care for the nest and the young when left unattended other fish such as characids may prey upon the eggs despite the defensive practice of circling the nests red-bellied piranhas are often passive toward other fish that approach the nest it is possible that the mere presence of the piranha a natural predator provides enough of a threat to prevent potential predators from approaching the nest piranhas have two annual reproductive seasons these seasons are tied to water level fluctuations the flooding pulse temperature and other hydrological conditions when individuals are ready to become sexually active they will lose their red coloration and select habitats that are conducive to spawning such as flooded marginal grasses and vegetation within lakes this habitat selection is a clear distinction from non-reproductive individuals that prefer open water and under floating meadows shoaling red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense as well as for the offense in studies that tested the piranhas reactions to a simulated predator attack resting opercular rates returned to normal more quickly among piranhas that were in shoals of eight rather than in shoals of two although it has been presumed that piranhas engage in pack-hunting behavior no investigation shows that shoaling behavior among piranhas is used for cooperative hunting most likely this shoaling behavior is a defense against predation from larger animals such as dolphins large piscivorous fish caimans and aquatic birds such as storks herons and anhingas piranhas will travel to their nesting sites in shoals in order to reduce the likelihood that any single individual will be attacked by a predator shoals of red-bellied piranha use the margins of flooded areas to build their nests communication and signaling acoustic communication among red-bellied piranhas is exhibited along with aggressive behaviors such as biting chasing conspecific confrontation and fighting the sounds created by piranhas are generated through rapid contractions of the sonic muscles and is associated with the swimbladder the swimbladder may play an important role in sound production as a resonator all of the observations made on sound production by red-bellied piranha have been when specimens were held by hand when taken out of the water the red-bellied piranha will emit a drumming-like sound consisting of a low-frequency harmonic sound however research has shown the presence of three types of acoustic emissions that are associated with specific behaviors type one calls are made up of harmonic sounds last approximately milliseconds at hz and are associated with frontal display behavior between two fish type two sounds last approximately milliseconds at hz and are associated with circling and fighting behavior related to food competition type three sounds are made up of a single pulse lasting just milliseconds at hz and are highly associated with chasing behavior toward a conspecific individual this same sound is also produced when an individual snaps its jaws to bite another individual nearly all sounds produced by red-bellied piranhas are produced in the context of social interactions between individuals the low drumming sounds are typically produced during moderate attacks while loud threatened sounds are produced during more vigorous attacks conservation status the red-bellied piranha is widespread and locally abundant in some parts of its range it is among the most common fish species the collection and trade of the species to aquariums may locally present a low risk to the red-bellied piranha in the media many myths surround this species the film piranha by joe dante shows these fish in a similar light to sharks in jaws piranha was followed by a sequel piranha ii the spawning in and two remakes one in and piranha 3d in which also got a sequel of its own piranha 3dd films such as these and stories of large schools of red-bellies attacking humans fuel their exaggerated and erroneous reputation as being one of the most ferocious freshwater fish in reality they are generally timid scavengers fulfilling a role similar to vultures on land in piranha 3d a previously unknown piranha is discovered christopher lloyds character misidentifies a specimen of this monstrous new species as the familiar pygocentrus nattereri in aquariums red-bellied piranhas are sometimes kept as aquarium fish they may be fed live fresh or frozen food but they will not eat rotten meats their natural diet consists of live prey and dead animals or fish live feedings to captive piranhas can introduce diseases and goldfish contain a growth-inhibiting hormone which in turn will affect piranhas red-bellied piranhas particularly when juvenile will sometimes bite one another in the aquarium normally on the fins in behavior called fin nipping those that have had their fins nipped will grow them back surprisingly rapidly to maintain a piranha aquarium it is important to keep the water quality up as they are messy eaters and this will dirty the water in the tank also they need places to hide in dim light because in the wild they may not eat every day those in captivity do not need to be fed daily but when hungry they can eat each other references external links media related to pygocentrus nattereri

killing and eating humans literally being stripped of all the flesh only the boots were left but it may not be justified i dont think the reputation of piranhas as bloodthirsty monsters is deserved at all im jeremy wade biologist and extreme angler and my mission is to find out if piranhas really are the ultimate horror of the amazon all they said that they saw was just a turbulence in the water of the piranhas devouring the child i remember a story from the 70s of a bus crashing into the amazon river in brazil the people inside were eaten alive by piranhas horrific stories like this have been circulating since the discovery of south america but every single*****************of scientific research i found says that piranhas dont kill people so are these stories real or are they just overexaggerated urban myths fish on fish on ive traveled the globe literally putting my life on the line to prove that there are giant man-eating fish where no one would expect them big old mouth on there in our freshwater rivers but now its the turn of the small guys could piranhas really kill and eat a human are they the bloodthirsty killers from the movies that fill our nightmares i visited london zoo to talk to brian zimmerman a piranha expert and assistant curator of the aquarium to see what he thinks theres no documented cases of a*****************human going into the water and being attacked by a group of piranhas and being reduced to a skeleton in seconds but piranha are carnivorous fish if theyre hungry its certainly possible that they would attack to try to get food i dont see why a human would be any different than an egret falling in the water its just for a piranha its a potential food source but to my knowledge thats never happened so if brian believes piranhas have never attacked and killed a living person then did this bus crash that i remember really take place i decide to head to manaus the city at the heart of the amazon to see if i can get*****************the bottom of this memory and maybe track down a definite case where piranhas have eaten someone alive and where better to start my investigation than the home of many a gruesome fishermens tale the manaus fish market with over species of fish found in the amazon river more than the entire atlantic ocean theres no shortage of strange-looking river monsters here wicked-looking spines on there such a variety of fish here scientists have determined that there are some different species in the piranha subfamily yet the majority of them are actually vegetarian it is the flesh-eating behavior of just a couple of species that gives them their reputation and its not long before my questions unearth another shocking*****************get back out and the piranhas just had him two months ago its another gruesome story but here at the market i cant track down a name or definite location for this fishermans tale im gonna have to search further afield to find an eyewitness to a lethal piranha attack the amazon river is miles long twice the length of the mississippi it is mostly wide and slow-moving but up this distant tributary it is quite the opposite of all the water on earth passes through the amazon and piranhas and their relatives are found in just about all of it its a fishermans paradise and its full of river monsters and theres a fish on theres a fish on oh there it is there it is jumping out of the water thats quite strong thats a strong fish ive hooked a predatory fish with dental hardware straight out of*****************horror movie so this is a payara its a relative of the piranha it is an arms war down there everythings got teeth everything is eating everything else and theyve actually got those fangs there in the lower jaw and they use those to puncture the swim bladder of the prey so it just messes up the buoyancy the small fish is then totally out of control its flopping around near the surface and these will just come along afterwards and mop them up and those fangs are that big that it has to have special holes in the upper jaw otherwise it wouldnt be able to get its mouth closed so its probably some very precise engineering going*****************out of sight that we cant see this vampire-like creature shows how evil-looking the piranha family can get but despite its looks it is not the fish responsible for attacking people this is a solitary fish hunter the piranha we all fear feed in packs and they are so common in the amazon you can catch them almost anywhere normally i use high-tech gear and stealthy tactics to lure a monster onto my line but the piranhas method of feeding is so bold that im changing my approach ive dispensed with my normal rod and im just using a bit of bamboo with a short length of line on the end tried-and-tested means of catching piranha just a hook*****************the end with a piece of wire so they i dont chomp through the line lump of meat and unlike other techniques where youre being quiet and stealthy piranhas are actually attracted by noise and disturbance on the surface oh there we go red-bellied piranha in just a couple of minutes ive caught a small piranha but do not be deceived it still has knife-like teeth that can easily remove a lump of flesh in a single bite multiply that by the hundred or so mouths in a hungry school of piranhas and its a death of a thousand individual cuts a protruding jawbone with large chomping muscles means that when the mouth is closed the triangular teeth from*****************jaws lock together like a bear trap they are perfectly adapted to slice off pieces of meat fins or scales literally taking apart their prey piece by piece they predominantly hunt fish but they will eat the meat of almost any animal that crosses their path and in this river with almost every cast im catching a piranha this river is just absolutely full of piranhas theyre just all over the place doesnt mean to say though that i cant do this surely swimming in a piranha-infested river is suicide this water may be full of piranhas but theyre not attacking me if i can swim here and its true that the old man from the fish-market story and*****************victims of the bus crash were eaten alive then something is missing that is needed to trigger a feeding frenzy still alive theres plenty of water here im guessing theres enough food for them down there without them wanting to attack me so what about if i set something up where i know there are plenty of piranhas and i know that theyre hungry welcome to my piranha pool here at a local hotel just like my favorite bond villain ive filled a small swimming pool with over red-bellied piranhas and they havent eaten for days its the perfect opportunity to test just how voracious these creatures are everybody knows about sharks being bloodthirsty killers just wondering if piranhas*****************the same kind of sensitivity to blood piranhas have evolved to live in the murky sediment-filled waters of the amazon where visibility is often less than a foot so a good sense of smell to locate their next meal is surely essential thats definitely getting a reaction theres a number of fish have come into that cloud of blood and theyre looking around they want something to chew into but theres nothing there at the moment i think time to put a bit of flesh in there for them so blood is definitely whetting their appetite and there would have been blood in the water from those injured by the impact of the bus crash now i wonder how*****************if they were already dead we know that on the bus they were trapped there was blood in the water and people were eaten by piranhas but did the piranhas attack and eat their victims alive or did they merely scavenge the corpses of those who had already drowned so even though i have found my bus crash the case against the piranha still hangs in the balance my quest to investigate the bloodthirsty reputation of the piranha is still unresolved although piranhas have without doubt fed on dead human flesh im yet to find proof that they have killed a living human maybe brian zimmerman was right i dont think the reputation of piranhas as bloodthirsty monsters is deserved at all piranha are just animal that is trying to survive in the wild when they happen to be a carnivorous fish yet in flooded water bodies like this scientists*****************discovered that there are double the number of piranhas than normal and this has led to a situation where their innocence is once again in question all over brazil dams like this have created artificial lakes which are very popular places to come for a swim particularly in the heat of the dry season put that together with a concentrated population of piranhas and youre asking for trouble humans being attacked by man-eating fish is the stuff of nightmares and it has fueled an industry of fear which hollywood has happily embraced if youre on a beach by the ocean sharks can be a very real concern its not uncommon to enter the water with a fear of what*****************individual bites no one was trapped injured or bleeding yet the piranhas were definitely attacking live people obviously something strange had occurred here ive come to one of these artificial lakes created by a dam to find out whats going on and to see what kind of piranhas are living here all this used to be rainforest but when the water rose the trees all died just leaving this weird landscape there we go theres a knot theres something on there right here we go here we go here we go thats a sizable fish thats a piranha but that is a big piranha now this is something ive got to be very careful with careful careful careful careful careful and there it is imagine swimming with these boys in the water oh crunch oh crunching on the hook as i take it out how about that for a piranha*****************is a black piranha its the biggest species of piranha look at those teeth look at those teeth im being extremely careful here they just have such powerful jaws and that would take a serious size lump out of you literally the size of that jaw that would be the size of the hole that youd be missing those teeth are so sharp that when people get cut by them they say they dont even feel it when it happens they only notice it when they see the blood it was these kinds of attacks single bites that were being made at the beach but again brians theory that piranhas are misunderstood has an explanation piranha tend to build*****************hottest days of the end of the dry season it is at this point usually just after the first rains when piranhas breed all they were doing was simply what most living creatures do protecting their young so these multiple piranha attacks actually reveal a caring animal that in this instance has no intention to kill piranha are very nervous fish we were involved in a study recently which was looking at the reasons for shoaling behavior in piranha and the study actually found that instead of them being pack hunters and living together in groups because theyre trying to hunt their prey they actually live in shoals to avoid predators themselves and its like a case of safety in numbers if piranhas group together because of their mortal fear of another river monster then this is a creature i need to meet piranhas may enjoy a reputation as evil*****************but here in the amazon they are far from the top of the food chain this river is a supremely predatory environment and im told that there are wild river monsters that come here to be fed by locals these creatures are highly adapted killers and greatly feared by the piranhas and once again im the guinea pig that is entering the water to meet them dolphins who would have thought it thousand miles from the ocean right up the amazon river freshwater dolphins and these guys i mean theyre are having fun now but my goodness theyve also got a dark side were in the middle of a frenzy that one bit my thumb that one got my*****************oh dear hey and these are the guys that take out piranhas little bit eager a little bit eager the jaw very very long and elongated full of teeth just perfect for grabbing fish wow theyve also got this really strange bulging head and thats actually oop and echolocation organ a lot of these waters in the amazon are very murky and they cant see their prey but even in that situation they can find and kill their prey ohh using sonar ohh-hoo-hoo you know youve got to be very very careful tangling with these creatures time for me to get out i think the amazon is the most predator-filled waterway on the planet everything kills or is killed*****************spent years fishing this river and i know it is crammed full of the meanest nastiest creatures perhaps piranhas are not unusual they just get singled out for attention because they capture our imagination but that still doesnt explain what triggers their attacks its strong and heavy look at this a new species for me i know the species but ive never never never caught one theres a lump taken out of it by piranha they can tell when a fish is in distress and they go after it you can actually see the shape here of a piranha jaw something chomped this fish on the way in you know normally these fish are paying complete attention to not*****************up on the menu this one basically thinking about something else for just a moment and a piranha came and chopped it so youve literally got to watch your back this armored catfish was a fantastic catch but seeing the piranha bite on its back has crystallized everything for me this fish lives in and amongst piranha every day of its life yet struggling on the end of my line it instantly became a target it is the thrashing struggle of distress that triggers the piranhas natural instincts to target the weak and helpless this explains why i can swim and splash around with piranhas yet the struggle for life in the bus crash initiated the piranhas predatory instincts*****************sobering to think of what happened to those poor passengers that day as they traveled back to their hometown their lives were never meant to cross with piranhas yet for thousands of people in the amazon life is literally lived on the water with such huge seasonal variations in water level entire villages float on the river and theres one whose very name suggests the reality they deal with on a daily basis this place is known as the piranha reserve ive come here to find out what life is like living with the constant threat of piranhas these people are known as ribeirinhos or river people almost everything they need is sourced from or around the amazon river*****************see if the piranha reserve lives up to its name and what kind of piranhas they have here the line is flat on the surface there it goes red-bellied there we go whoop now right you can see why people i couldnt do that if i didnt have shoes on you can see why so many people here are missing bits out of their toes every one of these is a red-bellied i mean this ones got slight spots on it as well but that just means its a juvenile again again here we go theres almost more fish than water every single chuck out comes a red-bellied piranha theyre not very big but my goodness there are just*****************of them down here ive heard all these stories about piranhas being capable of skeletonizing bodies literally within moments or minutes ive got this freshly killed duck here from the market and i think its time to put those stories to the test its apparent that the sound the thrashing of a distressed animal is what attracts them so just a little bit of movement to start them honing in right theyre in there theyre in there already i just saw a flash of silver with very distinctive red as well right theyre starting to arrive now once one finds it basically you know that just kicks the whole thing off look at that doing the head there theyve*****************just stripped all the flesh from the spine flip this in and have a look oh right from the back this didnt look too bad but actually flip it over the side where the fish were and theyve made a real mess of that theyve actually chewed through a huge expanse of feather to get at the meat and theyve gone right into the body cavity theyve taken most of the meat away theres a huge section of actually the backbone gone in the neck the head is just reduced to bone both eyes are gone and all this just in a matter of minutes its easy to forget that this is right outside someones front door for the*****************is a particular time of year its principally the months of september and october here you cant even get in the water to have a wash the main food item here is fish so there you are you have to clean the fish in order to prepare it for the meal and just the smell of that will bring a concentration of piranhas there so you got to be careful keep your fingers nowhere near the water but on one occasion this family dropped their guard with horrific consequences it was a grandson of julios theyre saying you know you cant look after kids all the time his wife was cleaning some fish off the back of the house and the child just ran as children do from one side of the house to the other and fell in the water at the other side and he said literally they,the red-bellied piranha also known as the red piranha pygocentrus nattereri is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family serrasalmidae which includes the pacus piranhas and related fishes the red-bellied piranha occurs in south america found in the amazon paraguay parana and essequibo basins as well as coastal rivers of northeastern brazil this fish is locally abundant in its freshwater habitat they are carnivorous foragers and feed on insects worms crustaceans and fish opportunistic feeders as they are will also take advantage of edible aquatic plants as well as any fruits nuts or seeds that may fall into the waters they are not a migratory species but do travel to seek out conditions conducive to breeding and spawning during periods of increased rainfall red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense but rarely exhibit group hunting behavior acoustic communication is common and is sometimes exhibited*****************with aggressive behaviors they are a popular aquarium fish etymology the fish is named after johann natterer taxonomy and phylogeny the red-bellied piranha belongs to the family serrasalmidae which is a group of medium to large-sized characids and includes other closely related omnivores such as pacus they are characterized by deep lateral compressed bodies and long dorsal fins within the family red-bellied piranhas are classified in the genus pygocentrus which is distinguished by the unusual dentition and differing head width dimensions the red-bellied piranha is often thought of as highly carnivorous while most other fish that are not piranhas in the family are primarily herbivorous however the red-bellied piranha is actually omnivorous distribution and habitat the red-bellied piranha is*****************widely throughout the south american continent and is found in the neotropical rivers of argentina brazil bolivia colombia ecuador guyana paraguay peru uruguay and venezuela they live in the warm freshwater drainages of several major rivers including the amazon paraguay parana and essequibo as well as numerous smaller systems they can live in waters that are between and c f but are able to survive temperatures as low as c f for a period they are mainly found in whitewater but have also been recorded in blackwater and clearwater the red-bellied piranha live in major rivers streams lakes such as oxbows and artificial lakes formed by dams floodplains and flooded forests they were introduced to china probably by the*****************trade first detected in they have since become invasive in the country no piranha is found in the united states including this one in a single specimen was found in a lake in a golf course in simi valley ventura county california california and washington prohibit p nattereri and encourage surveillance to prevent its introduction description the red-bellied piranha has a popular reputation as a ferocious predator despite being primarily a scavenger as their name suggests red-bellied piranhas have a reddish tinge to the belly when fully grown although juveniles are a silver color with darker spots the species can reach up to kg lb oz in weight and cm in in standard length but rarely surpass cm in*****************rest of the body is often grey with silver-flecked scales sometimes blackish spots appear behind the gills and the anal fin is usually black at the base the pectoral and pelvic fins may vary from red to orange females can be distinguished from males by the slightly deeper red color of their bellies the red-bellied piranha is typically found in white water rivers such as the amazon river basin and in some streams and lakes sometimes they may inhabit flooded forests such as those found in the brazilian amazon they live in shoals but do not group hunt although they may occasionally enter into feeding frenzies in the case of a feeding frenzy schools of piranha will converge on*****************large prey individual and eat it within minutes these attacks are usually extremely rare and are due to provocation or starvation breeding occurs over a two-month period during the rainy season but that can vary by area females will lay around eggs on newly submerged vegetation in nests that are built by the males a significant amount of lore regarding the ferocity of the red-bellied piranha can be traced to president theodore roosevelt following the completion of the roosevelt-rondon scientific expedition the former president returned with dramatic stories of an entire cow being devoured to the bones within a matter of a few minutes this event was later found to be staged by local guides eager to provide roosevelt*****************a spectacle worthy of the journey it later surfaced the fish had been corralled and starved for over a week into a section of the river into which the unfortunate cow was driven for the event there is nothing to suggest roosevelt was ever aware of this fact behavior pygocentrus nattereri encompasses a larger geographic area than any other piranha species covering much of the neotropical region when red-bellied piranhas are introduced to other parts of the american continent there are usually negative consequences for the local fish fauna partially due to its generally aggressive behavior this aggressive behavior is sometimes marked by the acoustic sounds they produce the red-bellied piranha is not a migratory species but does search*****************conditions conducive to reproduction during seasons of increased rainfall red-bellied piranhas are omnivores and primarily foragers they feed on insects fish plants and organic debris bechara et al finds p nattereri is almost immune to gas bubble disease which is devastating to almost all fish in the same environment diet and feeding behavior the typical diet of red-bellied piranhas is omnivorous including fruit leaves insects mollusks carrion and fish in packs up to hundreds piranhas have been known to feed on animals as large as egrets or capybara despite the piranhas reputation as a dangerous carnivore it is actually primarily a scavenger and forager and will mainly eat plants and insects during the rainy season when food is abundant*****************also tend to feed only on weak injured dying or dead animals in the wild red-bellied piranhas do not stay in groups in order to pack-hunt for larger animals but instead group for protection against predators foraging methods vary throughout the different stages of a piranhas life smaller fish will search for food during the day while larger fish will forage at dawn in the late afternoon and in the early evening throughout the day the fish lurk in dark areas and ambush their prey the piranha may also catch prey by hunting and chasing where it will lie hidden in the vegetation until its prey swims by the piranha will then capture its prey when scavenging the piranha*****************eat a wide variety of food ranging from pieces of debris insects snails fish fins scales and plants reproduction the breeding habits of piranhas in nature are mostly unknown with most spawning research being done in aquariums piranhas are usually able to breed by the time they are one year old female piranhas will lay several thousand eggs near water plants onto which the eggs stick the males then fertilize the eggs after just two to three days the eggs will hatch and the juvenile piranhas will hide in the plants until they are large enough to defend themselves at which point hiding from predators becomes lurking for prey research on red-bellied piranha breeding behavior in nature has revealed*****************behavioral patterns around nesting sites adult piranhas will swim side-by-side in small circles sometimes with two individuals swimming in opposite directions while keeping their ventral surfaces close to one another although this may appear to be a courtship display a closer look reveals that the adults are actually defending nesting sites the nests are about to centimetres to in deep and are dug among water grasses with the eggs attached to the grasses and plant stems this formation of mating pairs nuptial swimming displays and guarding of the nests shows that red-bellied piranhas exhibit parental care for the nest and the young when left unattended other fish such as characids may prey upon the eggs despite the defensive practice*****************circling the nests red-bellied piranhas are often passive toward other fish that approach the nest it is possible that the mere presence of the piranha a natural predator provides enough of a threat to prevent potential predators from approaching the nest piranhas have two annual reproductive seasons these seasons are tied to water level fluctuations the flooding pulse temperature and other hydrological conditions when individuals are ready to become sexually active they will lose their red coloration and select habitats that are conducive to spawning such as flooded marginal grasses and vegetation within lakes this habitat selection is a clear distinction from non-reproductive individuals that prefer open water and under floating meadows shoaling red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals*****************a predatory defense as well as for the offense in studies that tested the piranhas reactions to a simulated predator attack resting opercular rates returned to normal more quickly among piranhas that were in shoals of eight rather than in shoals of two although it has been presumed that piranhas engage in pack-hunting behavior no investigation shows that shoaling behavior among piranhas is used for cooperative hunting most likely this shoaling behavior is a defense against predation from larger animals such as dolphins large piscivorous fish caimans and aquatic birds such as storks herons and anhingas piranhas will travel to their nesting sites in shoals in order to reduce the likelihood that any single individual will be attacked by*****************predator shoals of red-bellied piranha use the margins of flooded areas to build their nests communication and signaling acoustic communication among red-bellied piranhas is exhibited along with aggressive behaviors such as biting chasing conspecific confrontation and fighting the sounds created by piranhas are generated through rapid contractions of the sonic muscles and is associated with the swimbladder the swimbladder may play an important role in sound production as a resonator all of the observations made on sound production by red-bellied piranha have been when specimens were held by hand when taken out of the water the red-bellied piranha will emit a drumming-like sound consisting of a low-frequency harmonic sound however research has shown the presence of three types of*****************emissions that are associated with specific behaviors type one calls are made up of harmonic sounds last approximately milliseconds at hz and are associated with frontal display behavior between two fish type two sounds last approximately milliseconds at hz and are associated with circling and fighting behavior related to food competition type three sounds are made up of a single pulse lasting just milliseconds at hz and are highly associated with chasing behavior toward a conspecific individual this same sound is also produced when an individual snaps its jaws to bite another individual nearly all sounds produced by red-bellied piranhas are produced in the context of social interactions between individuals the low drumming sounds are typically produced during moderate*****************while loud threatened sounds are produced during more vigorous attacks conservation status the red-bellied piranha is widespread and locally abundant in some parts of its range it is among the most common fish species the collection and trade of the species to aquariums may locally present a low risk to the red-bellied piranha in the media many myths surround this species the film piranha by joe dante shows these fish in a similar light to sharks in jaws piranha was followed by a sequel piranha ii the spawning in and two remakes one in and piranha 3d in which also got a sequel of its own piranha 3dd films such as these and stories of large schools of red-bellies*****************humans fuel their exaggerated and erroneous reputation as being one of the most ferocious freshwater fish in reality they are generally timid scavengers fulfilling a role similar to vultures on land in piranha 3d a previously unknown piranha is discovered christopher lloyds character misidentifies a specimen of this monstrous new species as the familiar pygocentrus nattereri in aquariums red-bellied piranhas are sometimes kept as aquarium fish they may be fed live fresh or frozen food but they will not eat rotten meats their natural diet consists of live prey and dead animals or fish live feedings to captive piranhas can introduce diseases and goldfish contain a growth-inhibiting hormone which in turn will affect piranhas red-bellied piranhas particularly when juvenile*****************sometimes bite one another in the aquarium normally on the fins in behavior called fin nipping those that have had their fins nipped will grow them back surprisingly rapidly to maintain a piranha aquarium it is important to keep the water quality up as they are messy eaters and this will dirty the water in the tank also they need places to hide in dim light because in the wild they may not eat every day those in captivity do not need to be fed daily

killer catfish,goonch catfish,bagarius yarrelli,try and catch me in the deep south a monster is accused of a series of violent attacks aah a creature as deadly as a shark and as big as a gator is blamed wherever we have alligator gar there are myths of monsters the state authorities said it should be electrocuted now im on a mission to get face-to-face with this river monster whoo you better be strapped in to find out if this animal really is guilty of the crimes its blamed for im jeremy wade a fisherman and a biologist with a passion for freshwater giants ive traveled the globe putting my life on the line to find truly monster-sized fish its become something of an obsession for me to get into really remote parts of the world and to find the animals that nobody else can but the creatures i hunt and find are not just monsters in size but in attitude too and now im on the trail of one that has a reputation for attacking humans ive heard some alarming stories of this creature over many years but ive never seen one in the flesh its the alligator gar a truly prehistoric monster there are five species of gar that inhabit the united states all gar are ancient fish theyve existed on earth for over million years their survival is in part because of their unique defense system scales made from a super-hard enamel called ganoin this armor plating has seen them survive predatory dinosaurs the alligator gar however is in a class apart named for the profile of its snout its the largest of all gar reaching some feet in length and weighing over pounds it has a further defining characteristic a double row of dagger-pointed teeth along the length of the upper jaw but these attributes have not been enough to defend it against a more modern threat man before their range extended beyond american borders but the impact of people means that now theyre not found above the bootheel of missouri and tennessee alligator gar stand accused of savage attacks on humans ive trawled the archives and all the attacks ive come across are concentrated in the deep south they certainly have the teeth for it but ive been unable to find any hard evidence that these fish are the culprits if im going to find an alligator gar guilty of these crimes im definitely looking for a very big fish the experts ive spoken to suggest texas is the place where the biggest specimens are still to be found im heading directly to the trinity river a 710-mile-long waterway here people have caught gator gar longer than i am tall bigger when you get close isnt it to help me im recruiting bubba bedre hes a specialist in finding alligator gar that weigh over pounds sometimes for food but normally for bow fishermen after trophies but im not planning to catch a fish for a trophy i want to find out if this creature has committed the crimes its accused of bubba is taking me straight to a section of the trinity that he believes holds the best hope of finding large gar what were doing now is were just drifting with the current and weve just come to a a bend in the river that doubles round and bubbas just said this is the hole this is a known haunt and i can imagine the current has actually dug out a bit of a you know a bit of a hole in the bottom here and apparently they are very aware more aware than a lot of fish of sort of knocking and noises in the boat so were literally just drifting with the current and just looking to see if we can see them come up and breach gar have a swim bladder that works like a lung an adaptation that helps them survive in oxygen-poor backwaters and creeks however this brings them up to the surface to breathe its a chink in their armor giving away their presence ooh yes so theyre just theyre just coming up and gulping air and going down yeah that fish there is mad he knows were here yeah exactly do you know when he splashes hard like that id guess assume to spook us off yeah ive come across exactly the same thing in the amazon theres a fish there that comes up and gulps air and if they do it gently they dont know youre there if theyre like that you think oh thats a good fish but it is actually getting up and going down as quickly as it can so its the same behavior the rivers here have murky water with visibility limited gar use a band of highly sensitive vibration receptors along their body called the lateral line this enables them to locate prey and predators to avoid detection we decide to abandon the boat and fish from the shore im still experimenting with baits and im going to start off using a treble hook standard issue for big predatory fish although the waters muddy ive seen several come and break the surface so i know theyre here i know there are fish of 100-pounds-plus you know within a 25-yard radius of my bait you know thats quite a feeling its one of those moments in fishing where things can go from being very quiet like they are at the moment to you know suddenly can have an animal over pounds on the end of your line trying to pull you in the water but if there is a monster gator gar in these texan waters its not giving itself up easily if im to find one that fits the crimes its accused of aah it has to be at least as big as me a real river monster at lake livingston on the trinity river in texas i seek out legendary fisherman bobby fly for some clues on how to find a giant specimen he caught one seven feet long that put him in the hall of fame and he believes there are still big gar around on the trinity you aint got to move your boat yards one way or the other to catch good garfish right there now i have seen one foot long down there garfish oh really mm-hmm i was tied up on top of a willow tree with a 14-foot flat-bottom and this bad boy come right up beside me and just surfaced right there and i seen the front of my boat and the back of my boat and i seen fish all the way so i immediately pulled up the slack undone my rope and went on to the house i didnt hang around but this sighting was in and his record catch was landed in other anglers have pulled out large specimens but no fish over feet in length has been caught in the last decade the big question is are there still any gar left large enough to commit the attacks theyre accused of and if so how will i catch one thats interesting i mean thats a big fierce bobby fly caught his giant using a bait of a carp-like fish called a buffalo and how did you prepare the buffalo to okay you take the buffalo and you want a nice one about oh pounds then you take a mallet and beat him up what like a hammer a mallet well a a little baseball bats what we used and you just whup on him real good and then you take your claws your fingernails and just get its tail and you just strip the fins off yeah and then you cut him up in little bitty squares like 14-inch squares and the blood the reason why you beat on the fish with a mallet is to get that blood all into the meat cause thats what theyre smelling out there they want that blood you just put it on that hook and throw it up there thats all very interesting all i got to do now is go out and try and get something similar-sized something close to that would make me happy i think well you will you will theres some big ones out there you go down there where i told you to go and youll be all right bobby flys optimism about the size of these fish is ringing in my ears but im still unsure whether this fish is as aggressive as its reputation suggests ive heard many stories of these fish attacking humans but one particular incident sticks in my mind a really gruesome report from the neighboring state louisiana try and catch me on a warm humid spring day a 9-year-old schoolgirl elizabeth grainger and her 13-year-old brother george are playing on the shoreline of the lake race you its not fair you always win elizabeth only a few feet away from her brother dangles her feet in the water you always win you always do aah suddenly something grabs hold of her leg aah dr robert b payne has worked as a physician for almost years but he has never seen wounds like this what have we here my goodness the press report georges claim that what attacked his sister was seven feet long and that he believed it to be a garfish in his medical report dr payne describes the wounds as being like coarse needles inserted in a board a wave of paranoia soon follows and the alligator gar is held accountable for many similar attacks although this was a well-documented event the identity of the attacker rested entirely on the testimony of a 13-year-old boy but was an alligator gar really the culprit or with its threatening prehistoric appearance was it just an obvious scapegoat i turn to mark spitzer an expert on the gar youve got a sort of an inch-thick or so is that what you is that the sort the official gar history as far as youve well this is my gar history ive been intensely researching gar for the last few years and you know all over the country wherever we have alligator gar there are myths of monsters these fish were the fishes of nightmares and so i mean one rumor that was created was that these fish eat twice their weight in a day and stuff like that you know and that they attack human beings so i mean were there lots of stories of that kind of nature there was an article that appeared in the new orleans newspaper called alligator gar more dangerous than so-called man-eater shark and heres this is a copy of the article it was written by an anonymous journalist who basically said if you should emerge from swimming or taking a bath and you find out that you have a limb missing do not blame the shark it is probably the alligator gar that did it its where does the fact end and the imagination and and sort of fantasy start the gar can certainly grow to a large size and it has a ferocious armory of teeth but does this prove an inclination to attack humans is it a natural i need to find hard evidence using the advice of fishing legend bobby fly im going for a bait of buffalo fish this i hope will let me get my hands on the alleged culprit but im learning on the job my best hope is to try and get into the mind of the gar ive only been here a very short time and because so few people fish for these fish its a big ugly stupid-looking fish so lets use fairly basic tackle and you know normally its a thick bit of wire some heavy line and a big treble hook i think theyre actually quite sensitive you know you can still you can still be sensitive even if youve got sort of a bogey mouth and i think thick wire they actually they can feel that when theyre chomping on it and i think a treble hook as well you know theres a nice soft succulent bit of fish and theres theres something in there now whats that and i think they can spit it out so im using a single hook and the thing about that it can just fold down nicely its not sticking out like you know three points on it both mark and i cast lines into the river but its the bait on the single hook that gets picked up somethings got it its moving its moving around to the left is it yeah it is i need to let the line run very freely to avoid the fish realizing the baits attached to anything somethings taken off its on the end its stopped its off again hes off again really yeah really its good its the line all right its gonna be very soon yeah oh i think its off aw oh no no no no no its coming toward us thats a small i think its a turtle or a small fish its coming in very easily or its a little gar is that a needle nose look at that greedy thing that greedy thing ah this gator gar has eyes bigger than its stomach but at three feet long its a chance for me to test whether these fish have an aggressive character right they grow inches their first year so its probably you know between a year and two that tongues interesting isnt it yeah theres those two rows of of teeth on the top these teeth are of an inch long of the length of those of a fully grown gator gar unh thats it oh my god you got bit huh i was just in there trying to get the hook out score one for the fish yeah thats a very young alligator gar with a big appetite im just gonna lob him back in the water whoops back in the water my idea that the gar is just a misunderstood big ugly stupid fish has caught me out maybe it does deserve its reputation after all this fish has actually still got a lot of energy left i brought it in on very heavy gear so its actually got a lot of energy left normally theyd be pretty tired out i think im just gonna slide him over the side well ahead of our next fishing spot so here we go back you go even a fish this small has managed to draw blood good battle scars but you can see the sort of the cut on it this is a setback to my theory that the gator gar may have been unfairly blamed for these violent attacks the consequences if this fish were scaled up to a monstrous to feet are beginning to hit home when you think about a gar that size with teeth to match and a body like a torpedo it really is a terrifying prospect youve just got a living weapon of destruction that was just a gentle brush with its teeth okay it wasnt particularly deep but they certainly drew blood whoops back in the water yet this alligator gar is only three feet long aah george grainger reported that what bit his sister was seven feet long and other reports state that these fish can reach double that length now i have seen one foot long down there its reputation for vicious attacks on humans is beginning to appear justified its no wonder that people took fright when you consider a beast of those dimensions with a couple of hundred razor-sharp teeth but i still dont have hard proof i believe the jury is still out in past times for many of those living in the deep south this was a fish guilty as charged one that should be eradicated from all rivers and lakes so they took it really seriously then the whole business of lets clear these things out of the water theyre you know theyre an abomination theyre not fit to sort of share the planet with us they obviously look guilty therefore they must be responsible for these occasional instance where someone gets their leg bitten or whatever but but but wheres the evidence basically they look scary and so that added to people just wanting to run them out of town and so they were run out of town i mean i heard of you know just sort of heaps of them up in the you know yeah bulldozered piles lots of people shooting them just a very despised hated fish in the texas game fish commission began a campaign of extermination they built an electric gar destroyer rigged with a 200-volt electric net to kill the fish over the next three decades millions of gar were destroyed in an effort to be rid of them forever perhaps the prejudice that the alligator gar has always suffered explains the extreme fishing methods used to catch them today unless they get the protection they need to reach full size giant alligator gar may well be wiped out now in texas for the first time the parks and wildlife authorities are trying to work out what the cost has been to the gar population on the lower trinity were en route to set what are called juglines baited hooks attached to floats our plan is to catch as many gator gar as possible and then monitor them with electronic tags dr dave buckmeier leads this project dave whats the state of knowledge on the gar at the moment alligator gar along with other gars and buffalo and things have always been considered kind of rough fish which no one really cared much about is that the same as trash fish trash fish would be another common name for it and so there was actually even efforts to try and eradicate alligator gar and other gars from populations cause they were believed to have eaten desirable fish if you will largemouth bass and things that we have catfish they have recently been listed as vulnerable by the american fisheries society and thats because in most states theyre definitely on the decline yeah so we have some real reasons for concerns about this species shall i chuck this out yeah go ahead throw that one out there and it unwinds itself does it yeah they just as the bait sinks itll unwind and then that lies on the bottom and just right and that lies on the bottom and when the gar come up to feed theyll kind of comb the bottom pick up the bait and usually run with it for minutes and after were confident theyve swallowed it well go pick up the bait its spinning nicely there it looks like its gone to rest not much research has yet been done but its thought few gator gar reach their maximum life-span of years as we move on to set more lines theres a call from the opposite bank of the river weve actually just put out some juglines and nets but some local guys here theyve got a trotline out a line going across the river with hooks at intervals and theyve just pulled a small gar out on that so the first fish actually now is gonna be tagged and then all the measurements taken and is the tag number the tag will provide the biologists with data about which areas of the trinity river the gar are using so they can formulate a plan to protect the species sounds like a visit to the dentist but actually quite appropriate because the scales of these things are very made of something called ganoin which is actually very similar to tooth enamel so hence the need for a drill just to penetrate that body armor engineered like medieval chain mail the gars suit of armor is built from thick diamond-shaped scales providing a formidable defense against attack theyre so hard that native americans used them for arrowheads and the fish i cant even feel it tensing its just lying here very very calmly wet towel over it over the eyes as well that has just come out of a very muddy river where it cant see much into the bright light unlike my last experience this young gar displays no aggressive behavior if youll read that number the top number okay this is were gonna just let that one go okay the gar is released unharmed ohh i guess he wanted to go he wanted to go the electronic tag will now send a signal to a series of receivers to monitor the fishs movements after several hours the scientists own search is finally successful nothing on the juglines but one caught in a net a two-foot gar there are no signs of any monster-sized fish it looks like the population of these fish is in a worse state than i thought maybe in the old days when these fish were literally everywhere crude techniques would work but now i think im going to have to develop an approach that is more precise and targeted im determined to get face-to-face with a giant gar and find out the truth behind its monstrous reputation im heading for the aquarium in athens texas where curator wayne heaton keeps some gator gar i need to know more about the business end of these fish just what exactly their teeth are capable of i think as far as a lot of people are concerned this is very close to a shark and its in freshwater its in a river near you you know sort of dont go in the water unfortunately with us especially if its something we dont know much about we always assume the worst and so you see a big 6- 7- 8-foot gar hit the surface with these monstrous teeth the first thing that comes to your mind is well im not getting in the water well you know and these teeth theyre not like our teeth theyre not kind of blunt you know we kind of have a few sharp ones for tearing or whatnot these things are made to whenever they grab something its theirs and so these teeth are very very sharp i wonder if perhaps theyre a bit simple-minded and theyre just sort of programmed even if it was dead theyre still programmed to sort of like keep it clamped for a little while before properly swallowing it when they grab it they kind of want to make sure its something that theyre gonna be able to swallow so you might see them hold it for a minute to make sure that thats what they want and once they decide to eat it youll start see them moving it in their mouth and then to the point where theyll actually swallow it but then once its there even though its a big mouth its you know that process seems to be quite a slow process right they will do it at their leisure theyre in no hurry because once they have that in their mouth they know its not going nowhere so if its something thats got quite a bit of fight theyll just keep that mouth closed until it wears itself out to where they can swallow it youre not gonna have something in the water to try to find the gar youre basically gonna let that gar come to you and hes gonna grab it and so when he grabs it you might not want to try to set the hook right when he grabs it because he might be still deciding whether he wants it or not but once he gets to where he wants to swallow it and then you set the hook you better be strapped in with the knowledge that i need a cautious patient approach i hire another fishing guide mark malfa to take me to a fresh section of the trinity river my plan to hold off setting the hook until im sure the gator gar has properly taken the bait that was definitely a fish moving off mm-hmm for sure not a damn thing this is actually very very frustrating fishing i mean something definitely had that in its mouth cause it moved it several yards but when i tighten down theres nothing there and really you know just talking to people who fish here theres not much that anybodys told me thats any use i mean very few people fish for these bobby fly caught his by accident and the fishing that is done on rod and line is pretty basic you know it does work its a fairly low-percentage success rate you chuck out a lump of dead fish like this and you wait and you let it take it for a long time and most times you tighten down theres nothing on the end but you know sometimes there is and it hasnt really got any more sophisticated than that but that was another half-hour with nothing to show at the end of it but focused on my target i fish on towards dusk what do you reckon tighten down yeah all right normally gar are caught before the water begins to cool down well before the sun sets thats gone off its gone off again most guides give up fishing by midafternoon set it set it set it set it set it there we go thats it please be on it you feel something yeah yeah yeah yeah its a fish oh yes yes whoo-hoo oh its gone under the boat under the boat under the boat under the boat just keep the tip away that soaked me im here feet above the water and i got a splashing yes finally it seems i am going to get face-to-face with my river monster whoo im hooked into my target a river monster with a fearsome reputation the alligator gar its pulling down its pulling down look at that rod tip lets get him up lets get him up after fishing for hours straight just as dusk turns to night i set my eyes on the giant fish do you want me to do it the most dangerous part of gar fishing is bringing the fish aboard the boat coming over oh there we go thats what we wanted thats exactly what we wanted that is exactly what we wanted thats a proper-sized fish as the gar comes aboard it thrashes its snout from side to side like a scythe i havent forgotten that 3-footer that got me this fish is almost feet long single hook single hook single hook single hook yeah weve done it weve done it fantastic mark that was really ooh unh unh unh whoo-hoo-hoo okay you got the gaff handle yes all right so this will go in here okay the teeth of this gar are another half-inch longer than those that scarred me earlier its pounds good good good good yes finally getting my hands on the fish and seeing it face-to-face i can begin to weigh up the evidence actually laying hands on this prehistoric beast this is fantastic i mean this is the creature that i came here to see i mean you hear people say like mark that these things they wont just devour a bait they will just theyre so fiddly though they will just sit and chew it and maybe spit it out you know ive had fish take yards of line even in minutes you tighten down and theres just nothing on the end gar dont bite pieces off their prey they only eat what they can swallow whole this puts humans off the menu for all this fierce reputation you know they do seem to be you know they certainly look the part though im not sure that they actually act up to the part ooh what a thing what an animal this gator gar seems too gentle-natured to cause deliberate harm interesting that heres the bait you know it hasnt taken it down the bait is oh there we go there we go there we go yeah girl dont worry youre going back in the water in a moment maybe well throw that afterwards as a little consolation but that was interesting when it just did that the whole upper jaw sort of expanded didnt it you know when it actually came up and gulped you can actually see the gaps where theres actually flesh in between and the heads allowed to expand right through these two little veins right through here and up through here you see that separation of the jaw that actually gives theres flesh in between these areas as well as up in through here see that this is solid solid right heres flesh that attaches the joints so it allows the head to flex and move the skin that joins these armored plates allows the gars jaw to expand but not so much that it could consume a person or even a human limb its very tempting just to keep it out and admire it you know but i think what is important although this animal is an air breather i think it is very much time to get it back in so i think one last look and back in the water up ohh lets see how its doing okay you got it okay its very hard to hold and you got the heavier end ive got the heavy end ive got the bony end this female gator gar measures shes longer than i am tall then once again the gar draws blood she has a 14-inch-long mouth full of some teeth thats not actually the teeth of the animal though is it that is the back of a scale or some scales slicing across your yeah as the fish my hand with the weight of the fish on my forearm there the fish just slid back sliding that way is fine sliding this way the points the rear points of these triangular scales stuck in the native americans used to use them as arrowheads and i can sort of see why now ive got a big old scrape down my arm there from the scales anyway should we get uh i believe ive seen enough to clear the gars name youve got that yeah its time to return the specimen to the wild and reflect on other possible suspects okay lift that okay bye-bye baby there it goes there it goes excellent wow has the clue been there all along in the very name the alligator gar shares with another predator if you put legs on that it would just be like an alligator it would get up and walk is the real culprit the animal it could so easily be mistaken for aah the american alligator after years of one-sided testimony its time for the jury to review the verdict on the guilt of the gator gar there must be a more logical culprit for the many incidents that have been blamed on the gar in the same rivers and lakes that they inhabit there are also many american alligators not only do they share the same habitats they have similar teeth their size and the profile of their snouts could easily be confused one for the other ive come to this alligator park in southern texas to get a look at some of the other characters that share the water with the alligator gar cause ive got a sneaking feeling that actually the alligator gar has taken the rap for somebody else and it could be these characters here what i really want to do is get a fairly close look at the equipment of the alligator and what would be really good would be to actually see them in action as well but i think that part of it is probably best left to gary gary saurage is a key witness for the gars defense he understands the crucial difference between the behavior of a fish and an alligator you can imagine an animal like this would have no problem taking a full-grown man theyre sneaky theyre tremendously patient and these animals right here theres no telling how many deaths theyre really responsible for every year this is the apex hunter in the united states of america right here lets say its a hot summer day you decide youre gonna dip your feet in the water a little bit theyre dangling down and wow they come on up and hit when the alligators hunting his prey hell shoot up out of the water and theyll grab whatever limb he can get and on the way down hell do a death roll and if you were to resist that its whatever limb he gets whether it be hand finger or toes its coming off the alligator gar doesnt have near the pressure the american alligator can bite down with pounds per square inch and im sure many many times folks may think that its an alligator gar on a bad bite but you can rest assured its not its normally the american alligator gar have neither the power nor the attitude for premeditated violent attacks on humans alligator gar dont chew so they only eat stuff big enough that they can swallow whole depending on the size of the gar it depends on what size the food item that theyll eat but a good 6- to 8-foot gar could very easily take out a 12- to 14-inch fish im left in little doubt that many of the attacks attributed to gator gar are far more likely to be the work of the american alligator ive heard all these myths about the alligator gar you know ripping peoples legs off chopping alligators in half generally terrorizing the neighborhood but whats interesting is since having come here and spoken to people who actually know about this fish and having spent some time myself on the river ive got this idea that its actually just got a bad pr agent i think its a bit of a pussycat it just so happens that here is a tank with some very big alligator gar in and this is actually my chance to test my theory for myself ive been at the sharp end of a 3-foot gator gars teeth whoops back in the water ive felt the muscle power held in the serpentine body of a monster its pounds but now ive got to walk the talk ive got to venture into the gars own underwater world none of the gar show any intent to harm me in my view its the alligator gar itself that has been the victim its amazing to get this close this fish really is a miracle of evolution a true survivor but if anyone is gonna see the real giants this fish needs to be allowed to grow without persecution maybe then well get to see those 14-footers again that was that that was that was an experience ohh i have to say the size the size and the aspect of those fish though when i first saw them was really quite intimidating but i think this is a very very misunderstood animal and i think it really is time that we just try to understand this fish a little bit better,bagarius yarrelli also known as the goonch catfish giant devil catfish or simply goonch is a very large species of catfish in the genus bagarius found in rivers in the indian subcontinent the species reaches up to m ft in length it may be synonymous with b bagarius etymology the species is known by many names throughout its range in the indian subcontinent it is known as the goonch in urdu hindi and punjabi baghar or baghair in bengali and bihari these names being the origin of the genus name bagarius gauns in rajasthani gorua and baghmas in assamese and bodh in chhattisgarhi its scientific name commemorates the english naturalist william yarrell taxonomy the species is frequently taxonomically confused with b bagarius b bagarius has perhaps in error been reported as reaching the same size as b yarrelli while others consider b bagarius to be a dwarf species that only reaches about cm in a study published in found b yarrelli to be a junior synonym of b bagarius likely necessitating a merge of b yarrelli into b bagarius distribution and habitat it is found in large rivers in south asia such as the indus and ganges basins it is more common in deeper pools near faster current but never in small streams two other populations were also formerly thought to exist in southeast asia one population in the mekong-chao phraya basin and the other from the xe bang fai of laos south to indonesia but a study found the former to represent a new species b vegrandis and the latter to represent the distinct species b lica previously synonymized with b yarrelli threats while still abundant the species is considered vulnerable on the iucn red list due to excessive unsustainable overharvesting of the species hydroelectric projects such as those on the indravati river may affect the habitat of the species and adversely impact it cultural significance the order of the fish was the highest honour of the mughal empire and named after this fish in chhattisgarh the species is worshipped by tribal communities such as the murias and gonds and is popularly referred to as the shark of the bastar there have been efforts to name it the official state fish of chhattisgarh in captivity bagarius yarrelli has seldom been kept successful in a home aquarium setting some monster fish enthusiasts have attempted to house this species in home aquaria to varying degrees of success unlike some other larger catfish species such as the sun catfish or pictus catfish goonch catfish will quickly outgrow even the largest systems and are far more suited for an outdoor tropical pond setting or the largest of public aquaria displays despite this juveniles are sometimes seen for sale at much smaller sizes around - in length to unexpecting buyers they are also a very aggressive species in the presence of most other fish exhibiting territorial aggression and possessing two rows of larger sharp pointed teeth making them unsuitable for virtually any

as a gator is blamed wherever we have alligator gar there are myths of monsters the state authorities said it should be electrocuted now im on a mission to get face-to-face with this river monster whoo you better be strapped in to find out if this animal really is guilty of the crimes its blamed for im jeremy wade a fisherman and a biologist with a passion for freshwater giants ive traveled the globe putting my life on the line to find truly monster-sized fish its become something of an obsession for me to get into really remote parts of the world and to find the animals that nobody else can but the creatures i hunt and find are not just*****************in size but in attitude too and now im on the trail of one that has a reputation for attacking humans ive heard some alarming stories of this creature over many years but ive never seen one in the flesh its the alligator gar a truly prehistoric monster there are five species of gar that inhabit the united states all gar are ancient fish theyve existed on earth for over million years their survival is in part because of their unique defense system scales made from a super-hard enamel called ganoin this armor plating has seen them survive predatory dinosaurs the alligator gar however is in a class apart named for the profile of its snout its the largest*****************all gar reaching some feet in length and weighing over pounds it has a further defining characteristic a double row of dagger-pointed teeth along the length of the upper jaw but these attributes have not been enough to defend it against a more modern threat man before their range extended beyond american borders but the impact of people means that now theyre not found above the bootheel of missouri and tennessee alligator gar stand accused of savage attacks on humans ive trawled the archives and all the attacks ive come across are concentrated in the deep south they certainly have the teeth for it but ive been unable to find any hard evidence that these fish are the culprits*****************im going to find an alligator gar guilty of these crimes im definitely looking for a very big fish the experts ive spoken to suggest texas is the place where the biggest specimens are still to be found im heading directly to the trinity river a 710-mile-long waterway here people have caught gator gar longer than i am tall bigger when you get close isnt it to help me im recruiting bubba bedre hes a specialist in finding alligator gar that weigh over pounds sometimes for food but normally for bow fishermen after trophies but im not planning to catch a fish for a trophy i want to find out if this creature has committed the crimes its accused*****************bubba is taking me straight to a section of the trinity that he believes holds the best hope of finding large gar what were doing now is were just drifting with the current and weve just come to a a bend in the river that doubles round and bubbas just said this is the hole this is a known haunt and i can imagine the current has actually dug out a bit of a you know a bit of a hole in the bottom here and apparently they are very aware more aware than a lot of fish of sort of knocking and noises in the boat so were literally just drifting with the current and just looking to*****************if we can see them come up and breach gar have a swim bladder that works like a lung an adaptation that helps them survive in oxygen-poor backwaters and creeks however this brings them up to the surface to breathe its a chink in their armor giving away their presence ooh yes so theyre just theyre just coming up and gulping air and going down yeah that fish there is mad he knows were here yeah exactly do you know when he splashes hard like that id guess assume to spook us off yeah ive come across exactly the same thing in the amazon theres a fish there that comes up and gulps air and if they do it*****************they dont know youre there if theyre like that you think oh thats a good fish but it is actually getting up and going down as quickly as it can so its the same behavior the rivers here have murky water with visibility limited gar use a band of highly sensitive vibration receptors along their body called the lateral line this enables them to locate prey and predators to avoid detection we decide to abandon the boat and fish from the shore im still experimenting with baits and im going to start off using a treble hook standard issue for big predatory fish although the waters muddy ive seen several come and break the surface so i know theyre*****************i know there are fish of 100-pounds-plus you know within a 25-yard radius of my bait you know thats quite a feeling its one of those moments in fishing where things can go from being very quiet like they are at the moment to you know suddenly can have an animal over pounds on the end of your line trying to pull you in the water but if there is a monster gator gar in these texan waters its not giving itself up easily if im to find one that fits the crimes its accused of aah it has to be at least as big as me a real river monster at lake livingston on the trinity river in*****************i seek out legendary fisherman bobby fly for some clues on how to find a giant specimen he caught one seven feet long that put him in the hall of fame and he believes there are still big gar around on the trinity you aint got to move your boat yards one way or the other to catch good garfish right there now i have seen one foot long down there garfish oh really mm-hmm i was tied up on top of a willow tree with a 14-foot flat-bottom and this bad boy come right up beside me and just surfaced right there and i seen the front of my boat and the back of my boat and i*****************fish all the way so i immediately pulled up the slack undone my rope and went on to the house i didnt hang around but this sighting was in and his record catch was landed in other anglers have pulled out large specimens but no fish over feet in length has been caught in the last decade the big question is are there still any gar left large enough to commit the attacks theyre accused of and if so how will i catch one thats interesting i mean thats a big fierce bobby fly caught his giant using a bait of a carp-like fish called a buffalo and how did you prepare the buffalo to okay you take the*****************and you want a nice one about oh pounds then you take a mallet and beat him up what like a hammer a mallet well a a little baseball bats what we used and you just whup on him real good and then you take your claws your fingernails and just get its tail and you just strip the fins off yeah and then you cut him up in little bitty squares like 14-inch squares and the blood the reason why you beat on the fish with a mallet is to get that blood all into the meat cause thats what theyre smelling out there they want that blood you just put it on that hook and throw it*****************there thats all very interesting all i got to do now is go out and try and get something similar-sized something close to that would make me happy i think well you will you will theres some big ones out there you go down there where i told you to go and youll be all right bobby flys optimism about the size of these fish is ringing in my ears but im still unsure whether this fish is as aggressive as its reputation suggests ive heard many stories of these fish attacking humans but one particular incident sticks in my mind a really gruesome report from the neighboring state louisiana try and catch me on a warm humid spring*****************a 9-year-old schoolgirl elizabeth grainger and her 13-year-old brother george are playing on the shoreline of the lake race you its not fair you always win elizabeth only a few feet away from her brother dangles her feet in the water you always win you always do aah suddenly something grabs hold of her leg aah dr robert b payne has worked as a physician for almost years but he has never seen wounds like this what have we here my goodness the press report georges claim that what attacked his sister was seven feet long and that he believed it to be a garfish in his medical report dr payne describes the wounds as being like coarse needles*****************in a board a wave of paranoia soon follows and the alligator gar is held accountable for many similar attacks although this was a well-documented event the identity of the attacker rested entirely on the testimony of a 13-year-old boy but was an alligator gar really the culprit or with its threatening prehistoric appearance was it just an obvious scapegoat i turn to mark spitzer an expert on the gar youve got a sort of an inch-thick or so is that what you is that the sort the official gar history as far as youve well this is my gar history ive been intensely researching gar for the last few years and you know all over the country wherever*****************have alligator gar there are myths of monsters these fish were the fishes of nightmares and so i mean one rumor that was created was that these fish eat twice their weight in a day and stuff like that you know and that they attack human beings so i mean were there lots of stories of that kind of nature there was an article that appeared in the new orleans newspaper called alligator gar more dangerous than so-called man-eater shark and heres this is a copy of the article it was written by an anonymous journalist who basically said if you should emerge from swimming or taking a bath and you find out that you have a limb missing*****************not blame the shark it is probably the alligator gar that did it its where does the fact end and the imagination and and sort of fantasy start the gar can certainly grow to a large size and it has a ferocious armory of teeth but does this prove an inclination to attack humans is it a natural i need to find hard evidence using the advice of fishing legend bobby fly im going for a bait of buffalo fish this i hope will let me get my hands on the alleged culprit but im learning on the job my best hope is to try and get into the mind of the gar ive only been here a very*****************time and because so few people fish for these fish its a big ugly stupid-looking fish so lets use fairly basic tackle and you know normally its a thick bit of wire some heavy line and a big treble hook i think theyre actually quite sensitive you know you can still you can still be sensitive even if youve got sort of a bogey mouth and i think thick wire they actually they can feel that when theyre chomping on it and i think a treble hook as well you know theres a nice soft succulent bit of fish and theres theres something in there now whats that and i think they can spit it out so im using*****************single hook and the thing about that it can just fold down nicely its not sticking out like you know three points on it both mark and i cast lines into the river but its the bait on the single hook that gets picked up somethings got it its moving its moving around to the left is it yeah it is i need to let the line run very freely to avoid the fish realizing the baits attached to anything somethings taken off its on the end its stopped its off again hes off again really yeah really its good its the line all right its gonna be very soon yeah oh i think its off aw oh no*****************no no no its coming toward us thats a small i think its a turtle or a small fish its coming in very easily or its a little gar is that a needle nose look at that greedy thing that greedy thing ah this gator gar has eyes bigger than its stomach but at three feet long its a chance for me to test whether these fish have an aggressive character right they grow inches their first year so its probably you know between a year and two that tongues interesting isnt it yeah theres those two rows of of teeth on the top these teeth are of an inch long of the length of those of a fully*****************gator gar unh thats it oh my god you got bit huh i was just in there trying to get the hook out score one for the fish yeah thats a very young alligator gar with a big appetite im just gonna lob him back in the water whoops back in the water my idea that the gar is just a misunderstood big ugly stupid fish has caught me out maybe it does deserve its reputation after all this fish has actually still got a lot of energy left i brought it in on very heavy gear so its actually got a lot of energy left normally theyd be pretty tired out i think im just gonna slide him*****************the side well ahead of our next fishing spot so here we go back you go even a fish this small has managed to draw blood good battle scars but you can see the sort of the cut on it this is a setback to my theory that the gator gar may have been unfairly blamed for these violent attacks the consequences if this fish were scaled up to a monstrous to feet are beginning to hit home when you think about a gar that size with teeth to match and a body like a torpedo it really is a terrifying prospect youve just got a living weapon of destruction that was just a gentle brush with its teeth*****************it wasnt particularly deep but they certainly drew blood whoops back in the water yet this alligator gar is only three feet long aah george grainger reported that what bit his sister was seven feet long and other reports state that these fish can reach double that length now i have seen one foot long down there its reputation for vicious attacks on humans is beginning to appear justified its no wonder that people took fright when you consider a beast of those dimensions with a couple of hundred razor-sharp teeth but i still dont have hard proof i believe the jury is still out in past times for many of those living in the deep south this was*****************fish guilty as charged one that should be eradicated from all rivers and lakes so they took it really seriously then the whole business of lets clear these things out of the water theyre you know theyre an abomination theyre not fit to sort of share the planet with us they obviously look guilty therefore they must be responsible for these occasional instance where someone gets their leg bitten or whatever but but but wheres the evidence basically they look scary and so that added to people just wanting to run them out of town and so they were run out of town i mean i heard of you know just sort of heaps of them up in the*****************know yeah bulldozered piles lots of people shooting them just a very despised hated fish in the texas game fish commission began a campaign of extermination they built an electric gar destroyer rigged with a 200-volt electric net to kill the fish over the next three decades millions of gar were destroyed in an effort to be rid of them forever perhaps the prejudice that the alligator gar has always suffered explains the extreme fishing methods used to catch them today unless they get the protection they need to reach full size giant alligator gar may well be wiped out now in texas for the first time the parks and wildlife authorities are trying to work out what the*****************has been to the gar population on the lower trinity were en route to set what are called juglines baited hooks attached to floats our plan is to catch as many gator gar as possible and then monitor them with electronic tags dr dave buckmeier leads this project dave whats the state of knowledge on the gar at the moment alligator gar along with other gars and buffalo and things have always been considered kind of rough fish which no one really cared much about is that the same as trash fish trash fish would be another common name for it and so there was actually even efforts to try and eradicate alligator gar and other gars from populations*****************they were believed to have eaten desirable fish if you will largemouth bass and things that we have catfish they have recently been listed as vulnerable by the american fisheries society and thats because in most states theyre definitely on the decline yeah so we have some real reasons for concerns about this species shall i chuck this out yeah go ahead throw that one out there and it unwinds itself does it yeah they just as the bait sinks itll unwind and then that lies on the bottom and just right and that lies on the bottom and when the gar come up to feed theyll kind of comb the bottom pick up the bait and usually run*****************it for minutes and after were confident theyve swallowed it well go pick up the bait its spinning nicely there it looks like its gone to rest not much research has yet been done but its thought few gator gar reach their maximum life-span of years as we move on to set more lines theres a call from the opposite bank of the river weve actually just put out some juglines and nets but some local guys here theyve got a trotline out a line going across the river with hooks at intervals and theyve just pulled a small gar out on that so the first fish actually now is gonna be tagged and then all the measurements taken*****************is the tag number the tag will provide the biologists with data about which areas of the trinity river the gar are using so they can formulate a plan to protect the species sounds like a visit to the dentist but actually quite appropriate because the scales of these things are very made of something called ganoin which is actually very similar to tooth enamel so hence the need for a drill just to penetrate that body armor engineered like medieval chain mail the gars suit of armor is built from thick diamond-shaped scales providing a formidable defense against attack theyre so hard that native americans used them for arrowheads and the fish i cant even feel it tensing*****************just lying here very very calmly wet towel over it over the eyes as well that has just come out of a very muddy river where it cant see much into the bright light unlike my last experience this young gar displays no aggressive behavior if youll read that number the top number okay this is were gonna just let that one go okay the gar is released unharmed ohh i guess he wanted to go he wanted to go the electronic tag will now send a signal to a series of receivers to monitor the fishs movements after several hours the scientists own search is finally successful nothing on the juglines but one caught in a net a*****************gar there are no signs of any monster-sized fish it looks like the population of these fish is in a worse state than i thought maybe in the old days when these fish were literally everywhere crude techniques would work but now i think im going to have to develop an approach that is more precise and targeted im determined to get face-to-face with a giant gar and find out the truth behind its monstrous reputation im heading for the aquarium in athens texas where curator wayne heaton keeps some gator gar i need to know more about the business end of these fish just what exactly their teeth are capable of i think as far as a lot*****************people are concerned this is very close to a shark and its in freshwater its in a river near you you know sort of dont go in the water unfortunately with us especially if its something we dont know much about we always assume the worst and so you see a big 6- 7- 8-foot gar hit the surface with these monstrous teeth the first thing that comes to your mind is well im not getting in the water well you know and these teeth theyre not like our teeth theyre not kind of blunt you know we kind of have a few sharp ones for tearing or whatnot these things are made to whenever they grab something its*****************and hes gonna grab it and so when he grabs it you might not want to try to set the hook right when he grabs it because he might be still deciding whether he wants it or not but once he gets to where he wants to swallow it and then you set the hook you better be strapped in with the knowledge that i need a cautious patient approach i hire another fishing guide mark malfa to take me to a fresh section of the trinity river my plan to hold off setting the hook until im sure the gator gar has properly taken the bait that was definitely a fish moving off mm-hmm for sure not a damn thing this is actually very very frustrating fishing i mean something definitely had that in its mouth cause it moved it several yards but when i tighten down theres nothing*****************and really you know just talking to people who fish here theres not much that anybodys told me thats any use i mean very few people fish for these bobby fly caught his by accident and the fishing that is done on rod and line is pretty basic you know it does work its a fairly low-percentage success rate you chuck out a lump of dead fish like this and you wait and you let it take it for a long time and most times you tighten down theres nothing on the end but you know sometimes there is and it hasnt really got any more sophisticated than that but that was another half-hour with nothing to show at*****************end of it but focused on my target i fish on towards dusk what do you reckon tighten down yeah all right normally gar are caught before the water begins to cool down well before the sun sets thats gone off its gone off again most guides give up fishing by midafternoon set it set it set it set it set it there we go thats it please be on it you feel something yeah yeah yeah yeah its a fish oh yes yes whoo-hoo oh its gone under the boat under the boat under the boat under the boat just keep the tip away that soaked me im here feet above the water and i got a splashing*****************finally it seems i am going to get face-to-face with my river monster whoo im hooked into my target a river monster with a fearsome reputation the alligator gar its pulling down its pulling down look at that rod tip lets get him up lets get him up after fishing for hours straight just as dusk turns to night i set my eyes on the giant fish do you want me to do it the most dangerous part of gar fishing is bringing the fish aboard the boat coming over oh there we go thats what we wanted thats exactly what we wanted that is exactly what we wanted thats a proper-sized fish as the gar comes aboard it*****************its snout from side to side like a scythe i havent forgotten that 3-footer that got me this fish is almost feet long single hook single hook single hook single hook yeah weve done it weve done it fantastic mark that was really ooh unh unh unh whoo-hoo-hoo okay you got the gaff handle yes all right so this will go in here okay the teeth of this gar are another half-inch longer than those that scarred me earlier its pounds good good good good yes finally getting my hands on the fish and seeing it face-to-face i can begin to weigh up the evidence actually laying hands on this prehistoric beast this is fantastic i mean this is*****************creature that i came here to see i mean you hear people say like mark that these things they wont just devour a bait they will just theyre so fiddly though they will just sit and chew it and maybe spit it out you know ive had fish take yards of line even in minutes you tighten down and theres just nothing on the end gar dont bite pieces off their prey they only eat what they can swallow whole this puts humans off the menu for all this fierce reputation you know they do seem to be you know they certainly look the part though im not sure that they actually act up to the part ooh what*****************is important although this animal is an air breather i think it is very much time to get it back in so i think one last look and back in the water up ohh lets see how its doing okay you got it okay its very hard to hold and you got the heavier end ive got the heavy end ive got the bony end this female gator gar measures shes longer than i am tall then once again the gar draws blood she has a 14-inch-long mouth full of some teeth thats not actually the teeth of the animal though is it that is the back of a scale or some scales slicing across your yeah as the fish my hand with the weight of the fish on my forearm there the fish just slid back sliding that way is fine sliding this way the points the rear points*****************these triangular scales stuck in the native americans used to use them as arrowheads and i can sort of see why now ive got a big old scrape down my arm there from the scales anyway should we get uh i believe ive seen enough to clear the gars name youve got that yeah its time to return the specimen to the wild and reflect on other possible suspects okay lift that okay bye-bye baby there it goes there it goes excellent wow has the clue been there all along in the very name the alligator gar shares with another predator if you put legs on that it would just be like an alligator it would get up and*****************is the real culprit the animal it could so easily be mistaken for aah the american alligator after years of one-sided testimony its time for the jury to review the verdict on the guilt of the gator gar there must be a more logical culprit for the many incidents that have been blamed on the gar in the same rivers and lakes that they inhabit there are also many american alligators not only do they share the same habitats they have similar teeth their size and the profile of their snouts could easily be confused one for the other ive come to this alligator park in southern texas to get a look at some of the other characters that*****************the water with the alligator gar cause ive got a sneaking feeling that actually the alligator gar has taken the rap for somebody else and it could be these characters here what i really want to do is get a fairly close look at the equipment of the alligator and what would be really good would be to actually see them in action as well but i think that part of it is probably best left to gary gary saurage is a key witness for the gars defense he understands the crucial difference between the behavior of a fish and an alligator you can imagine an animal like this would have no problem taking a full-grown man theyre sneaky*****************tremendously patient and these animals right here theres no telling how many deaths theyre really responsible for every year this is the apex hunter in the united states of america right here lets say its a hot summer day you decide youre gonna dip your feet in the water a little bit theyre dangling down and wow they come on up and hit when the alligators hunting his prey hell shoot up out of the water and theyll grab whatever limb he can get and on the way down hell do a death roll and if you were to resist that its whatever limb he gets whether it be hand finger or toes its coming off the alligator gar*****************have near the pressure the american alligator can bite down with pounds per square inch and im sure many many times folks may think that its an alligator gar on a bad bite but you can rest assured its not its normally the american alligator gar have neither the power nor the attitude for premeditated violent attacks on humans alligator gar dont chew so they only eat stuff big enough that they can swallow whole depending on the size of the gar it depends on what size the food item that theyll eat but a good 6- to 8-foot gar could very easily take out a 12- to 14-inch fish im left in little doubt that many of the*****************attributed to gator gar are far more likely to be the work of the american alligator ive heard all these myths about the alligator gar you know ripping peoples legs off chopping alligators in half generally terrorizing the neighborhood but whats interesting is since having come here and spoken to people who actually know about this fish and having spent some time myself on the river ive got this idea that its actually just got a bad pr agent i think its a bit of a pussycat it just so happens that here is a tank with some very big alligator gar in and this is actually my chance to test my theory for myself ive been at the*****************end of a 3-foot gator gars teeth whoops back in the water ive felt the muscle power held in the serpentine body of a monster its pounds but now ive got to walk the talk ive got to venture into the gars own underwater world none of the gar show any intent to harm me in my view its the alligator gar itself that has been the victim its amazing to get this close this fish really is a miracle of evolution a true survivor but if anyone is gonna see the real giants this fish needs to be allowed to grow without persecution maybe then well get to see those 14-footers again that was that that was that*****************an experience ohh i have to say the size the size and the aspect of those fish though when i first saw them was really quite intimidating but i think this is a very very misunderstood animal and i think it really is time that we just try to understand this fish a little bit better,bagarius yarrelli also known as the goonch catfish giant devil catfish or simply goonch is a very large species of catfish in the genus bagarius found in

alligator gar,alligator gar,atractosteus spatula,my name is jeremy wade im an explorer a biologist and a fisherman look at this there it is ive caught many extraordinary fish from rivers all around the world oh oh oh fish that can be described as real monsters normally i have to travel halfway round the world to find my quarry here we go the biggest some would say baddest freshwater fish on the planet its not often i hear of a river monster in my own backyard but this is exactly whats happened a report in a german newspaper says swimmers are being attacked in a lake outside berlin this isnt a far-off exotic place a river monster within miles of a 21st-century european capital can it really be true its an opportunity not to be missed im already packing my equipment i have my suspicions as to the identity of the culprit and if im right its a fish with a monstrous reputation chronicled since medieval times there it is there it is there it is the wels is europes largest freshwater fish capable of reaching over pounds ive been doing some research into this predatory member of the catfish family and im finding that ever since records began europe seems to have had its very own well-documented freshwater man-eater it appears the wels catfish is actually no stranger to making front-page news there are stories about this species going back literally for centuries portraying it as a man-eating monster ive been doing a bit of research quite frankly i had no idea it had such a reputation back in the 1500s a human head and a hand with a gold ring was found inside the stomach the corpse of a 7-year-old child body of a woman two girls devoured it just goes on and on but all this is just so tantalizing there are no hard facts and figures unless you know you count something like that if that was the equivalent of your front-page story in the 16th century would you go in the water it would be too easy to dismiss these tales as the work of superstitious unscientific medieval minds attacks and human body parts turning up in wels stomachs have been reported across eastern europe from russia to poland through the ages right up to the present day i recently came across this report in a german newspaper of swimmers in a lake being attacked by what is thought to be a large wels catfish im on my way to germany to investigate these attacks and maybe solve the mystery of a serial killer with its roots in europes medieval past germany is at the forefront of urban expansion although steeped in history it is now coated in glass and steel hardly the place for a man-eating monster schlachtensee is a lake just minutes from berlins city center and its just become germanys very own loch ness this is where the attacks are happening over a mile long and up to feet across the lake was formed in the last ice age these cold waters have always been a refuge for wels catfish and falling to over feet in places its plenty deep enough to hide an absolute monster the attacks were localized concentrated in two small areas strangely areas according to the local fishermen not traditionally the places to hunt for wels so just what happened im going to ask one of the victims jonas fei what exactly did you do when you came down that day maybe two or three months ago i was swimming or seconds out on the lake suddenly something big bit me i dont know what it was but it was a very big shock for me pain and shock it hurts very much of course almost exactly here yes right here in a freshwater lake so far from the sea the last thing you would expect is to get attacked by a fish its just not supposed to happen being bitten by a wels is to experience the power of two hard plates packed with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth huge jaw muscles create a crushing force a bite is like being grabbed by a vise covered in coarse sandpaper before this happened you used to quite enjoy coming here of course every day i would swim in here but after that yeah i dont swim again normally about or people are swimming here so definitely people have been put off you think yes yes of course yeah but jonas wasnt the only victim in almost the identical place katerina and her friend clara had an encounter that has spooked them out of the water for good just on a normal summer day and we wanted to swim a little bit and meet friends so we went to the lake we were swimming in the water just treading water and talking to each other and there was something swimming around our legs but we couldnt really define it i think it was like a snake in the water yeah then suddenly there was something on my leg then there was a wound on my leg there was blood there were two parts that part here and the other one on the other side i went to the hospital with my mother they reacted really shocked the doctors because theyve never seen anything like that before and there were other attacks the same pattern each time swimmers bitten on their legs sent terrified out of the water bleeding will these 21st-century attacks prove that this european river monster is no medieval myth what i want to find out is what provoked these attacks and are wels catfish really capable of what they stand accused of lets have this to find out whats going on below im working with my cameraman simon and a mini submarine we have also enlisted the help of dr christian wolter from the berlin fisheries to give me an expert opinion were here to examine the scene of the crime and see whether knowledge of the biology of the wels could explain what exactly happened to trigger such aggression thats about meters out isnt that that is about where the boy said he was attacked what we could do is take it down there just over a meter yeah youre straight in weed at a meter depth yeah thats okay id have thought youd be out of your depth you could stand up in that water couldnt you almost yeah so its weedy and shallow but for dr wolter this is just the information he needs to understand what is going on the wels were just doing what every parent does protecting their offspring the swimmers had trespassed into their nursery so is there anything special or unusual about where they took bites do you think its a common spawning place thats why it might be the reason why it occurred so close to the bank the place that weve heard about the attacks happening that would be a potential spawning place catfish is a plant spawner they build nests in the plants where they lay their egg and then they guard in there then its the only explanation that it was during the breeding time that they had the nests there were guarding the nest and attacked something which comes too close for this particular catfish it was a huge stress to guard the nest and have all those swimmers around so it was actually a provoked attack it was protecting the nest freshwater crayfish and other fish will eat eggs from an unguarded nest to prevent this the male catfish sits over its yellow eggs protecting them from all comers large or small there are two essential qualities that make a man-eater wels catfish certainly have the attitude but do they have the capacity do they literally have the stomach for the job as a younger angler i caught smaller wels but how big do they need to get to pose a serious threat to a human theres no point fishing over the attack sites breeding is over ive hooked up with local fisherman hoss statugy he knows where the wels are likely to be now me too but first weve got to get over the language barrier yeah um um um oh hey right ah oh i understand hes a butcher okay so now just fishing fishing huh right okay one glove no good not enough always with two one glove the fish can twist and twist you around so we have two gloves finally with the best spots pinpointed we want to start fishing at dusk so this is the place to fish wels are night stalkers their bodies are bulging with sensory receptors the lateral line that all fish have allows them to sense water vibrations but catfish also have extra receptors in their skin those tentacles are more than just feelers they can taste the water for slight chemical changes any clue that leads them to a meal which can be anything from fish to crustaceans even water birds when youre up against these super senses fishing gear for wels needs to be tough but you also need a bit of delicacy ive got very strong 80-kilo breaking strain braided line there so you can literally just hang on you dont have to let them take any line at all you just hang on and try and stop them getting anywhere near that wood float the slides but only up as whoops only up as far as the knot going down to a fairly big single hook and something on that hook that smells tasty so a dead fish as bait should hopefully draw a large catfish in the schlachtensee catfish prove elusive but my trip has not been wasted i have confirmed that these fish have an aggressive attitude it seems that these attacks in berlin werent predatory in their intent but defensive territorial behavior at breeding time but thats actually academic as far as the victims were concerned they came away with bleeding wounds on their legs which underlines the chilling truth a large wels catfish has both the size and the fearlessness to be a potential man-eater if theres one place where im gonna find out just how big the wels catfish grows and how potentially dangerous it is its here the rio ebro in northern spain the fish was introduced its been here a little more than years but in that time you know theyre catching fish bigger than i am i mean theyre growing massive so although part of me is a little bit dubious about coming here because it is an artificial situation im also quite excited because i think theres a very good chance that in the next few days im gonna see a seriously big fish on the end of my line northern spain the river ebro in a german scientist came here and released some wels into this river ever since not only have they grown in numbers but also in size the wels has become spains very own frankenstein monster there are three reasons why the wels catfish are growing so big in this river its a mixture of man-made and natural for a start youve got three of these huge dams and it just means theres so much more water more space for the fish to live in on top of that this water is hot the fish being a cold-blooded animal can just feed and grow for more months of the year than they do in eastern europe and in berlin this place was stuffed with fish anyway particularly carp the anglers are coming in theyre throwing in huge amounts of bait and just sending the whole system into hyperdrive this river has a policy of catch and release so every year the biggest fish are even bigger than the year before monsters of over pounds already prowl these waters wels can live to years such fish are a massive lure to fishermen from all over the world to test just how voracious these catfish are i head into one of the ebros swollen tributaries my guide tells me the fish are lurking right in at the margins theyre waiting to ambush fish in the current and also to grab anything that drops in from the banks very energetic active fishing thats quite precise as well on the move not sitting around waiting and its the kind of fishing where youre left in no doubt if youve got a bite youre gonna see it feel it hear it as something just launches itself at this and sort of wrenches on the rod ah yes yes yes yes were going downstream watch the oar watch the oar all right aah gone gone gone gone gone hey im not doing very well everythings happening too quickly this is the last place id expect to find a fat wallowing catfish but it shows how you can misjudge these guys im learning that theres more to wels behavior than i thought aah yes yes yes yes yes open the reel open the reel off off off off off its off again aah its off literally took within about a second of the lure hitting the water about inches from the bank this water is cracking along at such a rate this is like a fast running pace thats the place let it sink a little bit and then twitch a little bit you see that thats coming direct the fish is in the water we let it sink and pow absolutely two strikes on that fish damn the wels have made themselves totally at home here not just in the main channels but throughout the whole river system as apex predators they have a confidence that im about to witness firsthand these fish are scared of nothing look at this thats a big fish i could almost reach down and grab its mouth do you have a calamari theres a catfish here its big its pounds plus it is two feet beneath me the bank goes down here i am looking into its mouth i could almost reach down and touch it well the fish has backed off i think he could see me im gonna throw this really hard no reaction no reaction the fish is just melting away backwards this is a really rare sight that fish is foot long its about pounds at least and it was in the margins and i could see the whole fish there it is thats a sight that is a rare sight that is a big fish if i got down on my knees then i could have patted him on the head mouth like that right underneath me and looking down on its back this wonderful light camo pattern this disruptive sort of black and white threw a stone to see if there would be a reaction no he just reversed back and then under the boat and away i really like seeing fish like that its fantastic really good any other fish would have been spooked off by that stone it would have disappeared in a flash and that guy is not even a really big one im on the banks of the river ebro in spain hunting down giant wels catfish theyre estimated to put on up to pounds a year if thats true it wont be long before an ebro wels reaches the man-eating proportions of medieval folklore if im after a man-eater i need to catch at the very least a man-sized fish one that falls on the fat side of pounds its time to rig up rather than casting we drop our baits over yards out just short of the sunken trees along the flooded river channel take up the slack then with the high-tech alarms set i can enjoy the spanish sun and now we wait this is not my preferred fishing technique i like to feel the line be in contact with the bait but wels are not delicate feeders and besides its hot here yes here here and its about to get hotter thats taking line thats taking line thats taking line this is my first supersized spanish wels and immediately it feels seriously big this is physical physical stuff a serious burst from that fish when it first took its already taking line on us stick it out my forearm is almost cramping up its a good size have you got the fish i did get it feels like yeah he was moving up the side these spanish wels are hunting in broad daylight they really are breaking their programming and these fish even seem used to being handled my first fish is pounds and measures foot inches if these fish are putting on pounds a year then in years this already massive creature could weigh as much as pounds more than double its present size and if they do live until years ill let you do the maths the only thing that will restrict them is food but there is one food supply here that is in huge quantities other catfish the wels is not just a man-eater its a cannibal just getting sort of a cool scientific look at this animal i mean the first thing obviously the thing to do start at the business end the head i mean the main thing is just this very very wide mouth about inches across on this animal and youve got needlelike teeth they are sharp as well you put your hand in there and theyll draw blood but in terms of getting a grip just perfect if they clamp down tight with those sort of jaw muscles youre not gonna get out of that theyre just purpose-built for lurking on the bottom and grabbing stuff that comes above them and theyre gonna know that stuff is there the prey because their eyes are on top of their head but more to the point theyve got these and these are just you know this is like sort of extra-sensory perception you can tell whats going on in the water these will pick up vibrations and also chemicals in very very sensitive very small quantities in both cases on the side youve got very pronounced on this animal the lateral line and this is their super organ the super-touch organ it just picks up vibrations in the water you know often again at a very low level and also you can see here these sort of marks on the skin now i think these are probably wounds from another fish possibly when this fish was spawning and you know they got a little bit too rough a little bit sort of over-enthusiastic stomach here theres the vent there so actually if it swallows something this fish could potentially swallow something that long it goes to the back of the throat which is here it opens up this sort of sphincter muscle there and it could swallow something about two foot long so no problem accommodating those medieval accounts of babies and small children in the belly of the beast it looks like wels catfish can swallow prey roughly a third of their own body length so if these fish in the ebro keep on growing its possible that they could reach a size where they will have man-eating potential fact is following close on the heels of what was once thought to be fiction looking at this fish it is the perfect predator i mean they do eat anything literally anything but they are perfectly equipped to predate and also to come from underneath you know that is just a mouth on the end of a solid sinuous piece of muscle anyway i cant hold him much longer wels like all catfish could live quite a long time out of water if kept cool and wet this guy seems quite reluctant to leave shall i leave him there a nice rub on his belly in a split second the fish turns im just quick enough to escape that was the first catfish attack on a human on-camera i was just wondering is he gonna move and he did sort of double round and i have heard stories of them actually having a bite of somebody whos caught them so i thought thats not gonna happen to me theres no mark there theres no mark there but it has happened i fish on into darkness and i get another surprise its just pulled me on my ass fish on me pulled towards the water i thought i was gonna go in there theres nothing thats a sizeable fish sizeable fish with so many fishermen around the only inconvenience these fish suffer for their midnight feasts is a little bit of manhandling imagine being in a river at night with one of these things swimming around your legs i dont know how big it is yet i can see its big right yep i think 147 how wide its about nine inches isnt it mm-hmm this fish is almost as heavy as i am i mean it is this is quite a monstrous beast and the power as well i felt the power the thing nearly pulled me in the river so you know definitely a fierce predatory animal and some of these stories about them maybe attacking swimmers i dont know i can believe them now having actually seen the size of one of these things actually up close im still short of my target 150-pound beast these creatures really are ugly out of the water i want to see them in their natural element but that means getting into the water cameraman simon and i are going to try an experiment i want to see and film a wels catfish underwater i want to see exactly how europes biggest freshwater predator operates in its element what i really want to see is the moment when the wels gets to strike its prey it isnt gonna be easy this is something that very very few people get to see but i do have a few ideas about what i can use to tempt the fish in this is the camera and this is whats gonna be behind the boat and about three feet behind this is gonna be the lure so its gonna be looking back thing is this is actually quite a lump of a camera even though its a small camera so i think here we go floatation two if we need them two tanks and to stop it wibble-wobbling around a little bit because were angling there we go one of those and that will just keep it flying straight and level and well lob that off the back of the boat and well see the lure and hopefully well see something come up and grab the bait ill need to hang on otherwise you know if something big takes this you know the whole monitor could go overboard this is actually working really well ive got the lure in picture its bang in the middle of the screen im actually watching you know normally its just there and youve no idea whats happening i can actually see my lure out behind the boat a fish i think it was a carp yeah oh were bumping over the bottom oh dear whats going on there right need to in a bit in a bit in a bit its bumping its bumping ive lost the lure havent i ive lost the lure i think the camera might have been bashed around a bit though aah not robust enough unfortunately to withstand being bashed along the bottom but other than that actually doing very well before that there was this gray shadow that appeared from nowhere which sort of came and went and it could have been a catfish investigating it and shying off at the last minute or it could have just been a rock going past i dont know what im about to see is another unexpected aspect of these fishes behavior what were doing is were doing something called clonking and its sending a sound wave down into the water and we can see on the sonar - oh yeah - yeah yeah this is a fish oh yes yes yes catfish yeah yeah yeah on your lures oh there it is there it is ive got it theres a catfish theres a catfish see him yeah its right under the lure yeah fantastic i see him on the sonar yeah yeah there he is there he is tentacles thats big yeah yeah yeah yeah right whats happened now and its coming up now right in the middle of the screen fantastic look at that hes attacking the camera what this has just demonstrated is that when youve got splashing when youve got commotion on the surface the catfish which they live on the bottom they will come up to investigate ah yes yes yes yes yes bottom of the screen there it is there it is there it is look at that there it is oh hes come off come off this is amazing getting a fish on-camera taking a bait attracted in by sound and vibration like sharks to a plane crash these fish fear nothing it even attacks the camera its been really good though just to actually see what ive seen on the screen very very rare to see this fish behavior so i feel sort of quite privileged to have seen that although we didnt get a fish into the boat i actually feel it was a successful day because i feel that ive actually learnt a lot about the behavior particularly how they react to vibration to commotion on the surface heres this fish that lives on the bottom but if it hears something it comes up and the tentacles are waving and it investigates without the camera under the water you just assume that nothing is happening as soon as you put the camera there dangling under the boat youre making the noise with the clonk theyre coming up into the middle of the water and they wont know whats going on everything ive seen so far the reaction of the wels catfish to a bait in the water confirms its aggression as a top predator and also its fearlessness combine that with supersizing and youve got a creature that you really wouldnt want to get too close to in the water what i want to know now is just how big a wels would need to be to tackle me in the water ive said they look like giant slugs but in their element theyre like super-sensitive sharks time for another experiment like most people if i jump in the water i dont sink i float even after a heavy lunch and its not too difficult im flapping my arms a little bit and my legs but the question is how big would a fish need to be to pull me under right ive got one dive weight on at the moment pounds and i can support it actually thats harder its harder pounds now doubling the rate of paddling but i can still just about keep myself on the surface right i can support pounds with a bit of flapping and flailing of my legs weve just weighed this rock this is gonna make it up to pounds ill just see how i do against that combined weight in the water that was actually very interesting pounds of weight attached to me i could just about keep my head above-water it was a struggle i reckon another pounds and id have just gone no matter how much my arms and legs would have been flailing around and thats interesting cause if you ask most people how big a fish would have to be to pull a body underwater theyd say probably something about the same size as that person now i weigh about pounds and on land i can take care of myself but in the water you know a fish would just have to exert a pull of pounds about of my body weight and i wouldnt stand a chance id just be gone and if i took a lungful of water underneath there then nobody would ever see me again okay that just goes to show that it doesnt need to be a huge fish to pull me under lets have a closer look at pulling power that pounder pulled me off my feet and almost into the water how much force can i generate i couldnt even pull in our director and shes half my weight shes a match for me even one-handed so i could be pulled under the water by a fish just half my size to pounds and the thing about the ebro is that the river is just full of fish that size and much bigger which possibly explains why you dont see very many people swimming with only a few days left in northern spain im trying to break the 150-pound marker that i have set myself my respect for these fish over the past few days has really grown oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh aah aah if this one pulls me over im in real trouble im nearly tipping forward over that edge and im just gonna move a bit my groin is starting to ache there it is the rods jammed in its just physical stuff physical work its coming up strong fish but i think yeah its tiring tiring tiring there it is theres the fish hey good grief my crotch is killing me and there it is but does it weigh more than pounds get a measure of the beast that is foot 2 4 foot inches let me open the mouth you can actually hear the echo coming out of the mouth there hello hello i can see its gullet opening and closing if i was so inclined i could put my fist down there quite easily that is an eating machine the whole thing is nearly foot of just solid rippling muscle if that grabbed hold of your leg thats an unpleasant-enough thought but if that decided not to let go and you were swimming youd be history im about pounds on a good day or a bad day depending how you look at it this fish could be more than that yeah kilos thats about pounds not quite as big and fat and ugly as i am what i find really hard to credit when i was doing those experiments where i was trying to see how much force i could exert in the water and there was somebody on the bank with a spring balance just hooked round their finger reading off okay or pounds this thing in the water is almost pulling me off the bank i was having to dig in and really act like i was in a tug-of-war how something with nothing solid to actually grab hold of can exert that force in the water you know i find quite mind-boggling it is very very impressive indeed and now its time to let this guy go lets see how he reacts fish has recovered a bit maybe a bit more than i have im gonna put it back in the water if it does have a go at me im gonna actually stand my ground and a bit like an elephant see if it its a false charge or will it actually go and grab my leg this is what im trying to remember that this fish is bigger than i am its got a few inches on me ive got a few pounds on this fish but im in the water my extra weight actually counts for nothing its the fishs environment sinking down towards my foot i think i think my reflexes overruled what i wanted to do which was stand my ground but i can visualize it too much what might be going on down there what might be going through its mind so dont tangle with these guys in their environment is the message wels catfish are predators with a lot of attitude two of the fish that i caught turned on me while i was releasing them but as far as eating people a wels will swallow anything that fits inside its monstrous gut ah yes yes yes and if that includes you well its no respecter of species it seems that if they ever went away these medieval monsters are now back alive and well and still growing in the river ebro in northern spain this is quite a monstrous beast if i came back here in or years i think its possible there could be something in here that is bigger than anything thats ever existed before and in the not-too-distant future a baby-snatching man-eating wels could once again make the front-page news,the alligator gar atractosteus spatula is a euryhaline ray-finned fish in the clade ginglymodi of the infraclass holostei being most closely related to the bowfins it is the largest species in the gar family lepisosteidae and is among the largest freshwater fishes in north america the fossil record traces its groups existence back to the early cretaceous over million years ago gars are often referred to as primitive fishes or living fossils because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks and the ability to breathe in both air and water their common name was derived from their resemblance to the american alligator particularly their broad snouts and long sharp teeth it is suggested that an alligator gar can grow up to ft m in length the body of an alligator gar is torpedo-shaped usually brown or olive colored fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface in very rare occurrences they can also be black seen in gars that have a high level of melanin their scales are not like the scales of other fishes rather they are ganoid scales which are bone-like rhomboidal-shaped scales often with serrated edges and covered by an enamel-like substance ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and are excellent protection against predation unlike other gar species the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a dual row of large sharp teeth that are used to impale and hold prey alligator gar are stalking ambush predators primarily piscivores but they also ambush and eat waterfowl and small mammals they find floating on the waters surface populations of alligator gar have been extirpated from much of their historic range as a result of habitat destruction indiscriminate culling and unrestricted harvests populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the united states extending into mexico they are considered euryhaline because they can adapt to varying salinities ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes estuaries and bays along the gulf of mexico for nearly a half century alligator gar were considered trash fish or a nuisance species detrimental to sport fisheries and were targeted for elimination by state and federal authorities in the united states the 1980s brought a better understanding of the ecological balance necessary to sustain an ecosystem and an awareness that the alligator gar is an important element of the ecosystems they inhabit was eventually understood over time alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies they are also protected under the lacey act which makes transporting certain species of fish in interstate commerce illegal when in violation of state law or regulation several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public alligator gar are being cultured in ponds pools raceways and tanks by federal hatcheries for mitigation stocking by universities for research purposes and in mexico for consumption anatomy alligator gar are the largest species in the gar family and among the largest freshwater fishes found in north america mature alligator gar commonly measure ft m in length and weigh over lb kg however anecdotal reports suggest they can grow up to ft m in length and weigh as much as lb kg the largest alligator gar officially recorded was inadvertently caught in the net of fisherman kenny williams of vicksburg mississippi while he was fishing the oxbow lakes of the mississippi river on february 2011 williams was pulling up his net on lake chotard expecting to find buffalo fish but instead discovered a large alligator gar tangled in his net the gar was ft in m long weighed lb kg and its girth was in cm according to wildlife officials the fish was estimated to be between and years old one report estimated the gars age to be at least williams donated it to the mississippi museum of natural science in jackson where it will remain on display all gars have torpedo-shaped bodies but some distinguishing characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size heavy bodies broad heads short broad snouts large sharp teeth and a double row of teeth on their upper jaws they are usually brown or olive colored fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface the dorsal and anal fins are positioned toward the back of their bodies and their caudal fins are abbreviate heterocercal or nonsymmetrical physiology alligator gar have gills but unlike other species of fish with few exceptions they also have a highly vascularized swim bladder lung that supplements gill respiration the bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air this capability allows alligator gar to inhabit stagnant andor insufficiently aerated bodies of water that are poorly oxygenated or hypoxic in which most other fishes would die of suffocation due to a lack of dissolved oxygen within the water the swim bladder is connected to their fore gut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the waters surface an action seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern united states during the hot summer the scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales gar bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are rhomboidal-shaped often with serrated edges and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel making them nearly impenetrable taxonomy and evolution lacepede first described the alligator gar in the original name was lepisosteus spatula but was later changed by eo wiley in to atractosteus spatula to recognize two distinct taxa of gars synonyms of atractosteus spatula include lesisosteus sic ferox rafinesque and lepisosteus spatula lacepede fossils from the order lepisosteiformes have been collected in europe from the cretaceous to oligocene periods in africa and india from the cretaceous and in north america from the cretaceous to recent times the lepisosteidae are the only extant family of gars with seven species all located in north and central america the fossil record traces the existence of gars such as the alligator gar back over million years ago to the early cretaceous period despite being a highly evolved species alligator gar are often referred to as primitive fishes or living fossils because they have retained a few morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors with seemingly few to no apparent changes such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks an abbreviate heterocercal tail and a swim bladder lung for breathing in both air and water feeding behavior alligator gar are relatively passive seemingly sluggish solitary fish but voracious ambush predators they are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores but gar will also ambush and eat water fowl other birds turtles and small mammals that may be floating on the surface their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach the gar will then lunge forward and with a sweeping motion grab their prey impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth diet studies have shown alligator gar to be opportunistic piscivores and even scavengers depending on the availability of their preferred food source they occasionally ingest sport fish but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on forage fishes such as gizzard shad as well as invertebrates and water fowl however brackish water populations of alligator gar are known to feed heavily on blue crabs in addition to fish such as the hardhead catfish ariopsis felis diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat-engine parts in their stomachs spawning as with most ancestral species alligator gar are long-lived and sexually late maturing most females do not reach sexual maturity until after their first decade of life while males reach sexual maturity in half that time the conditions must be precise for a successful spawning to occur preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended photoperiod and rising water temperatures but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event when rivers rise and spread over the floodplain they create oxbow lakes and sloughs and inundate terrestrial vegetation which in turn provides protection and a nutrient-rich habitat for larval fish and fry once the water temperature has reached to f to c and all the other criteria are met gar move into the grassy weed-laden shallows to spawn actual spawning occurs when males gather around gravid females and begin writhing twisting bumping into and slithering over the tops of females an activity which triggers the release of eggs males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column the sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation and development begins only a few days are needed for the eggs to hatch into larval fish and another days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry egg production is variable and believed to be dependent on the size of the female a common formula used for predicting the number of eggs a female can produce is eggsgram of body weight which gives an average of about eggs per spawn the eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested distribution natural range alligator gar inhabit a wide variety of aquatic habitats but most are found in the southern united states in reservoirs and lakes in the backwaters of lowland rivers and in the brackish waters of estuaries bayous and bays gars occur southward along the gulf coast of texas into tamaulipas and northern veracruz mexico however records from nicaragua and costa rica are considered suspect and refuted they have occasionally been seen in the gulf of mexico in texas and louisiana large gars are commonly seen breaking the surface in reservoirs bayous and brackish marshes they are found throughout the lower mississippi river valley and gulf coast states of the southern united states and mexico as far south as veracruz and encompassing the following states in the us texas oklahoma louisiana kentucky mississippi alabama tennessee arkansas missouri illinois and florida reports suggest alligator gar were once numerous throughout much of their northern range but valid sightings today are rare and may occur once every few years records of historical distribution indicate alligator gar once inhabited regions as far north as central kansas nebraska ohio iowa and west-central illinois where they are now listed as extirpated the most northerly verified catch was in meredosia illinois in in there were efforts to reintroduce alligator gar between tennessee and illinois as part of an effort to control invasive asian carp outside natural range alligator gar is an invasive species in mainland china where it can be purchased as an exotic pet fish due to its large size and armored scales it has few natural predators even within its natural range and its poisonous eggs may pose a passive threat to other fish the fish has been sighted in eight provinces and authorities have worked to remove it in november a broadhead gar genus atractosteus measuring to ft to m was caught in the caspian sea north of esenguly turkmenistan by two officials of turkmenistan fishery protection on september 2009 a ft in m alligator gar was found in tak wah park in tsuen wan hong kong over the next two days at least other alligator gar the largest measuring ft m were found in ponds within public parks in hong kong nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists and had lived there for several years however after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles the use of terms like horrible man-eating fish had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers officials with leisure and cultural services in tak wah park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large carnivorous fish might harm children not unusually the large sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar can precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans though none of the reports have been confirmed on january 2011 an alligator gar measuring ft in m was caught in a canal in pasir ris singapore by two recreational fishermen the fish was taken to a nearby pond where the owner confirmed it was an alligator gar rather than an arapaima as the men had initially thought anecdotal reports have been made of alligator gar captured in various parts of india but are believed to be the result of incidental releases by aquarium hobbyists and the like in august an alligator gar was found entangled in cloth inside a well in dadar where it had been living for quite some time it was rescued by animal activists and returned to the well unharmed in june a -ft alligator gar was caught from subhash sarovar lake in kolkata other incidents over the years have been random ranging from captures in coastal waters during environmental assessments to captures in private ponds on june 2020 an alligator gar measuring cm ft 8in was reported dead on the shore of gonyeli baraji reservoir north cyprus specialists from cyprus wildlife research institute collected the fish and explained its species to be alligator gar atractosteus spatula it is suspected that the fish had been released recently and could not cope with the environment and died however it could be that the fish was resident there for years a necropsy will be applied to find out more similarly on may 2023 an alligator gar measuring less than feet was caught during a deweeding process in dal lake of kashmir near the sher-i-kashmir international conference centre skicc sparking concerns about potential effects on the ecosystem in thailand an alligator gar have long been considered an imported aquarium fish in reports of their discovery in various natural water sources believed that they were released by aquaristen in they were reported in the mekong river in chiang rai province a natural border between thailand laos and myanmar alongside siberian sturgeon human uses early history native americans in the south and caribbean peoples used the alligator gars ganoid scales for arrow heads breastplates and as shielding to cover plows early settlers tanned the skins to make a strong durable leather to cover their wooden plows make purses and craft various other items gar oil was also used by the people of arkansas as a repellent for buffalo gnats for nearly half a century alligator gar were considered trash fish or nuisance species by state and federal authorities who targeted them for elimination to protect gamefish populations and to prevent alleged attacks on humans a claim that remains unsubstantiated with the exception of occasional injuries sustained from captured alligator gar thrashing around on the decks of boats fishermen participated in the slaughter of thousands of alligator gar believing they were providing a great service in pbs affiliate kuht channel became the presenting station for a public-outreach program that documented the life history cycle of alligator gar titled the alligator gar predator or prey it was the first documentary ever produced and televised nationally about alligator gar at a time when it was still being referred to as a trash fish the half-hour program ran for three years as part of an educational series titled exotic and unusual fishes produced by earthwave society it first aired in primetime during the july sweeps and drew a rating4 share making it the number-one rated program of the evening for several pbs affiliates a decade passed before any significant action was taken to protect and preserve the remaining populations of alligator gar in the united states among the first to enact restoration and management practices was the missouri department of conservation in partnership with tennessee arkansas kentucky illinois alabama mississippi texas oklahoma and louisiana sport fish the long-time public perception of alligator gar as trash fish or a nuisance species has changed with increasing national and international attention on the species as a sport fish which some have attributed to features on popular television shows oklahoma texas arkansas mississippi and louisiana allow regulated sport fishing of alligator gar texas has one of the best remaining fisheries for alligator gar and in concert with its efforts to maintain a viable fishery imposed a one-per-day bag limit on them in the texas state record and world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel is lb kg taken by bill valverde on january 1951 on the rio grande in texas alligator gar are also quite popular among bowfishers because of their large size trophy potential and fighting ability the texas state bowfishing record was set in by marty mcclellan with a lb kg alligator gar from the trinity river the all-tackle record was a lb kg alligator gar caught on a trotline in by tc pierce jr in fishing guide kirk kirkland anecdotally reported catching an alligator gar measuring ft in m on rod and line from the trinity river commercialization and aquaculture declining populations of alligator gar throughout their historic range have resulted in the need to monitor wild populations and regulate commercial harvests alligator gar have a high yield of white-meat fillets and a small percentage of waste relative to body weight fried gar balls grilled filets and fillets boiled in water with crab boil are popular dishes in the southern united states there is also a small cottage industry that designs and sells jewelry made from the ganoid scales of alligator gar some tan the hides to produce leather for making lamp shades purses and a host of other novelty items historically the price of wild gar meat sold commercially to wholesale distributors has fluctuated between lb up to lb retail prices in supermarkets and specialty stores have ranged from to lb atractosteus gars including alligator gar tropical gars and cuban gars are considered good candidates for aquaculture particularly in developing regions where their rapid growth disease resistance easy adaptation to artificial feeds as juveniles and ability to tolerate low water quality are essential their ability to breathe in both air and water eliminates the need for costly aeration systems and other technology commonly used in aquaculture despite being considered trash or rough fish in most of north america in regions of central america and the southern united states they have become a popular food fish maintaining wild populations of gars has grown in importance to maintaining sustainable aquaculture for local food production the aquarium trade and conservation of biodiversity aquaria despite the large size alligator gar can attain they are kept as aquarium fish though many fish labeled as alligator gar in the aquarium trade are actually smaller species alligator gar require a very large aquarium or pond and ample resources for them to thrive in captivity they are also a popular fish for public aquaria and zoos in many areas keeping alligator gar as pets is illegal but they occasionally show up in fish stores alligator gar are highly prized and sought after for private aquaria particularly in japan according to some reports large alligator gar could fetch as much as us40000 in what some consider the japanese black market in june three men from florida and louisiana were indicted on charges of illegally removing wild alligator gar from the trinity river in texas and attempting to ship them to japan for private collectors the indictments resulted from an undercover sting operation by special agents with the us fish and wildlife service the texas parks and wildlife department and the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission the charges included violations of three separate provisions of the lacey act specifically conspiracy to submit a false label for fish transported in interstate commerce conspiracy to transport fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation and conspiracy to transport and sell fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation two of the conspirators entered guilty pleas to one count and the government dropped the other two charges against them a third conspirator went to trial on all three counts was acquitted on one count and found guilty on two the district court sentenced him to serve nine months in prison followed by one year of supervised release the case was appealed and on april 2014 the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court references further reading external links

extraordinary fish from rivers all around the world oh oh oh fish that can be described as real monsters normally i have to travel halfway round the world to find my quarry here we go the biggest some would say baddest freshwater fish on the planet its not often i hear of a river monster in my own backyard but this is exactly whats happened a report in a german newspaper says swimmers are being attacked in a lake outside berlin this isnt a far-off exotic place a river monster within miles of a 21st-century european capital can it really be true its an opportunity not to be missed im already packing my equipment i have my suspicions as to the identity of the culprit and if im*****************its a fish with a monstrous reputation chronicled since medieval times there it is there it is there it is the wels is europes largest freshwater fish capable of reaching over pounds ive been doing some research into this predatory member of the catfish family and im finding that ever since records began europe seems to have had its very own well-documented freshwater man-eater it appears the wels catfish is actually no stranger to making front-page news there are stories about this species going back literally for centuries portraying it as a man-eating monster ive been doing a bit of research quite frankly i had no idea it had such a reputation back in the 1500s a human head*****************and human body parts turning up in wels stomachs have been reported across eastern europe from russia to poland through the ages right up to the present day i recently came across this report in a german newspaper of swimmers in a lake being attacked by what is thought to be a large wels catfish im on my way to germany to investigate these attacks and maybe solve the mystery of a serial killer with its roots in europes medieval past germany is at the forefront of urban expansion although steeped in history it is now coated in glass and steel hardly the place for a man-eating monster schlachtensee is a lake just minutes from berlins city center and its just become germanys very own loch ness this is where the attacks are happening over a mile long and up to feet across the lake was formed in the last*****************age these cold waters have always been a refuge for wels catfish and falling to over feet in places its plenty deep enough to hide an absolute monster the attacks were localized concentrated in two small areas strangely areas according to the local fishermen not traditionally the places to hunt for wels so just what happened im going to ask one of the victims jonas fei what exactly did you do when you came down that day maybe two or three months ago i was swimming or seconds out on the lake suddenly something big bit me i dont know what it was but it was a very big shock for me pain and shock it hurts very much*****************course almost exactly here yes right here in a freshwater lake so far from the sea the last thing you would expect is to get attacked by a fish its just not supposed to happen being bitten by a wels is to experience the power of two hard plates packed with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth huge jaw muscles create a crushing force a bite is like being grabbed by a vise covered in coarse sandpaper before this happened you used to quite enjoy coming here of course every day i would swim in here but after that yeah i dont swim again normally about or people are swimming here so definitely people have been put off you think yes*****************snake in the water yeah then suddenly there was something on my leg then there was a wound on my leg there was blood there were two parts that part here and the other one on the other side i went to the hospital with my mother they reacted really shocked the doctors because theyve never seen anything like that before and there were other attacks the same pattern each time swimmers bitten on their legs sent terrified out of the water bleeding will these 21st-century attacks prove that this european river monster is no medieval myth what i want to find out is what provoked these attacks and are wels catfish really capable of what they stand accused of lets have this to find out whats going on below im working with my cameraman simon and a mini submarine we have also enlisted the help of dr christian wolter*****************the berlin fisheries to give me an expert opinion were here to examine the scene of the crime and see whether knowledge of the biology of the wels could explain what exactly happened to trigger such aggression thats about meters out isnt that that is about where the boy said he was attacked what we could do is take it down there just over a meter yeah youre straight in weed at a meter depth yeah thats okay id have thought youd be out of your depth you could stand up in that water couldnt you almost yeah so its weedy and shallow but for dr wolter this is just the information he needs to understand what is going*****************the wels were just doing what every parent does protecting their offspring the swimmers had trespassed into their nursery so is there anything special or unusual about where they took bites do you think its a common spawning place thats why it might be the reason why it occurred so close to the bank the place that weve heard about the attacks happening that would be a potential spawning place catfish is a plant spawner they build nests in the plants where they lay their egg and then they guard in there then its the only explanation that it was during the breeding time that they had the nests there were guarding the nest and attacked something which comes*****************close for this particular catfish it was a huge stress to guard the nest and have all those swimmers around so it was actually a provoked attack it was protecting the nest freshwater crayfish and other fish will eat eggs from an unguarded nest to prevent this the male catfish sits over its yellow eggs protecting them from all comers large or small there are two essential qualities that make a man-eater wels catfish certainly have the attitude but do they have the capacity do they literally have the stomach for the job as a younger angler i caught smaller wels but how big do they need to get to pose a serious threat to a human theres no*****************fishing over the attack sites breeding is over ive hooked up with local fisherman hoss statugy he knows where the wels are likely to be now me too but first weve got to get over the language barrier yeah um um um oh hey right ah oh i understand hes a butcher okay so now just fishing fishing huh right okay one glove no good not enough always with two one glove the fish can twist and twist you around so we have two gloves finally with the best spots pinpointed we want to start fishing at dusk so this is the place to fish wels are night stalkers their bodies are bulging with sensory receptors the lateral line*****************all fish have allows them to sense water vibrations but catfish also have extra receptors in their skin those tentacles are more than just feelers they can taste the water for slight chemical changes any clue that leads them to a meal which can be anything from fish to crustaceans even water birds when youre up against these super senses fishing gear for wels needs to be tough but you also need a bit of delicacy ive got very strong 80-kilo breaking strain braided line there so you can literally just hang on you dont have to let them take any line at all you just hang on and try and stop them getting anywhere near that wood float*****************slides but only up as whoops only up as far as the knot going down to a fairly big single hook and something on that hook that smells tasty so a dead fish as bait should hopefully draw a large catfish in the schlachtensee catfish prove elusive but my trip has not been wasted i have confirmed that these fish have an aggressive attitude it seems that these attacks in berlin werent predatory in their intent but defensive territorial behavior at breeding time but thats actually academic as far as the victims were concerned they came away with bleeding wounds on their legs which underlines the chilling truth a large wels catfish has both the size and the fearlessness*****************be a potential man-eater if theres one place where im gonna find out just how big the wels catfish grows and how potentially dangerous it is its here the rio ebro in northern spain the fish was introduced its been here a little more than years but in that time you know theyre catching fish bigger than i am i mean theyre growing massive so although part of me is a little bit dubious about coming here because it is an artificial situation im also quite excited because i think theres a very good chance that in the next few days im gonna see a seriously big fish on the end of my line northern spain the river ebro*****************a german scientist came here and released some wels into this river ever since not only have they grown in numbers but also in size the wels has become spains very own frankenstein monster there are three reasons why the wels catfish are growing so big in this river its a mixture of man-made and natural for a start youve got three of these huge dams and it just means theres so much more water more space for the fish to live in on top of that this water is hot the fish being a cold-blooded animal can just feed and grow for more months of the year than they do in eastern europe and in berlin this place*****************stuffed with fish anyway particularly carp the anglers are coming in theyre throwing in huge amounts of bait and just sending the whole system into hyperdrive this river has a policy of catch and release so every year the biggest fish are even bigger than the year before monsters of over pounds already prowl these waters wels can live to years such fish are a massive lure to fishermen from all over the world to test just how voracious these catfish are i head into one of the ebros swollen tributaries my guide tells me the fish are lurking right in at the margins theyre waiting to ambush fish in the current and also to grab anything that drops*****************from the banks very energetic active fishing thats quite precise as well on the move not sitting around waiting and its the kind of fishing where youre left in no doubt if youve got a bite youre gonna see it feel it hear it as something just launches itself at this and sort of wrenches on the rod ah yes yes yes yes were going downstream watch the oar watch the oar all right aah gone gone gone gone gone hey im not doing very well everythings happening too quickly this is the last place id expect to find a fat wallowing catfish but it shows how you can misjudge these guys im learning that theres more to wels*****************than i thought aah yes yes yes yes yes open the reel open the reel off off off off off its off again aah its off literally took within about a second of the lure hitting the water about inches from the bank this water is cracking along at such a rate this is like a fast running pace thats the place let it sink a little bit and then twitch a little bit you see that thats coming direct the fish is in the water we let it sink and pow absolutely two strikes on that fish damn the wels have made themselves totally at home here not just in the main channels but throughout the whole river*****************as apex predators they have a confidence that im about to witness firsthand these fish are scared of nothing look at this thats a big fish i could almost reach down and grab its mouth do you have a calamari theres a catfish here its big its pounds plus it is two feet beneath me the bank goes down here i am looking into its mouth i could almost reach down and touch it well the fish has backed off i think he could see me im gonna throw this really hard no reaction no reaction the fish is just melting away backwards this is a really rare sight that fish is foot long its about pounds at least*****************it was in the margins and i could see the whole fish there it is thats a sight that is a rare sight that is a big fish if i got down on my knees then i could have patted him on the head mouth like that right underneath me and looking down on its back this wonderful light camo pattern this disruptive sort of black and white threw a stone to see if there would be a reaction no he just reversed back and then under the boat and away i really like seeing fish like that its fantastic really good any other fish would have been spooked off by that stone it would have disappeared in a*****************and that guy is not even a really big one im on the banks of the river ebro in spain hunting down giant wels catfish theyre estimated to put on up to pounds a year if thats true it wont be long before an ebro wels reaches the man-eating proportions of medieval folklore if im after a man-eater i need to catch at the very least a man-sized fish one that falls on the fat side of pounds its time to rig up rather than casting we drop our baits over yards out just short of the sunken trees along the flooded river channel take up the slack then with the high-tech alarms set i can enjoy the spanish*****************and now we wait this is not my preferred fishing technique i like to feel the line be in contact with the bait but wels are not delicate feeders and besides its hot here yes here here and its about to get hotter thats taking line thats taking line thats taking line this is my first supersized spanish wels and immediately it feels seriously big this is physical physical stuff a serious burst from that fish when it first took its already taking line on us stick it out my forearm is almost cramping up its a good size have you got the fish i did get it feels like yeah he was moving up the side these spanish*****************are hunting in broad daylight they really are breaking their programming and these fish even seem used to being handled my first fish is pounds and measures foot inches if these fish are putting on pounds a year then in years this already massive creature could weigh as much as pounds more than double its present size and if they do live until years ill let you do the maths the only thing that will restrict them is food but there is one food supply here that is in huge quantities other catfish the wels is not just a man-eater its a cannibal just getting sort of a cool scientific look at this animal i mean the first thing*****************the thing to do start at the business end the head i mean the main thing is just this very very wide mouth about inches across on this animal and youve got needlelike teeth they are sharp as well you put your hand in there and theyll draw blood but in terms of getting a grip just perfect if they clamp down tight with those sort of jaw muscles youre not gonna get out of that theyre just purpose-built for lurking on the bottom and grabbing stuff that comes above them and theyre gonna know that stuff is there the prey because their eyes are on top of their head but more to the point theyve got these and*****************are just you know this is like sort of extra-sensory perception you can tell whats going on in the water these will pick up vibrations and also chemicals in very very sensitive very small quantities in both cases on the side youve got very pronounced on this animal the lateral line and this is their super organ the super-touch organ it just picks up vibrations in the water you know often again at a very low level and also you can see here these sort of marks on the skin now i think these are probably wounds from another fish possibly when this fish was spawning and you know they got a little bit too rough a little bit*****************of over-enthusiastic stomach here theres the vent there so actually if it swallows something this fish could potentially swallow something that long it goes to the back of the throat which is here it opens up this sort of sphincter muscle there and it could swallow something about two foot long so no problem accommodating those medieval accounts of babies and small children in the belly of the beast it looks like wels catfish can swallow prey roughly a third of their own body length so if these fish in the ebro keep on growing its possible that they could reach a size where they will have man-eating potential fact is following close on the heels of what was*****************thought to be fiction looking at this fish it is the perfect predator i mean they do eat anything literally anything but they are perfectly equipped to predate and also to come from underneath you know that is just a mouth on the end of a solid sinuous piece of muscle anyway i cant hold him much longer wels like all catfish could live quite a long time out of water if kept cool and wet this guy seems quite reluctant to leave shall i leave him there a nice rub on his belly in a split second the fish turns im just quick enough to escape that was the first catfish attack on a human on-camera i was*****************wondering is he gonna move and he did sort of double round and i have heard stories of them actually having a bite of somebody whos caught them so i thought thats not gonna happen to me theres no mark there theres no mark there but it has happened i fish on into darkness and i get another surprise its just pulled me on my ass fish on me pulled towards the water i thought i was gonna go in there theres nothing thats a sizeable fish sizeable fish with so many fishermen around the only inconvenience these fish suffer for their midnight feasts is a little bit of manhandling imagine being in a river at night with one*****************these things swimming around your legs i dont know how big it is yet i can see its big right yep i think how wide its about nine inches isnt it mm-hmm this fish is almost as heavy as i am i mean it is this is quite a monstrous beast and the power as well i felt the power the thing nearly pulled me in the river so you know definitely a fierce predatory animal and some of these stories about them maybe attacking swimmers i dont know i can believe them now having actually seen the size of one of these things actually up close im still short of my target 150-pound beast these creatures really are*****************out of the water i want to see them in their natural element but that means getting into the water cameraman simon and i are going to try an experiment i want to see and film a wels catfish underwater i want to see exactly how europes biggest freshwater predator operates in its element what i really want to see is the moment when the wels gets to strike its prey it isnt gonna be easy this is something that very very few people get to see but i do have a few ideas about what i can use to tempt the fish in this is the camera and this is whats gonna be behind the boat and about*****************feet behind this is gonna be the lure so its gonna be looking back thing is this is actually quite a lump of a camera even though its a small camera so i think here we go floatation two if we need them two tanks and to stop it wibble-wobbling around a little bit because were angling there we go one of those and that will just keep it flying straight and level and well lob that off the back of the boat and well see the lure and hopefully well see something come up and grab the bait ill need to hang on otherwise you know if something big takes this you know the whole monitor could go*****************this is actually working really well ive got the lure in picture its bang in the middle of the screen im actually watching you know normally its just there and youve no idea whats happening i can actually see my lure out behind the boat a fish i think it was a carp yeah oh were bumping over the bottom oh dear whats going on there right need to in a bit in a bit in a bit its bumping its bumping ive lost the lure havent i ive lost the lure i think the camera might have been bashed around a bit though aah not robust enough unfortunately to withstand being bashed along the bottom but other than*****************actually doing very well before that there was this gray shadow that appeared from nowhere which sort of came and went and it could have been a catfish investigating it and shying off at the last minute or it could have just been a rock going past i dont know what im about to see is another unexpected aspect of these fishes behavior what were doing is were doing something called clonking and its sending a sound wave down into the water and we can see on the sonar - oh yeah - yeah yeah this is a fish oh yes yes yes catfish yeah yeah yeah on your lures oh there it is there it is ive got*****************theres a catfish theres a catfish see him yeah its right under the lure yeah fantastic i see him on the sonar yeah yeah there he is there he is tentacles thats big yeah yeah yeah yeah right whats happened now and its coming up now right in the middle of the screen fantastic look at that hes attacking the camera what this has just demonstrated is that when youve got splashing when youve got commotion on the surface the catfish which they live on the bottom they will come up to investigate ah yes yes yes yes yes bottom of the screen there it is there it is there it is look at that there it is oh*****************come off come off this is amazing getting a fish on-camera taking a bait attracted in by sound and vibration like sharks to a plane crash these fish fear nothing it even attacks the camera its been really good though just to actually see what ive seen on the screen very very rare to see this fish behavior so i feel sort of quite privileged to have seen that although we didnt get a fish into the boat i actually feel it was a successful day because i feel that ive actually learnt a lot about the behavior particularly how they react to vibration to commotion on the surface heres this fish that lives on the bottom but if*****************hears something it comes up and the tentacles are waving and it investigates without the camera under the water you just assume that nothing is happening as soon as you put the camera there dangling under the boat youre making the noise with the clonk theyre coming up into the middle of the water and they wont know whats going on everything ive seen so far the reaction of the wels catfish to a bait in the water confirms its aggression as a top predator and also its fearlessness combine that with supersizing and youve got a creature that you really wouldnt want to get too close to in the water what i want to know now is just*****************big a wels would need to be to tackle me in the water ive said they look like giant slugs but in their element theyre like super-sensitive sharks time for another experiment like most people if i jump in the water i dont sink i float even after a heavy lunch and its not too difficult im flapping my arms a little bit and my legs but the question is how big would a fish need to be to pull me under right ive got one dive weight on at the moment pounds and i can support it actually thats harder its harder pounds now doubling the rate of paddling but i can still just about keep myself on*****************surface right i can support pounds with a bit of flapping and flailing of my legs weve just weighed this rock this is gonna make it up to pounds ill just see how i do against that combined weight in the water that was actually very interesting pounds of weight attached to me i could just about keep my head above-water it was a struggle i reckon another pounds and id have just gone no matter how much my arms and legs would have been flailing around and thats interesting cause if you ask most people how big a fish would have to be to pull a body underwater theyd say probably something about the same size as that*****************now i weigh about pounds and on land i can take care of myself but in the water you know a fish would just have to exert a pull of pounds about of my body weight and i wouldnt stand a chance id just be gone and if i took a lungful of water underneath there then nobody would ever see me again okay that just goes to show that it doesnt need to be a huge fish to pull me under lets have a closer look at pulling power that pounder pulled me off my feet and almost into the water how much force can i generate i couldnt even pull in our director and shes half my*****************shes a match for me even one-handed so i could be pulled under the water by a fish just half my size to pounds and the thing about the ebro is that the river is just full of fish that size and much bigger which possibly explains why you dont see very many people swimming with only a few days left in northern spain im trying to break the 150-pound marker that i have set myself my respect for these fish over the past few days has really grown oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh aah aah if this one pulls me over im in real trouble im nearly tipping forward over that edge and*****************just gonna move a bit my groin is starting to ache there it is the rods jammed in its just physical stuff physical work its coming up strong fish but i think yeah its tiring tiring tiring there it is theres the fish hey good grief my crotch is killing me and there it is but does it weigh more than pounds get a measure of the beast that is foot 4 foot inches let me open the mouth you can actually hear the echo coming out of the mouth there hello hello i can see its gullet opening and closing if i was so inclined i could put my fist down there quite easily that is an eating*****************the whole thing is nearly foot of just solid rippling muscle if that grabbed hold of your leg thats an unpleasant-enough thought but if that decided not to let go and you were swimming youd be history im about pounds on a good day or a bad day depending how you look at it this fish could be more than that yeah kilos thats about pounds not quite as big and fat and ugly as i am what i find really hard to credit when i was doing those experiments where i was trying to see how much force i could exert in the water and there was somebody on the bank with a spring balance just hooked round*****************finger reading off okay or pounds this thing in the water is almost pulling me off the bank i was having to dig in and really act like i was in a tug-of-war how something with nothing solid to actually grab hold of can exert that force in the water you know i find quite mind-boggling it is very very impressive indeed and now its time to let this guy go lets see how he reacts fish has recovered a bit maybe a bit more than i have im gonna put it back in the water if it does have a go at me im gonna actually stand my ground and a bit like an elephant see if it*****************a false charge or will it actually go and grab my leg this is what im trying to remember that this fish is bigger than i am its got a few inches on me ive got a few pounds on this fish but im in the water my extra weight actually counts for nothing its the fishs environment sinking down towards my foot i think i think my reflexes overruled what i wanted to do which was stand my ground but i can visualize it too much what might be going on down there what might be going through its mind so dont tangle with these guys in their environment is the message wels catfish are predators with a*****************of attitude two of the fish that i caught turned on me while i was releasing them but as far as eating people a wels will swallow anything that fits inside its monstrous gut ah yes yes yes and if that includes you well its no respecter of species it seems that if they ever went away these medieval monsters are now back alive and well and still growing in the river ebro in northern spain this is quite a monstrous beast if i came back here in or years i think its possible there could be something in here that is bigger than anything thats ever existed before and in the not-too-distant future a baby-snatching man-eating wels could,the alligator gar atractosteus spatula is a euryhaline ray-finned fish in the clade ginglymodi of the infraclass holostei being most closely related to the bowfins it is the largest species in the gar family lepisosteidae and is among the largest freshwater fishes in north america the fossil record traces its groups existence back to the early cretaceous over million years ago gars are often referred to as primitive fishes or living fossils because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks and the ability to breathe in both air and water their common name was derived from their resemblance to the american alligator particularly their broad snouts and long sharp teeth it is suggested that an alligator gar can grow up to ft m in length the body of an alligator gar*****************torpedo-shaped usually brown or olive colored fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface in very rare occurrences they can also be black seen in gars that have a high level of melanin their scales are not like the scales of other fishes rather they are ganoid scales which are bone-like rhomboidal-shaped scales often with serrated edges and covered by an enamel-like substance ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and are excellent protection against predation unlike other gar species the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a dual row of large sharp teeth that are used to impale and hold prey alligator gar are stalking ambush predators primarily piscivores but they also ambush and eat waterfowl and small*****************they find floating on the waters surface populations of alligator gar have been extirpated from much of their historic range as a result of habitat destruction indiscriminate culling and unrestricted harvests populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the united states extending into mexico they are considered euryhaline because they can adapt to varying salinities ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes estuaries and bays along the gulf of mexico for nearly a half century alligator gar were considered trash fish or a nuisance species detrimental to sport fisheries and were targeted for elimination by state and federal authorities in the united states the 1980s brought a better understanding of the ecological balance necessary*****************sustain an ecosystem and an awareness that the alligator gar is an important element of the ecosystems they inhabit was eventually understood over time alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies they are also protected under the lacey act which makes transporting certain species of fish in interstate commerce illegal when in violation of state law or regulation several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public alligator gar are being cultured in ponds pools raceways and tanks by federal hatcheries for mitigation stocking by universities for research purposes and in mexico for consumption anatomy alligator gar are the largest species in*****************gar family and among the largest freshwater fishes found in north america mature alligator gar commonly measure ft m in length and weigh over lb kg however anecdotal reports suggest they can grow up to ft m in length and weigh as much as lb kg the largest alligator gar officially recorded was inadvertently caught in the net of fisherman kenny williams of vicksburg mississippi while he was fishing the oxbow lakes of the mississippi river on february williams was pulling up his net on lake chotard expecting to find buffalo fish but instead discovered a large alligator gar tangled in his net the gar was ft in m long weighed lb kg and its girth was in cm*****************to wildlife officials the fish was estimated to be between and years old one report estimated the gars age to be at least williams donated it to the mississippi museum of natural science in jackson where it will remain on display all gars have torpedo-shaped bodies but some distinguishing characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size heavy bodies broad heads short broad snouts large sharp teeth and a double row of teeth on their upper jaws they are usually brown or olive colored fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface the dorsal and anal fins are positioned toward the back of their bodies and their caudal fins are abbreviate heterocercal or nonsymmetrical physiology alligator gar*****************gills but unlike other species of fish with few exceptions they also have a highly vascularized swim bladder lung that supplements gill respiration the bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air this capability allows alligator gar to inhabit stagnant andor insufficiently aerated bodies of water that are poorly oxygenated or hypoxic in which most other fishes would die of suffocation due to a lack of dissolved oxygen within the water the swim bladder is connected to their fore gut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the waters surface an action seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern united states during the hot*****************the scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales gar bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are rhomboidal-shaped often with serrated edges and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel making them nearly impenetrable taxonomy and evolution lacepede first described the alligator gar in the original name was lepisosteus spatula but was later changed by eo wiley in to atractosteus spatula to recognize two distinct taxa of gars synonyms of atractosteus spatula include lesisosteus sic ferox rafinesque and lepisosteus spatula lacepede fossils from the order lepisosteiformes have been collected in europe from*****************cretaceous to oligocene periods in africa and india from the cretaceous and in north america from the cretaceous to recent times the lepisosteidae are the only extant family of gars with seven species all located in north and central america the fossil record traces the existence of gars such as the alligator gar back over million years ago to the early cretaceous period despite being a highly evolved species alligator gar are often referred to as primitive fishes or living fossils because they have retained a few morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors with seemingly few to no apparent changes such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks an abbreviate heterocercal*****************and a swim bladder lung for breathing in both air and water feeding behavior alligator gar are relatively passive seemingly sluggish solitary fish but voracious ambush predators they are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores but gar will also ambush and eat water fowl other birds turtles and small mammals that may be floating on the surface their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach the gar will then lunge forward and with a sweeping motion grab their prey impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth diet studies have shown alligator gar to be opportunistic piscivores and even scavengers depending on the*****************of their preferred food source they occasionally ingest sport fish but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on forage fishes such as gizzard shad as well as invertebrates and water fowl however brackish water populations of alligator gar

as with most ancestral species alligator gar are long-lived and sexually late maturing most females do not reach sexual maturity until after their first decade of life while males reach sexual maturity in half that time the conditions must be precise for a successful*****************to occur preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended photoperiod and rising water temperatures but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event when rivers rise and spread over the floodplain they create oxbow lakes and sloughs and inundate terrestrial vegetation which in turn provides protection and a nutrient-rich habitat for larval fish and fry once the water temperature has reached to f to c and all the other criteria are met gar move into the grassy weed-laden shallows to spawn actual spawning occurs when males gather around gravid females and begin writhing twisting bumping into and slithering over the tops of females an activity which triggers the release of eggs males release clouds of milt*****************fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column the sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation and development begins only a few days are needed for the eggs to hatch into larval fish and another days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry egg production is variable and believed to be dependent on the size of the female a common formula used for predicting the number of eggs a female can produce is eggsgram of body weight which gives an average of about eggs per spawn the

european maneater,wels catfish,silurus glanis,the amazon river is home to a terrifying collection of man-eating monsters and in the darkest corners lurks a dinosaur legends tell of an evil spirit inhabiting an enormous fish longer than a man it is encased in thick scales and it crushes its prey with a tongue made of bone but with a body of pure muscle its primary weapon is raw power im jeremy wade biologist and extreme angler and ive encountered this creature once before hey that time i came out second best but now im ready for the rematch yes ive been coming to the amazon for years and a tale ive heard many times is that of a fisherman going missing far from home on a remote tributary of the amazon something happens people tell of a creature leaping out of the water knocking the fisherman from his canoe but with no eyewitnesses the list of suspects is speculative at best could there really be a monster in the amazon capable of doing this and if so what kind of beast could it be anaconda caiman piranha are all convicted killers but in my travels around the world ugh ugh ive caught some supersized freshwater fish that are more than capable of doing the job is there one more river monster to add to the list of the amazons usual suspects a creature that has somehow slipped through the net the story of a canoe found floating nobody in it fisherman disappeared the automatic assumption from everybody was that it was a caiman or an anaconda those are the obvious candidates but ive been doing a bit of thinking and i think another animal might have been involved and what i think it might have been is one of these now i mean this is a real armor coat this and it looks as if its a snake or some other reptile but believe it or not this is actually a fish and this is a big fish this is the skin of an arapaima fish and if its scales make you think of a dinosaur thats because the arapaima is indeed a dinosaur of sorts it has swum in these waters virtually unchanged since the cretaceous period that is just a single scale from this animal i mean you know that is pretty impressive but they go a lot bigger than that and the reason i know that is that now whatever that came off that would have been a serious river monster arapaima have been caught measuring up to foot long making them the largest freshwater fish in the worlds largest river but in recent years they have been relentlessly overfished and today they are so rare it is forbidden to catch them in most areas however they are potentially found throughout the countless thousand miles of river that make up the amazon basin and i believe arapaima may be responsible for killing some of those missing people my mission is to investigate this theory and see if i can track down and even catch one of these potential killers ive begun my quest in manaus the wild west frontier town at the heart of the brazilian amazon i need to know what im dealing with and for that im going to visit some captive arapaima and i know just the place normally in the amazon seeing arapaima live and close up is pretty well impossible theres just so much water its pretty murky heres this place its a bar in the middle of manaus and this could be just the perfect place to check them out absolutely amazing opportunity to get eyeball-to-eyeball with these things it really is prehistoric-looking like stone or metal or something in a real armor plating and the other thing thats very striking about this fish they are very elongated theyre quite cylindrical that is just perfect design for an ambush predator you know speed over a short distance arapaima are naturally predatory engulfing any fish that fit into that bony mouth including piranha they will even consume birds and other animals sucking them down from the waters surface and then theyve got this very gruesome technique for actually finishing their prey off they have a tongue with a piece of bone inside it and they actually use that bony tongue to crush the small fish against the roof of the mouth so its not a very pleasant way to go id imagine these are pretty big fish you know that mouth isnt big enough to swallow a person so any stories like that youve really got to discount but it could still actually kill you that is a very solid lump of bone with an enormous mass of muscle behind it ive actually been on the receiving end of one of these things it hit me in the chest and no exaggeration i could still feel that a month and a half later it just bruised me so deeply it was seven years ago and i was helping a friend of mine a research scientist with his captive-breeding program for arapaima his long-term goal is to take the pressure off the wild population and he needed to capture his fish to pair them up with likely mates we caught several fish already and weighed and measured them without problem when i let my guard down while drawing in a net with an arapaima trapped inside this hard-nosed giant turned from fish into missile from nowhere i had pounds of solid bone smash into me weeks later a doctor described my injury as similar to the impact of striking the steering column during a car crash im not saying this is some malignant creature that will deliberately hunt and eat you it doesnt have the mouth for it but corner one of these beasts and it will launch a preemptive strike it is this event that makes me believe the arapaima may be the killer in question if these fishermen were hunting arapaima or accidentally caught one in a net this animal will violently defend itself just one thrash connecting with the head is all it would take to knock you unconscious leaving you at the mercy of the amazons scavenging river monsters if im going to investigate this theory i need to demonstrate that my experience wasnt a freak occurrence and arapaima do have the power the ability and even the intent to take a fisherman out but more importantly i need to prove that despite overfishing there are still arapaima out there large enough to do the damage and the best way i can do that is by catching a giant arapaima but as i set off on my mission leaving the port of manaus my boat captain tells me that if im interested in arapaima then i should definitely visit one of these floating houses salted arapaima used to be a meal enjoyed across the amazon but since a ban on commercial fishing a few enterprising riverinos or river people have started to farm them in pens like this to satisfy the demand for arapaima meat ive heard these arapaima in this enclosure here do something quite spectacular ive arrived just as theyre preparing to fish one out for their own cooking pot jeremy jeremy alegria alegria eh alegria senhor alegria which means happiness is about to try and get an arapaima out of here theres a few in here and he says its not an easy job it can be a wee bit interesting im going to ask him if maybe i can help there are fish in here and he says theyre just jumping everywhere and you know youre just having to duck you risk getting hit by the head and this is about the size of a boxing ring you know its like having people coming at you and just having to avoid them right im gonna have to just prepare myself a little bit suddenly all my old fears from my painful encounter are back but if im going to catch an arapaima capable of killing a man then i need to face up to my fear and if that means getting back into the water with one of these beasts then thats what im going to have to do having previously had a crippling personal encounter im on a mission to see if i can add the arapaima fish to the list of amazon river monsters with lethal potential and to do that i need to catch one of these giants but before i tackle one in the wild i need to lay the ghost of that earlier encounter to rest oh i just trod on a fish so im helping these guys net a captive arapaima ah this is t-t-t-t-the this is a bit like a boxing ring its about the same size theres fish in here nearly as big as i am its a simple matter of netting one but this is exactly what i was doing when i took the full force of an arapaima headbutt to the chest and i have been warned that these fish are particularly violent when cornered im walking forward which means all the vulnerable bits of me body you know a boxer would be covering them up okay thats going well theyre gonna start jumping any minute hes saying any minute theyre gonna start jumping okay we didnt get one gonna have to go through the whole thing again knowing whats coming makes the second attempt even more daunting im afraid jeremy is afraid hes saying i think that is fairly clear to see hes saying they might be a bit tired this time so they might oh theres no doubt that when cornered or trapped by nets the arapaima becomes a formidable force of nature with the help of these arapaima farmers im finally holding one of these incredible fish in my arms look at that fin aah hey my fear has been replaced with a new respect were gonna lift it up maybe im now ready to face an arapaima on my own now were gonna let the head go gonna let the head go this is the ooh they wanted one to eat that one was too big they want to get a smaller one i think im just going to leave them to it okay never ever seen anything like that before all those fish absolutely clean out of the water you know i think that just has to be you know the evidence that i was looking for just imagine the damage a fish could do that had the same solid-bone head but was more than twice the weight but senhor alegria also insists that they sneak through holes in the nets displaying a curiously unfishlike cunning combine that with their sheer muscular power and you can easily see how dangerous the arapaima becomes when cornered now i know what im dealing with but to catch one its gonna be a couple of days by boat to one of the few places where arapaima fishing is still allowed after a days traveling we stop at a riverside town to spend the night im not suggesting that the arapaima is responsible for all disappearances on the amazon this river has a full complement of killers as im powerfully reminded when asking around for any fishermens tales this man lost his wife to a horrifying attack by the south american cousin of the alligator the caiman just yards away his poor daughter could only helplessly look on this gentlemans wife went fishing on her way back the boat actually sort of went over the top of a caiman aah mae mae mae it hit the canoe tipped her into the water and then basically grabbed her mae the caiman had actually drawn away a little distance because of the commotion and the shouting and then her daughter was able to go around the other side and pull her to land but they just took so long to get help that despite rescuing her mother from the caiman you know she died of her wounds later on its one thing to hear secondhand stories about people being taken by animals in the water you know all very dramatic fishermens tales but to actually hear from somebody who actually saw their mother you know taken in front of them just really brings home just what a potentially dangerous place this is particularly if youre a fisherman something ive got to remember is that its not just dangerous fish that youve got in the water but theres a whole array of other nasty dangerous creatures down there my mission is to prove whether the arapaima deserves a place alongside the amazons undisputed freshwater killers and as i go deeper into the heart of the amazon in search of this fish i encounter the other creatures that come with this increasingly dangerous territory between and the average annual catch of arapaima was c tons the weight of jumbo jets this led to the commercial extinction of the arapaima in the wild fishermen that hunt the arapaima fish here in the amazon regularly expose themselves to river monsters that have no need to prove their deadly nature ive heard a tale of a killer caiman in these waters so i head out after dark to see if i can find it but it seems like im the one being watched there are eyes following my every move im out at night hunting caiman theres one in these waters apparently that is absolutely man-eating size they say its close to foot caimans eyes reflect my flashlight making them easy to spot oh theres one theres one theres one theres one theres one seeing how many caiman there are in these waters makes me realize that it is as much the company the arapaima keep that makes them such risky prey to hunt their fearsome defenses allow them to survive in these predatory waters but also as the arapaima becomes rarer and rarer it is pushed deeper into the literally uncharted reaches of the amazon this is where the deadly forces of nature lurk civilization is left behind and all medical assistance is well beyond reach but if im to catch a giant arapaima and lay my own demons to rest then im going to have to face these other monsters as well as i enter the dark heart of the amazon being such a rare animal nowadays limited and sustainable fishing is allowed in just a few locations and this is where im headed im as far off the beaten track as possible in search of those last places which still provide sanctuary to monsters basically theres no way we could get up here using the motor too many branches and rocks in the water so were having to manhandle the boat up this this very narrow creek weve entered a pristine magical world home to many mysterious jungle creatures and maybe maybe the large arapaima im after agh goodness me that is a fish and a half look at that this is a beautiful caparari oop right im actually very pleased to have this fish its not the arapaima i was after but you know this is just to my mind such a lovely-looking fish i mean the patterning on that is just wonderful this bizarre catfish is a strange monster of the deep but it seems that the arapaima is an elusive giant that wont be caught easily with the weather turning its time to rethink my options maybe i need to find someone who can advise me where exactly its best to fish as i race ahead of the storm deeper into the jungle im reminded of the legend that tells how this monster fish came into being pirarucu was the son of an indian chief known to be cruel and arrogant he was disrespectful of the gods so the highest god tupa decided to punish him he ordered storms to attack pirarucu on a fishing trip but pirarucu laughed them off so tupa struck him down with lightning dragged him to the bottom of the river and transformed him into a giant fish the arapaima or fire fish although to this day brazilians still call it pirarucu in the west we have lost much of our old reverence for the natural world but there are still remote tribal people for whom reality and myth are almost interchangeable the tribes of this region have a deep connection to the arapaima and are still allowed to hunt it for food so if im going to track one down and learn from the ancient ways im told there are no better teachers than the munduruku people im on a mission to catch the giant arapaima or fire fish a fish that i believe should be on the list of river monsters that cause human fatalities here in the amazon from experience both past and present i know just how powerful this creature is when cornered to prove that there are still arapaima out there that are big enough to inflict a deadly blow all i have to do is catch one getting to grips with arapaima in captivity is one thing but getting close to them in the wild is another thing entirely particularly now they are so endangered but there are some people further up this amazon backwater who do have a very ancient relationship with the arapaima and im hoping that when i get there im going to find out an awful lot more ive now been traveling for several days it feels like im light-years from civilization when i finally track down the munduruku people bom dia bom dia although often dressed in western clothes these days the mundurukus still retain their connection to wildlife and to the myths and legends of old it looks like i could be here at the right time a good time is right now when the waters down and the fish are actually concentrated aha-ha but lunch is on the go and this far from civilization the creatures of the forest like this tarantula are an everyday part of life that is a monster that is an absolute monster i hook up with manoel one of the villages top fishermen hes gonna take me out to see if we can spot some wild arapaima i want to learn all i can about the behavior and natural haunts of this river monster if im going to give myself the best chance of catching a good-sized arapaima what manoel has just told me is that to fish for arapaima the one thing that you really need is patience and im really really getting a sense of that just drifting slowly slowly watching for that one sign of the fish coming up to the surface arapaima are air-breathers an adaptation that allows them to live in the oxygen-depleted lakes that form in the amazons dry season but it is also a vital clue for fishermen every time they break the surface they give away their presence and when theyre actually not afraid or at all spooked you know that could be actually quite a gentle ripple for such a big fish its a small sign but it gives away their location the only problem is that it can be minutes or more between breaths so predicting where theyre going to come up next is not easy so there you are all day under the hot sun after this huge fish but you know not only is that down there theres all these other different river monsters in the water im often in large metal-hulled fishing boats so coming down to water level in these tiny canoes makes you feel very exposed and vulnerable im beginning to appreciate that how you see the natural world entirely depends on your perspective weve been paddling around here for a fair old while and hes actually seen pointed out a couple of fish surfacing but to be honest i actually couldnt see anything at all i think ive got quite a way to go until i properly get my eye in as we head back to the village my guide tells me about one river monster in particular that they fear its called the cobra-grande the big snake ive heard of this monster before and i thought it was a mythical oversized anaconda but i am told that several people here have actually seen it and that a nearby village had to totally relocate because they were so terrified of the big snake manoel here has actually seen a cobra-grande and it was actually on land so im very keen to get the details of this this sounds to be more than just a big anaconda this was a huge animal immense size great big head and this thing was black red and yellow and it was missing its tail apparently which is an odd detail but he obviously had a very good look at it the snake was just lying there looking out over the water these eyes like searchlights and apparently its head just covered in bees just black with bees but you know the animal just not bothered at all sounds farfetched but he actually saw this huge animal just down the bank from here he tells me that a few other people in the village saw the cobra-grande very recently this is an opportunity not to be missed i decide to put my arapaima hunt on hold to see if one of the amazons most unbelievable myths is in fact reality ive come to meet the munduruku people to try and catch the amazons biggest fish but as ive become immersed in their world and myths ive decided to put my arapaima hunt on hold to follow up a lead that might reveal another vast river monster the cobra-grande or big snake im on my way up a narrow winding creek in the middle of flooded forest except at the moment the water is very very low and im on my way to see the hole where a cobra-grande is supposed to live this is the giant snake which you know i thought was just purely a creature of myth but they said no no we are taking you to a place where people say there is one actually there now i was initially skeptical but their insistence is infectious if anywhere is going to be the home of a cobra-grande this place certainly does have that kind of feel to it were here with the amazon basin covering some million square miles there are without any doubt new species waiting to be discovered and who knows how big some of these animals might be they said that this line here is a track if this actually is the track of a snake it is a big heavy animal you know this is a seriously large track that its actually made in the ground here anacondas can reach around feet if that isnt a big snake i dont know what is but the locals say cobra-grande is far bigger than an anaconda yes that does actually look like the home of something judging by the size of the holes there you know it could have been something pretty large so here weve got a bit of shed snakeskin lets just pick a bit up and you can actually see the individual scales at some point quite a large snake lay here and shed its skin even though it sounds quite ugly theyre somewhat frustrated that it doesnt seem to be here today although there are very very definite signs that something large is around these parts if im to fish for a giant arapaima then i will be entering the home of monsters maybe i wont meet the cobra-grande on this trip but im finally grasping how myth and reality are intertwined for these people im sure i could spend a lifetime learning more and more about the arapaima and the creatures that share its mysterious world but its now time to put all i have gathered into practice this is actually a place where the tribespeople around here used to come before a big battle to focus the mind prepare themselves mentally beforehand and um i guess as im likely to need all the help that i can get you know its not a bad idea for me to just spend a few minutes here as well i know that if im going to be successful i need to understand and respect a fish that for the local tribes is the incarnation of a warrior mentally and physically prepared its game on its just me my guide johnny and out there somewhere a very big fish im putting into practice the things ive learnt not just from the fish in captivity but also the whole business about locating the fish spotting them patience you know gradually working close so that youre in a position of getting one on the line with the water so low in this lake oxygen levels are depleted the arapaimas air-breathing physiology is both its strength and its weakness it came into existence millions of years before there were hunters like me around scanning the waters surface for that telltale clue im told there is another small lake in the forest where modern line fishing is allowed for arapaima as long as its catch and release we cant take the canoe there but we can go on foot and the fact that its tucked away a little bit you know maybe theres gonna be something that i can get a bait out over there yes yes yes yes thats a fish ive heard tales of various amazon monsters on this journey some legendary some real and all dangerous but theres one creature that despite overfishing id love to prove really grows to mythic proportions its the arapaima a fish capable of knocking a man from his canoe and leaving him for dead but the only way i know how to prove these monsters are still out there is to catch one and ive heard of a lake that might be just the place to do that this lake looks really nice actually its very quiet lots of snags which could be interesting im actually using a thing called a circle hook now that looks like its just not gonna hook anything at all the point just coming in here thats just not gonna hook on anything but in fact if thats the fishs mouth what happens is it just comes and turns and there it is right in the corner of the mouth oh there we go that was one i just saw this red tail come up fraction of a second but i recognize it now that was an arapaima and what ive got to do is try and quietly get into position so i can actually put a bait near that fish one thing that i learned from the tribespeople which is actually quite hard to do but ive just got to be patient yes yes yes yes ah yeah thats a fish thats a good fish oh hes up i can see the fish as the battle with this arapaima approaches the half-hour mark im reminded that the rebellious proud spirit that inhabits this fish even refused to surrender to the gods right its got to be out there we go oh look at that it came out so easily okay were ready there it is look at that for a fish look at that massive female arapaima about pounds i finally have the proof in my arms that huge arapaima are still out here this is a true dinosaur of the deep i need this fish to regain its strength after our battle before i release it if i put it straight back it might not have the energy to swim to the surface to take a breath and being an air-breather it would drown just the head a little bit under the water and pointing up towards the bank so that if it does thrash theres only one way it can go in theory which is not back into the water although they can just double round degrees even at the end of a long fight i can still feel the strength of this fish so i can absolutely imagine this thing being able to oh there we go thats good thats good thats good bom that was the fish just having a breath which is excellent it means the fish is not too tired out but i mean mainly this fish is just a bony head with a big cylinder of muscle behind it if this fish wasnt tired out i dont think id be able to hold it thats good no its gone we were just wondering if it had enough strength to go and no doubt about it i just couldnt hold it and in fact at the end of an epic battle on the line but also an epic quest trying to find one of these things but you know finally feeling the strength of it absolutely im in no doubt now that if you were in a small fishing canoe and that thing hit you underneath it would easily upend the canoe and then if you were in the water afterwards and you got on the wrong side of that head my goodness that would absolutely take you out mythic and real beasts swirl around one another here in the amazon when people go missing there is usually talk of giant snakes and man-eating caiman i set out to show that the arapaima is an underestimated fish capable of extraordinary feats of strength if cornered trapped or netted it becomes a formidable opponent an airborne missile i knew i had to overcome my fear to prove my case i went back into the water and caught an ancient survivor that is part fish part legend and entirely worthy of a deadly reputation now this is a real river monster,the wels catfish or silurus glanis also called sheatfish or just wels is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central southern and eastern europe in the basins of the baltic black and caspian seas it has been introduced to western europe as a prized sport fish and is now found from the united kingdom east to kazakhstan and china and south to greece and turkey etymology the english common name comes from wels the common name of the species in german language wels is a variation of old high german wal from proto-germanic hwalaz the same source as for whale from proto-indo-european skwalos sheatfish evolution the earliest known fossil remains of the wels catfish are from the late miocene about million years ago of ukraine potentially slightly older but less well-preserved remains from 6-7 million years ago are also known from the same region during this time period the dominant catfish in eastern europe appears to have been the modern soldatovs catfish s soldatovi now only found in eastern asia which was better adapted to the warmer climate the wels catfish may have been restricted to a single refugium in the ponto-caspian region around this point during the pliocene the wels catfish appears to have expanded its range and gradually supplanted soldatovs catfish up to the latters extirpation from the region during the late pliocene it is thought that the more adaptable wels catfish was more tolerant to the cooling and drying trend over this period and the increased seasonality caused by it description the wels catfishs mouth contains lines of numerous small teeth two long barbels on the upper jaw and four shorter barbels on the lower jaw it has a long anal fin that extends to the caudal fin and a small sharp dorsal fin relatively far forward the wels relies largely on hearing and smell for hunting prey owing to its sensitive weberian apparatus and chemoreceptors although like many other catfish the species exhibits a tapetum lucidum providing its eyes with a degree of sensitivity at night when the species is most active with its sharp pectoral fins it creates an eddy to disorient its victim which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole the skin is very slimy skin colour varies with environment clear water will give the fish a black color while muddy water will often tend to produce green-brown specimens the underside is always pale yellow to white in colour albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally with an elongated body-shape wels are able to swim backwards like eels the female produces up to eggs per kilogram of body weight the male guards the nest until the brood hatches which depending on water temperature can take from three to ten days if the water level decreases too much or too fast the male has been observed to splash the eggs with its tail in order to keep them wet the wels catfish is a long-lived species with a specimen of years old having been captured during a recent study in sweden size the wels is one of the largest freshwater fish in europe and western asia only exceeded by the anadromous atlantic and beluga sturgeon most adult wels catfish are about m ft in ft in long fish longer than m ft in are a rarity at m ft in they can weigh kg lb and at m ft in they can weigh kg lb only under exceptionally good living circumstances can the wels catfish reach lengths of more than about m ft in examples include the record wels catfish of kiebingen near rottenburg germany which was m ft in long and weighed kg lb even larger specimens have been caught in poland m kg the czech republic m the dnieper river in ukraine the volga river in russia the ili river in kazakhstan france spain in the ebro italy in the po and arno serbia in gruza lake where a m ft in long specimen weighing kg lb was caught on june and the danube river where a catfish measuring m ft and weighing kg lb was caught at erdap gorge in the same year and greece where this fish was introduced a few decades ago greek wels grow well thanks to the mild climate lack of competition and good food supply the heaviest authenticated specimen captured from the river po by a hungarian fisherman in weighed kg lb although there are recent anecdotal reports of larger wels exceeding kg lb meanwhile the longest wels on record was an unweighed specimen from the po measuring m ft captured in the maximum total length may possibly exceed m ft with a maximum weight of over kg lb such lengths are rare and unproven during the last century but there is a somewhat credible report from the 19th century of a wels catfish of this size brehms tierleben cites heckls and kners old reports from the danube about specimens m ft long and kg lb in weight and vogts report of a specimen caught in lake biel which was m ft in long and weighed kg lb in k t kessler wrote about specimens from the dnieper river which were over m ft long and weighed up to kg lb according to the hungarian naturalist otto hermann 1835-1914 catfish of kilograms were also caught in hungary in the old centuries from the tisza river exceptionally large specimens are rumored to attack humans in rare instances this claim was investigated by extreme angler jeremy wade in an episode of the animal planet television series river monsters following his capture of three fish two of about kg lb and one of kg lb of which two attempted to attack him following their release a report in the austrian newspaper der standard on august mentions a wels catfish dragging a fisherman near gyor hungary under water by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold the man reported he barely escaped from the fish which he estimated to have weighed over kg lb diet like most freshwater bottom feeders the wels catfish lives on annelid worms gastropods insects crustaceans and fish larger specimens have also been observed to eat frogs snakes rats voles coypu and aquatic birds such as ducks even cannibalising on other catfish researchers at the university of toulouse france in documented individuals of this species in an introduced environment lunging out of the water to feed on pigeons at water edge of the beaching behaviour observed and filmed in this study were successful in bird capture stable isotope analyses of catfish stomach contents using carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 revealed a highly variable dietary composition of terrestrial birds this is likely the result of adapting their behaviour to forage on novel prey in response to new environments upon its introduction to the river tarn in since this type of behaviour has not been reported within the native range of this species they can also eat red worms in the fall but only the river species the wels catfish has also been observed taking advantage of large die-offs of asian clams to feed on the dead clams at the surface of the water during the daytime this opportunistic feeding highlights the adaptability of the wels catfish to new food sources since the species is mainly a nocturnal bottom-feeder distribution and ecology the wels catfish lives in large warm lakes and deep slow-flowing rivers it prefers to remain in sheltered locations such as holes in the riverbed sunken trees etc it consumes its food in the open water or in the deep where it can be recognized by its large mouth wels catfish are kept in fish ponds as food fish an unusual habitat for the species exists inside the chernobyl exclusion zone where a small population lives in abandoned cooling ponds and channels at a close distance to the decommissioned power plant these catfish appear healthy and are maintaining a position as top predators in the aquatic ecosystem of the immediate area as introduced species there are concerns about the ecological impact of introducing the wels catfish to regions where it is not native following the introduction of wels catfish populations of other fish species have undergone steep declines since its introduction in the mequinenza reservoir in it has spread to other parts of the ebro basin including its tributaries especially the segre river some endemic species of iberian barbels genus barbus in the cyprinidae that were once abundant especially in the ebro river have disappeared due to competition with and predation by wels catfish the ecology of the river has also changed with a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae the wels catfish may have established a population in santa catarina brazil they were imported from hungary in and were washed into the itajai-acu river after a flood caused their tanks to overflow in a specimen weighing kg lbs and m ft long was captured in blumenau suggesting the catfish have survived and possibly be reproducing conservation status although silurus glanis is not considered globally endangered the conservation status varies across the species native distribution range in the northern periphery of the distribution the species has been declining over the last centuries and was extinct from denmark in the 1700s and from finland in the 1800s in sweden it persists only in a few lakes and rivers and is now considered as near threatened recent genetic studies have furthermore found that the swedish populations harbors low genetic diversity and are genetically isolated and differentiated from each other highlighting the need for conservation attention as food only when younger is the wels generally valued as food the flesh is more palatable when the fish weighs less than kg lb larger than this size the fish is highly fatty and additionally can be loaded with toxic contaminants through bioaccumulation due to its position at the top of the food chain large specimens are not recommended for consumption but are sought out as sport fish due to their combativeness a common lure for wels catfish is a clonk which when dropped in the water produces a distinct sound that induces them to bite attacks on people tabloids regularly report attacks caused by various catfish that primarily affected animals often only the role of the catfish was presumed in april an austrian fisherman was allegedly attacked by a catfish in one of the fishing lakes in per near gyor hungary however the man reportedly managed to break free the wels was the subject of an episode in the first season of the documentary television show river monsters host jeremy wade concluded that wels catfish in the area were not large enough to consume adult human beings but could easily swallow a child wade documented instances of wels catfish being aggressive towards humans including a wels he had just caught that doubled round and attempted to bite his calf similar stories occur in the works of older natural history writers alfred brehm a german naturalist published his famous work the world of animals in the 19th century it was also translated into hungarian at the beginning of the 20th century in this brehm or the compiling hungarian scientists write the following old gesners conrad gessner swiss naturalist claim that catfish doesnt spare humans either doesnt just belong in the realm of tales as we know of several cases that confirm that thus heckel and kner mention that a catfish was caught at bratislava in the stomach of which the remains of a child corpse were found fishermen credible to antipa probably romanian zoologist grigore antipa told me that children bathing in the stomachs of catfish were caught in the bones of their hands and feet - communicates vutskits probably hungarian zoologist huvutskits gyorgy - a romanian fisherman penetrated the middle of the danube with his boat because he wanted to take a bath while bathing a catfish caught his legs which he could no longer pull out of the mouth of this big-mouthed monster and so he got to the bottom of the water a few days later they came across the corpse of a dead fisherman whose legs were still in the catfishs mouth but even the greedy robber could not release his victims legs and drowned because of it in june a wels was shot at by a police officer after it had bitten five people in the brombachsee in northern bavaria the incident attracted media attention and sparked outrage on social media according to the police trying to kill the fish was necessary as it posed a threat to swimmers in the lake and to the guests of the burning beach electronic music festival nearby the injured fish was retrieved by fishermen and killed the animal rights group peta plans to file charges against the local fishing association and police department on claims that the killing was in breach of nature conservation laws related species aristotles catfish silurus aristotelis from greece the only other native european

tell of an evil spirit inhabiting an enormous fish longer than a man it is encased in thick scales and it crushes its prey with a tongue made of bone but with a body of pure muscle its primary weapon is raw power im jeremy wade biologist and extreme angler and ive encountered this creature once before hey that time i came out second best but now im ready for the rematch yes ive been coming to the amazon for years and a tale ive heard many times is that of a fisherman going missing far from home on a remote tributary of the amazon something happens people tell of a creature leaping out of the water knocking the fisherman from his canoe but with no eyewitnesses the list*****************suspects is speculative at best could there really be a monster in the amazon capable of doing this and if so what kind of beast could it be anaconda caiman piranha are all convicted killers but in my travels around the world ugh ugh ive caught some supersized freshwater fish that are more than capable of doing the job is there one more river monster to add to the list of the amazons usual suspects a creature that has somehow slipped through the net the story of a canoe found floating nobody in it fisherman disappeared the automatic assumption from everybody was that it was a caiman or an anaconda those are the obvious candidates but ive been doing*****************bit of thinking and i think another animal might have been involved and what i think it might have been is one of these now i mean this is a real armor coat this and it looks as if its a snake or some other reptile but believe it or not this is actually a fish and this is a big fish this is the skin of an arapaima fish and if its scales make you think of a dinosaur thats because the arapaima is indeed a dinosaur of sorts it has swum in these waters virtually unchanged since the cretaceous period that is just a single scale from this animal i mean you know that is pretty impressive*****************they go a lot bigger than that and the reason i know that is that now whatever that came off that would have been a serious river monster arapaima have been caught measuring up to foot long making them the largest freshwater fish in the worlds largest river but in recent years they have been relentlessly overfished and today they are so rare it is forbidden to catch them in most areas however they are potentially found throughout the countless thousand miles of river that make up the amazon basin and i believe arapaima may be responsible for killing some of those missing people my mission is to investigate this theory and see if i can track down and*****************to check them out absolutely amazing opportunity to get eyeball-to-eyeball with these things it really is prehistoric-looking like stone or metal or something in a real armor plating and the other thing thats very striking about this fish they are very elongated theyre quite cylindrical that is just perfect design for an ambush predator you know speed over a short distance arapaima are naturally predatory engulfing any fish that fit into that bony mouth including piranha they will even consume birds and other animals sucking them down from the waters surface and then theyve got this very gruesome technique for actually finishing their prey off they have a tongue with a piece of bone inside it and they actually use that bony tongue to crush the small fish against the roof of the mouth so its not a very pleasant way to go id imagine these are pretty big fish*****************know that mouth isnt big enough to swallow a person so any stories like that youve really got to discount but it could still actually kill you that is a very solid lump of bone with an enormous mass of muscle behind it ive actually been on the receiving end of one of these things it hit me in the chest and no exaggeration i could still feel that a month and a half later it just bruised me so deeply it was seven years ago and i was helping a friend of mine a research scientist with his captive-breeding program for arapaima his long-term goal is to take the pressure off the wild population and he needed to*****************his fish to pair them up with likely mates we caught several fish already and weighed and measured them without problem when i let my guard down while drawing in a net with an arapaima trapped inside this hard-nosed giant turned from fish into missile from nowhere i had pounds of solid bone smash into me weeks later a doctor described my injury as similar to the impact of striking the steering column during a car crash im not saying this is some malignant creature that will deliberately hunt and eat you it doesnt have the mouth for it but corner one of these beasts and it will launch a preemptive strike it is this event that makes me*****************the arapaima may be the killer in question if these fishermen were hunting arapaima or accidentally caught one in a net this animal will violently defend itself just one thrash connecting with the head is all it would take to knock you unconscious leaving you at the mercy of the amazons scavenging river monsters if im going to investigate this theory i need to demonstrate that my experience wasnt a freak occurrence and arapaima do have the power the ability and even the intent to take a fisherman out but more importantly i need to prove that despite overfishing there are still arapaima out there large enough to do the damage and the best way i can do that*****************by catching a giant arapaima but as i set off on my mission leaving the port of manaus my boat captain tells me that if im interested in arapaima then i should definitely visit one of these floating houses salted arapaima used to be a meal enjoyed across the amazon but since a ban on commercial fishing a few enterprising riverinos or river people have started to farm them in pens like this to satisfy the demand for arapaima meat ive heard these arapaima in this enclosure here do something quite spectacular ive arrived just as theyre preparing to fish one out for their own cooking pot jeremy jeremy alegria alegria eh alegria senhor alegria which means happiness is*****************to try and get an arapaima out of here theres a few in here and he says its not an easy job it can be a wee bit interesting im going to ask him if maybe i can help there are fish in here and he says theyre just jumping everywhere and you know youre just having to duck you risk getting hit by the head and this is about the size of a boxing ring you know its like having people coming at you and just having to avoid them right im gonna have to just prepare myself a little bit suddenly all my old fears from my painful encounter are back but if im going to catch*****************arapaima capable of killing a man then i need to face up to my fear and if that means getting back into the water with one of these beasts then thats what im going to have to do having previously had a crippling personal encounter im on a mission to see if i can add the arapaima fish to the list of amazon river monsters with lethal potential and to do that i need to catch one of these giants but before i tackle one in the wild i need to lay the ghost of that earlier encounter to rest oh i just trod on a fish so im helping these guys net a captive arapaima ah this is*****************this is a bit like a boxing ring its about the same size theres fish in here nearly as big as i am its a simple matter of netting one but this is exactly what i was doing when i took the full force of an arapaima headbutt to the chest and i have been warned that these fish are particularly violent when cornered im walking forward which means all the vulnerable bits of me body you know a boxer would be covering them up okay thats going well theyre gonna start jumping any minute hes saying any minute theyre gonna start jumping okay we didnt get one gonna have to go through the whole thing again knowing whats*****************makes the second attempt even more daunting im afraid jeremy is afraid hes saying i think that is fairly clear to see hes saying they might be a bit tired this time so they might oh theres no doubt that when cornered or trapped by nets the arapaima becomes a formidable force of nature with the help of these arapaima farmers im finally holding one of these incredible fish in my arms look at that fin aah hey my fear has been replaced with a new respect were gonna lift it up maybe im now ready to face an arapaima on my own now were gonna let the head go gonna let the head go this is the ooh*****************wanted one to eat that one was too big they want to get a smaller one i think im just going to leave them to it okay never ever seen anything like that before all those fish absolutely clean out of the water you know i think that just has to be you know the evidence that i was looking for just imagine the damage a fish could do that had the same solid-bone head but was more than twice the weight but senhor alegria also insists that they sneak through holes in the nets displaying a curiously unfishlike cunning combine that with their sheer muscular power and you can easily see how dangerous the arapaima becomes when cornered*****************i know what im dealing with but to catch one its gonna be a couple of days by boat to one of the few places where arapaima fishing is still allowed after a days traveling we stop at a riverside town to spend the night im not suggesting that the arapaima is responsible for all disappearances on the amazon this river has a full complement of killers as im powerfully reminded when asking around for any fishermens tales this man lost his wife to a horrifying attack by the south american cousin of the alligator the caiman just yards away his poor daughter could only helplessly look on this gentlemans wife went fishing on her way back the boat*****************sort of went over the top of a caiman aah mae mae mae it hit the canoe tipped her into the water and then basically grabbed her mae the caiman had actually drawn away a little distance because of the commotion and the shouting and then her daughter was able to go around the other side and pull her to land but they just took so long to get help that despite rescuing her mother from the caiman you know she died of her wounds later on its one thing to hear secondhand stories about people being taken by animals in the water you know all very dramatic fishermens tales but to actually hear from somebody who actually saw*****************mother you know taken in front of them just really brings home just what a potentially dangerous place this is particularly if youre a fisherman something ive got to remember is that its not just dangerous fish that youve got in the water but theres a whole array of other nasty dangerous creatures down there my mission is to prove whether the arapaima deserves a place alongside the amazons undisputed freshwater killers and as i go deeper into the heart of the amazon in search of this fish i encounter the other creatures that come with this increasingly dangerous territory between and the average annual catch of arapaima was c tons the weight of jumbo jets this led to*****************commercial extinction of the arapaima in the wild fishermen that hunt the arapaima fish here in the amazon regularly expose themselves to river monsters that have no need to prove their deadly nature ive heard a tale of a killer caiman in these waters so i head out after dark to see if i can find it but it seems like im the one being watched there are eyes following my every move im out at night hunting caiman theres one in these waters apparently that is absolutely man-eating size they say its close to foot caimans eyes reflect my flashlight making them easy to spot oh theres one theres one theres one theres one theres one seeing how*****************caiman there are in these waters makes me realize that it is as much the company the arapaima keep that makes them such risky prey to hunt their fearsome defenses allow them to survive in these predatory waters but also as the arapaima becomes rarer and rarer it is pushed deeper into the literally uncharted reaches of the amazon this is where the deadly forces of nature lurk civilization is left behind and all medical assistance is well beyond reach but if im to catch a giant arapaima and lay my own demons to rest then im going to have to face these other monsters as well as i enter the dark heart of the amazon being such a*****************animal nowadays limited and sustainable fishing is allowed in just a few locations and this is where im headed im as far off the beaten track as possible in search of those last places which still provide sanctuary to monsters basically theres no way we could get up here using the motor too many branches and rocks in the water so were having to manhandle the boat up this this very narrow creek weve entered a pristine magical world home to many mysterious jungle creatures and maybe maybe the large arapaima im after agh goodness me that is a fish and a half look at that this is a beautiful caparari oop right im actually very pleased to have*****************fish its not the arapaima i was after but you know this is just to my mind such a lovely-looking fish i mean the patterning on that is just wonderful this bizarre catfish is a strange monster of the deep but it seems that the arapaima is an elusive giant that wont be caught easily with the weather turning its time to rethink my options maybe i need to find someone who can advise me where exactly its best to fish as i race ahead of the storm deeper into the jungle im reminded of the legend that tells how this monster fish came into being pirarucu was the son of an indian chief known to be cruel and*****************he was disrespectful of the gods so the highest god tupa decided to punish him he ordered storms to attack pirarucu on a fishing trip but pirarucu laughed them off so tupa struck him down with lightning dragged him to the bottom of the river and transformed him into a giant fish the arapaima or fire fish although to this day brazilians still call it pirarucu in the west we have lost much of our old reverence for the natural world but there are still remote tribal people for whom reality and myth are almost interchangeable the tribes of this region have a deep connection to the arapaima and are still allowed to hunt it for food so if*****************going to track one down and learn from the ancient ways im told there are no better teachers than the munduruku people im on a mission to catch the giant arapaima or fire fish a fish that i believe should be on the list of river monsters that cause human fatalities here in the amazon from experience both past and present i know just how powerful this creature is when cornered to prove that there are still arapaima out there that are big enough to inflict a deadly blow all i have to do is catch one getting to grips with arapaima in captivity is one thing but getting close to them in the wild is another thing entirely*****************now they are so endangered but there are some people further up this amazon backwater who do have a very ancient relationship with the arapaima and im hoping that when i get there im going to find out an awful lot more ive now been traveling for several days it feels like im light-years from civilization when i finally track down the munduruku people bom dia bom dia although often dressed in western clothes these days the mundurukus still retain their connection to wildlife and to the myths and legends of old it looks like i could be here at the right time a good time is right now when the waters down and the fish are actually concentrated*****************but lunch is on the go and this far from civilization the creatures of the forest like this tarantula are an everyday part of life that is a monster that is an absolute monster i hook up with manoel one of the villages top fishermen hes gonna take me out to see if we can spot some wild arapaima i want to learn all i can about the behavior and natural haunts of this river monster if im going to give myself the best chance of catching a good-sized arapaima what manoel has just told me is that to fish for arapaima the one thing that you really need is patience and im really really getting a sense of*****************just drifting slowly slowly watching for that one sign of the fish coming up to the surface arapaima are air-breathers an adaptation that allows them to live in the oxygen-depleted lakes that form in the amazons dry season but it is also a vital clue for fishermen every time they break the surface they give away their presence and when theyre actually not afraid or at all spooked you know that could be actually quite a gentle ripple for such a big fish its a small sign but it gives away their location the only problem is that it can be minutes or more between breaths so predicting where theyre going to come up next is not easy so*****************you are all day under the hot sun after this huge fish but you know not only is that down there theres all these other different river monsters in the water im often in large metal-hulled fishing boats so coming down to water level in these tiny canoes makes you feel very exposed and vulnerable im beginning to appreciate that how you see the natural world entirely depends on your perspective weve been paddling around here for a fair old while and hes actually seen pointed out a couple of fish surfacing but to be honest i actually couldnt see anything at all i think ive got quite a way to go until i properly get my eye in*****************we head back to the village my guide tells me about one river monster in particular that they fear its called the cobra-grande the big snake ive heard of this monster before and i thought it was a mythical oversized anaconda but i am told that several people here have actually seen it and that a nearby village had to totally relocate because they were so terrified of the big snake manoel here has actually seen a cobra-grande and it was actually on land so im very keen to get the details of this this sounds to be more than just a big anaconda this was a huge animal immense size great big head and this thing was black*****************cobra-grande very recently this is an opportunity not to be missed i decide to put my arapaima hunt on hold to see if one of the amazons most unbelievable myths is in fact reality ive come to meet the munduruku people to try and catch the amazons biggest fish but as ive become immersed in their world and myths ive decided to put my arapaima hunt on hold to follow up a lead that might reveal another vast river monster the cobra-grande or big snake im on my way up a narrow winding creek in the middle of flooded forest except at the moment the water is very very low and im on my way to see the hole where a cobra-grande is supposed to live this is the giant snake which you know i thought was just purely a creature of myth but they said no no we are*****************it sounds quite ugly theyre somewhat frustrated that it doesnt seem to be here today although there are very very definite signs that something large is around these parts if im to fish for a giant arapaima then i will be entering the home of monsters maybe i wont meet the cobra-grande on this trip but im finally grasping how myth and reality are intertwined for these people im sure i could spend a lifetime learning more and more about the arapaima and the creatures that share its mysterious world but its now time to put all i have gathered into practice this is actually a place where the tribespeople around here used to come before a big battle to focus the mind prepare themselves mentally beforehand and um i guess as im likely to need all the help that i can get you know its not a bad idea*****************me to just spend a few minutes here as well i know that if im going to be successful i need to understand and respect a fish that for the local tribes is the incarnation of a warrior mentally and physically prepared its game on its just me my guide johnny and out there somewhere a very big fish im putting into practice the things ive learnt not just from the fish in captivity but also the whole business about locating the fish spotting them patience you know gradually working close so that youre in a position of getting one on the line with the water so low in this lake oxygen levels are depleted the arapaimas air-breathing physiology*****************both its strength and its weakness it came into existence millions of years before there were hunters like me around scanning the waters surface for that telltale clue im told there is another small lake in the forest where modern line fishing is allowed for arapaima as long as its catch and release we cant take the canoe there but we can go on foot and the fact that its tucked away a little bit you know maybe theres gonna be something that i can get a bait out over there yes yes yes yes thats a fish ive heard tales of various amazon monsters on this journey some legendary some real and all dangerous but theres one creature*****************despite overfishing id love to prove really grows to mythic proportions its the arapaima a fish capable of knocking a man from his canoe and leaving him for dead but the only way i know how to prove these monsters are still out there is to catch one and ive heard of a lake that might be just the place to do that this lake looks really nice actually its very quiet lots of snags which could be interesting im actually using a thing called a circle hook now that looks like its just not gonna hook anything at all the point just coming in here thats just not gonna hook on anything but in fact if thats the*****************mouth what happens is it just comes and turns and there it is right in the corner of the mouth oh there we go that was one i just saw this red tail come up fraction of a second but i recognize it now that was an arapaima and what ive got to do is try and quietly get into position so i can actually put a bait near that fish one thing that i learned from the tribespeople which is actually quite hard to do but ive just got to be patient yes yes yes yes ah yeah thats a fish thats a good fish oh hes up i can see the fish as the battle with this*****************approaches the half-hour mark im reminded that the rebellious proud spirit that inhabits this fish even refused to surrender to the gods right its got to be out there we go oh look at that it came out so easily okay were ready there it is look at that for a fish look at that massive female arapaima about pounds i finally have the proof in my arms that huge arapaima are still out here this is a true dinosaur of the deep i need this fish to regain its strength after our battle before i release it if i put it straight back it might not have the energy to swim to the surface to take a breath*****************being an air-breather it would drown just the head a little bit under the water and pointing up towards the bank so that if it does thrash theres only one way it can go in theory which is not back into the water although they can just double round degrees even at the end of a long fight i can still feel the strength of this fish so i can absolutely imagine this thing being able to oh there we go thats good thats good thats good bom that was the fish just having a breath which is excellent it means the fish is not too tired out but i mean mainly this fish is just a bony head*****************a big cylinder of muscle behind it if this fish wasnt tired out i dont think id be able to hold it thats good no its gone we were just wondering if it had enough strength to go and no doubt about it i just couldnt hold it and in fact at the end of an epic battle on the line but also an epic quest trying to find one of these things but you know finally feeling the strength of it absolutely im in no doubt now that if you were in a small fishing canoe and that thing hit you underneath it would easily upend the canoe and then if you were in the water afterwards and*****************got on the wrong side of that head my goodness that would absolutely take you out mythic and real beasts swirl around one another here in the amazon when people go missing there is usually talk of giant snakes and man-eating caiman i set out to show that the arapaima is an underestimated fish capable of extraordinary feats of strength if cornered trapped or netted it becomes a formidable opponent an airborne missile i knew i had to overcome my fear to prove my case i went back into the water and caught an ancient survivor that is part fish part legend and entirely worthy of a deadly reputation now this is a real river monster,the wels catfish or silurus glanis also called sheatfish or just wels is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central southern and eastern europe in the basins of the baltic black and caspian seas it has been introduced to western europe as a prized sport fish and is now found from the united kingdom east to kazakhstan and china and south to greece and turkey etymology the english common name comes from wels the common name of the species in german language wels is a variation of old high german wal from proto-germanic hwalaz the same source as for whale from proto-indo-european skwalos sheatfish evolution the earliest known fossil remains of the wels catfish are from the late miocene about million years ago of ukraine potentially slightly older but less well-preserved remains from 6-7 million years ago are also known from the same region during this*****************period the dominant catfish in eastern europe appears to have been the modern soldatovs catfish s soldatovi now only found in eastern asia which was better adapted to the warmer climate the wels catfish may have been restricted to a single refugium in the ponto-caspian region around this point during the pliocene the wels catfish appears to have expanded its range and gradually supplanted soldatovs catfish up to the latters extirpation from the region during the late pliocene it is thought that the more adaptable wels catfish was more tolerant to the cooling and drying trend over this period and the increased seasonality caused by it description the wels catfishs mouth contains lines of numerous small teeth two long*****************on the upper jaw and four shorter barbels on the lower jaw it has a long anal fin that extends to the caudal fin and a small sharp dorsal fin relatively far forward the wels relies largely on hearing and smell for hunting prey owing to its sensitive weberian apparatus and chemoreceptors although like many other catfish the species exhibits a tapetum lucidum providing its eyes with a degree of sensitivity at night when the species is most active with its sharp pectoral fins it creates an eddy to disorient its victim which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole the skin is very slimy skin colour varies with environment clear water will give the fish a*****************color while muddy water will often tend to produce green-brown specimens the underside is always pale yellow to white in colour albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally with an elongated body-shape wels are able to swim backwards like eels the female produces up to eggs per kilogram of body weight the male guards the nest until the brood hatches which depending on water temperature can take from three to ten days if the water level decreases too much or too fast the male has been observed to splash the eggs with its tail in order to keep them wet the wels catfish is a long-lived species with a specimen of years old having been captured*****************a recent study in sweden size the wels is one of the largest freshwater fish in europe and western asia only exceeded by the anadromous atlantic and beluga sturgeon most adult wels catfish are about m ft in ft in long fish longer than m ft in are a rarity at m ft in they can weigh kg lb and at m ft in they can weigh kg lb only under exceptionally good living circumstances can the wels catfish reach lengths of more than about m ft in examples include the record wels catfish of kiebingen near rottenburg germany which was m ft in long and weighed kg lb even larger specimens have been caught in poland m kg*****************czech republic m the dnieper river in ukraine the volga river in russia the ili river in kazakhstan france spain in the ebro italy in the po and arno serbia in gruza lake where a m ft in long specimen weighing kg lb was caught on june and the danube river where a catfish measuring m ft and weighing kg lb was caught at erdap gorge in the same year and greece where this fish was introduced a few decades ago greek wels grow well thanks to the mild climate lack of competition and good food supply the heaviest authenticated specimen captured from the river po by a hungarian fisherman in weighed kg lb although there are recent anecdotal*****************of larger wels exceeding kg lb meanwhile the longest wels on record was an unweighed specimen from the po measuring m ft captured in the maximum total length may possibly exceed m ft with a maximum weight of over kg lb such lengths are rare and unproven during the last century but there is a somewhat credible report from the 19th century of a wels catfish of this size brehms tierleben cites heckls and kners old reports from the danube about specimens m ft long and kg lb in weight and vogts report of a specimen caught in lake biel which was m ft in long and weighed kg lb in k t kessler wrote about specimens from the*****************river which were over m ft long and weighed up to kg lb according to the hungarian naturalist otto hermann 1835-1914 catfish of kilograms were also caught in hungary in the old centuries from the tisza river exceptionally large specimens are rumored to attack humans in rare instances this claim was investigated by extreme angler jeremy wade in an episode of the animal planet television series river monsters following his capture of three fish two of about kg lb and one of kg lb of which two attempted to attack him following their release a report in the austrian newspaper der standard on august mentions a wels catfish dragging a fisherman near gyor hungary under water by his right*****************after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold the man reported he barely escaped from the fish which he estimated to have weighed over kg lb diet like most freshwater bottom feeders the wels catfish lives on annelid worms gastropods insects crustaceans and fish larger specimens have also been observed to eat frogs snakes rats voles coypu and aquatic birds such as ducks even cannibalising on other catfish researchers at the university of toulouse france in documented individuals of this species in an introduced environment lunging out of the water to feed on pigeons at water edge of the beaching behaviour observed and filmed in this study were successful in bird capture stable isotope analyses of catfish*****************contents using carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 revealed a highly variable dietary composition of terrestrial birds this is likely the result of adapting their behaviour to forage on novel prey in response to new environments upon its introduction to the river tarn in since this type of behaviour has not been reported within the native range of this species they can also eat red worms in the fall but only the river species the wels catfish has also been observed taking advantage of large die-offs of asian clams to feed on the dead clams at the surface of the water during the daytime this opportunistic feeding highlights the adaptability of the wels catfish to new food sources since the species is*****************a nocturnal bottom-feeder distribution and ecology the wels catfish lives in large warm lakes and deep slow-flowing rivers it prefers to remain in sheltered locations such as holes in the riverbed sunken trees etc it consumes its food in the open water or in the deep where it can be recognized by its large mouth wels catfish are kept in fish ponds as food fish an unusual habitat for the species exists inside the chernobyl exclusion zone where a small population lives in abandoned cooling ponds and channels at a close distance to the decommissioned power plant these catfish appear healthy and are maintaining a position as top predators in the aquatic ecosystem of the immediate area as introduced*****************there are concerns about the ecological impact of introducing the wels catfish to regions where it is not native following the introduction of wels catfish populations of other fish species have undergone steep declines since its introduction in the mequinenza reservoir in it has spread to other parts of the ebro basin including its tributaries especially the segre river some endemic species of iberian barbels genus barbus in the cyprinidae that were once abundant especially in the ebro river have disappeared due to competition with and predation by wels catfish the ecology of the river has also changed with a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae the wels catfish may have established a population in santa catarina*****************they were imported from hungary in and were washed into the itajai-acu river after a flood caused their tanks to overflow in a specimen weighing kg lbs and m ft long was captured in blumenau suggesting the catfish have survived and possibly be reproducing conservation status although silurus glanis is not considered globally endangered the conservation status varies across the species native distribution range in the northern periphery of the distribution the species has been declining over the last centuries and was extinct from denmark in the 1700s and from finland in the 1800s in sweden it persists only in a few lakes and rivers and is now considered as near threatened recent genetic studies have furthermore found that*****************swedish populations harbors low genetic diversity and are genetically isolated and differentiated from each other highlighting the need for conservation attention as food only when younger is the wels generally valued as food the flesh is more palatable when the fish weighs less than kg lb larger than this size the fish is highly fatty and additionally can be loaded with toxic contaminants through bioaccumulation due to its position at the top of the food chain large specimens are not recommended for consumption but are sought out as sport fish due to their combativeness a common lure for wels catfish is a clonk which when dropped in the water produces a distinct sound that induces them to bite attacks*****************people tabloids regularly report attacks caused by various catfish that primarily affected animals often only the role of the catfish was presumed in april an austrian fisherman was allegedly attacked by a catfish in one of the fishing lakes in per near gyor hungary however the man reportedly managed to break free the wels was the subject of an episode in the first season of the documentary television show river monsters host jeremy wade concluded that wels catfish in the area were not large enough to consume adult human beings but could easily swallow a child wade documented instances of wels catfish being aggressive towards humans including a wels he had just caught that doubled round and attempted to*****************his calf similar stories occur in the works of older natural history writers alfred brehm a german naturalist published his famous work the world of animals in the 19th century it was also translated into hungarian at the beginning of the 20th century in this brehm or the compiling hungarian scientists write the following old gesners conrad gessner swiss naturalist claim that catfish doesnt spare humans either doesnt just belong in the realm of tales as we know of several cases that confirm that thus heckel and kner mention that a catfish was caught at bratislava in the stomach of which the remains of a child corpse were found fishermen credible to antipa probably romanian zoologist grigore antipa told*****************that children bathing in the stomachs of catfish were caught in the bones of their hands and feet - communicates vutskits probably hungarian zoologist huvutskits gyorgy - a romanian fisherman penetrated the middle of the danube with his boat because he wanted to take a bath while bathing a catfish caught his legs which he could no longer pull out of the mouth of this big-mouthed monster and so he got to the bottom of the water a few days later they came across the corpse of a dead fisherman whose legs were still in the catfishs mouth but even the greedy robber could not release his victims legs and drowned because of it in june a wels was*****************at by a police officer after it had bitten five people in the brombachsee in northern bavaria the incident attracted media attention and sparked outrage on social media according to the police trying to kill the fish was necessary

amazon assassins,arapaima,arapaima gigas,the amazon river is known for containing an evil collection of murderous beasts but theres one family of fish living here that could write a serial killers handbook their methods are so bloodthirsty and varied i can see from here the way they are just literally drilling their way into that fish members of the catfish family have reportedly swallowed people whole theyve eaten them alive from within and even gruesomely penetrated individuals in the most intimate of places im jeremy wade fish on biologist and extreme angler and im on the hunt for these killer catfish to determine if this family are the amazons ultimate river monsters now imagine that in an orifice in the heart of the brazilian amazon a truck makes a solemn path towards the local police station it carries a macabre load the corpse of a man but the circumstances of his death were bizarre in the extreme fearing accusations of murder the fishermen have taken the corpse to the police station in the exact state in which they found it just a pair of legs protruding from the mouth of a vast catfish could this wild tale emerging from the amazon really be true or is this just a made-up fishermans tale and no more real than this photo re-creation of what it might have looked like ive faced many of the largest and most feared creatures in the waterways of this world and ive discovered that you dont need to swim in the sea to encounter a man-eater rivers harbor just as many monsters ask people what is the most feared fish in the amazon and theyll undoubtedly say piranha electric eel or even stingray but ive come to brazil to find out if catfish are actually the worst of the lot a true mafia-style family of killers at large and ive tracked down sil val mir one of the witnesses to this bizarre murder to hear his story basically theres a little bit of a frenzy of fishing activity going on one of the nets got stuck on a rock and in that situation the only thing you can do if youre not gonna rip the net youve got to go down and get it off so this one fisherman dived in to free the net however what happened was that he didnt come up the net came up no fish in it no fisherman nothing more was seen until about four hours later when suddenly this huge fish appeared on the surface and it was thrashing around because the fish was actually itself in trouble actually choking the fisherman was actually half inside the mouth of the fish just the legs of the fisherman sticking out and what happened then was that the fishermen all went to try and get the fish to net it and he said because it was obviously quite tired it was quite easy just one net they got it in and clubbed it to death they left his body inside the fish and then went to manaus as fast as possible obviously you know get it to the police station to make sure that theres no suspicion that it was a case of murder or anything like that the murderer was identified as a piraiba the largest species of catfish found here in the amazon so that fish could have been about pounds i mean we are talking some seriously seriously big fish here the mouth about centimeters across thats a couple of foot across but he says it opens up more so maybe foot this was a pretty monstrous fish and a pretty horrific end for that particular fisherman he says there are people disappearing all the time and you never find a trace of them you know you dont find the body you dont find bones you dont find anything even having heard this horrific story from an eyewitness someone who was actually there seeing this monstrous fish with the fishermans feet just poking out of the mouth i still find it really hard to believe that there are fish here capable of doing that and what i want to do is actually see my own eyes how big the fish are in these amazon rivers i think the first thing ive got to do is go back to where this story all started and actually go myself to the scene of the crime val mir talked of seeing a 500-pound piraiba which seems extreme but photos do exist of some pretty large catfish there are three species of giant catfish found here in the amazon the jau the red-tailed catfish and the piraiba this catch was reported to be nearly foot long and some pounds but maybe as val mir suggests there are even bigger monsters out there and if i follow his leads perhaps ill get to catch a man-eater of my own after traveling for hours i reach my destination a river junction up a tributary of the amazon as far as i can gather this is the scene of the crime and whats interesting is this is a very obvious meeting of the waters you can see it so clearly because the two rivers that meet here are different colors one is muddy white water one is black water according to the locals large catfish wait in ambush at river junctions like this to predate on smaller fish traveling downriver because im after a pretty monstrous fish im using monstrous tackle ive got a huge forged-steel hook on the end attached to a length of wire and then ive got about yards of very strong line okay and this rod youd normally only see this on a boat out in the open ocean the kind of thing youd use to catch marlin tuna that kind of thing but im using this stuff in freshwater people only think of predatory fish living in the sea but here i am about miles from the ocean staking out a crime scene to catch a man-eater something down there just grabbed the bait bent the rod and then let go thats a fish on thats a fish on its taking line taking line taking feels pretty sizable well be a little decisive and brutal now the fish doesnt want to know that doesnt want to know going down the fish is coming up in the water up in the water there it is its a jau its a good size this fish is not the piraiba i was hoping for but the jau is a catfish and some fishermen claim it can be just as dangerous as the larger piraiba but its not finished it doesnt like the size of the boat at all it has a reputation for being so strong on the end of a line that some people will tell you that it has dragged fishermen down into the depths this is about pounds pounds its a good-sized fish the hook hold looks good might even be able to land it on land after minutes of hard struggle i have the better of it and my goodness feeling the strength of this thing i wouldnt want that round my ankle or i wouldnt want to be headfirst down the mouth of something like that either there we go it looks a really sinister fish that dark black color and it gets that from it gets that from living down in the lightless zone deep in the rocky pools where it just blends in with the background and particularly looking at it from here just the shape of it you know its a great big mouth large head very muscular midriff and then just tapering off into this very chunky powerful propulsion unit just looking at these long whiskers that they use to probe their surroundings its pretty obvious where catfish get their name so this is a real you know this is a fish thats adapted for strong water very strong fish and if one of those was to grab you theres not a great deal you could do about it time to release this animal so the scene of the crime may not have yielded the man-eating piraiba i was after but this impressive jau shows that there are some large catfish down there oh wanting to go already wanting to go already thats good thats good there it goes ooh quite a fish if i can get a big catfish here at this minor river junction then perhaps if i fish the largest river junction in the world the meeting of the waters near manaus ill land the mother of all catfish im on a mission to hook the largest catfish in the amazon the piraiba cause i want to prove that the stories about them swallowing fishermen are more than just fishermens tales and after catching a large jau at a river junction i think i know just the place to catch a monster this is it this is the meeting of the waters this is the black water the rio negro coming down here mixing with the white muddy water of the rio solimoes and together they form the mighty amazon and this has to be probably the biggest river junction in the world and everybody says that the big catfish they love river junctions so this place has to be a good bet for the mother of all catfish the point where these two rivers meet is more than a mile wide over feet deep in places and for almost another four miles these two massive waterways refuse to merge due to their different speeds temperatures and sediment contents julio cavalcanche has caught a 211-pound piraiba at the meeting of the waters but on another occasion he nearly died here when the line wrapped around his body and started to pull him out of the boat he had to cut himself free with this very knife julio credits his fishing success to a secret bait formula that he wraps around a hook seals in a tin can and leaves to bake in the sun for three days ooh oh dear ugh i think most of the fish in this river are gonna know that stuff is in there look here right that mmm that just looks so ugh ive never seen anything quite like that right the fish like it the fish like it this is the guts the by-products of eight chickens so the entire intestines of one chicken is about that long wound round and youve got eight entire intestinal tracts of chickens to make up that bait i think with this now i have to be ready to go fishing julio reckons that once the sun sets and night falls the catfish come out to feed thats the bait on a huge hook lump of lead to keep it down ill feed this over the side ive got foot of iron cable feels good the monsters could be on the move hows this for float fishing ive got a barrel on here i mean this is a jaws moment if ever there was one the baits out the engines cut its now just a case of being quiet and just drifting down with the current but being out here after dark also increases the risks here youve not only got a very very powerful fish that might hang on the end of the line youve also got to keep an eye out for the weather and also this is a very very busy waterway theres gonna be boats big barges all sorts of stuff and theyll just run you over if you give them a chance if you dont get out of the way and foot below all that is my bait the water underneath me could be feet deep but the piraiba whose name means mother of all the fishes is totally at home here with a lightning-conducting rod in my hands im easily the highest point in this wide stretch of river so i decide to call it a day before that storm gets any closer ah well nothing nothing came for that bait and i dont know maybe i cant blame them either its just not my night or the fact that it is so close to a big city means that the fish have all been fished out there is a huge fishing fleet operating from manaus and this is right on the doorstep perhaps you know i need to go further away from civilization if im to get the mother of all the catfish i head into the dark heart of the amazon up a distant tributary of the main river to see if that tactic changes my luck maybe here ill catch my man-eating piraiba head down head down head down head down head down argh fish on could this be the river monster im after but wholl win this battle me or the fish i asked what is the worst thing that has ever happened to me on a fishing trip the answer is all three i survived a plane crash unscathed in the amazon i caught malaria and nearly died in the congo and i was arrested and interrogated as a suspected spy on the thailaos border im here in the amazon investigating a family of killer catfish its taking line its a strong fish this and i think ive hooked a piraiba come round gonna come round gonna come round the largest catfish species found here this is a good-sized fish i havent seen it yet look at that that is actually not the fish i want that is a huge red-tailed catfish i want the white streamlined sharklike piraiba but this thing my goodness this is a good size this is a very good size oh now that this fish is in the boat it is pumping air not water over its gills creating these strange sounds that is a big old catfish and its getting me in training for the piraiba the only thing is too many more experiences like this one and i just wont have any energy for a fish thats bigger than this and i mean this thing is just a huge head huge bony head tapering off into this leathery body and a great big wide mouth there without any teeth as such but its got real good grasping pads unlike a shark that can bite its prey in half catfish have to swallow it whole so if they are overly ambitious they will choke but this fish has a different problem inside its mouth is a parasitic bloodsucker another one here and that is absolutely engorged absolutely engorged with blood the blood of this poor catfish this tiny parasite the candiru and this vast predator are both from the mafia-like family of catfish this is pretty disgusting i dont know if i can get hold of it cause theyre very slippery need more fingernails okay there we go so there we go before and after this ones fed this ones still lean and hungry and as ill find out its these small guys you have to watch out for as this parasite is one of the cruelest catfish ill meet there we go okay that was nice to catch that not the fish i want but you know thats a real monster in its own right the candiru usually targets a big fish as its host drinking blood from its gills but occasionally they make mistakes this has resulted in one of the most infamous legends ever to emerge from the amazon a man urinating in the river who has a fish swim up his penis yet for one gentleman this urban myth became reality luckily he was able to make it to this surgery in manaus where he was treated by dr anoar samad hed actually had this fish inside him for four days and the reason there was such a delay was because he actually lived a long way in the interior away from the city he had a very very swollen bladder he was bleeding general fever swollen testicles generally in a very bad way the fish wasnt visible its got these little sort of spines on the gill flaps so it was almost like working its way in like that it would have swum as far as the sphincter at which point the fish was apparently trying to sort of gnaw its way out it was actually instead of just swimming up the urethra it was actually starting to gnaw so this guy obviously was in a lot of pain what was done first of all was that the endoscope was put in the end of his penis into the urethra the endoscope was equipped with a camera and this is the actual footage from that operation they were expecting to find a little fish what they found instead was something that went almost from the entrance of the urethra all the way back to the sphincter theyre talking about something five or six inches so not exactly a little fish quite a substantial animal candiru locate their hosts by following the trail of dilute urea that fish excrete from their gills this could explain this candirus mistake i go in search of its unfortunate victim to re-introduce him to the actual fish that swam up his urine stream having heard a horrific account of a fish entering a mans penis i managed not only to track down the victim but i take him back to the actual scene of the assault on his manhood to relive the events that have haunted him since that day okay so its years ago its in this very spot silvio and some friends were in the water down there and after a little period of time silvio felt the need to urinate as happens he knew the story about the candiru so he actually took himself partially out of the water while he was relieving himself suddenly he said he just had a bit of a shock and the first thing he knew was that the fish was already you know inside only just the end of its tail was out tried to grab hold of it but its a very smooth fish a bit like a bar of soap no good no success pulling it out so basically just ran up onto the bank to try and get some help i decide to throw a net out to see if i can catch one of these critters here we go this is almost exactly what silvio described you know something going in one direction and just not wanting to come into reverse at all look at that i can actually feel its spines digging in when it does that it was actually walking using its head now imagine that in an orifice this fish is just leaking blood its not this fishs blood its something its been feeding on and it is just an absolute nightmare a real sort of vampire fish this thing a fish like this may have entered silvio in search of a blood meal but little did it know that its mistake would result in an unprecedented medical procedure lasting two hours the first thought was to a bit like a hook thats got a barb on it actually pulling it back the way it went in is not always a good idea he was thinking of actually sort of coming in from the side coming in from the perineum and actually trying to sort of pull the fish out headfirst but he thought because it had been such a long time in there they would actually and also the fish was starting to rot a bit maybe try and pull it out with the endoscope you know out tailfirst the way that it went in the tail of the fish was about here about an inch in and so the head of it would have been somewhere like here and then what happened was that the pincers were gradually manipulated out of the hole here there we go grabbed hold of the fish just in front of the tail and then using the camera and then the whole apparatus just gradually gradually very delicately moved out apparently it was necessary to pull with a certain amount of force but feeling that its not doing any damage and fortunately it did come out eventually the fish was sent to the national institute of amazonian research to be formally identified thus confirming after centuries of speculation that a fish has entered a human in the most intimate of places this is a somewhat momentous and possibly delicate occasion im bringing silvio back to meet his fish this one silvio this is actually the first time since he had the surgery that silvio has seen this fish this very fish i just asked silvio if he would like to handle it and a very definite no i think once was enough so maybe if i leave it in my hand but im quite struck by how large it is now hes looking at it now thinking i didnt realize it was that big i thought it was smaller it really does sort of beggar belief that something of that size could burrow into you so is the candiru the worst of all the fish in the amazon a catfish of such vile reputation that none can surpass it dr lucia rapp the curator of the collection here wants to show me another catfish species that is potentially even more horrific than the bloodsucking candiru so what was the case that you heard about we had a situation here recently we received a visit of a doctor he came with some images of two corpses two men he believed that they were shot because they have those very round holes on the body he started to dissect the corpse and he saw it was not gunshots the corpses were hollow already inside without any organs wow im just trying to imagine being a pathologist and youre brought a corpse theres what looks like bullet holes you start to dissect the body and the body is hollow the organs have been removed and there wasnt any kind of bullet or something inside the corpses just the fishes so he realized that the fishes got inside the bodies and eaten the organs inside the fish was identified as a close catfish relative of the bloodsucking candiru called the candiru-acu would they have been dead when the fish got in well they suspected the men might be eaten alive because he saw the structure of the flesh and they were eaten from the inside and they probably died from that not gonna be alive for very long with all that going on inside you yeah thats for sure if you are alive if you feel the fish you can just remove it but if you are for example drunk or ill or something you may not have enough strength to resist them imagine a whole bunch of these fish attacking you at once not a very pleasant thought if youre going for a little swim in the amazon having heard this gruesome tale i decide to visit the city morgue to see if i can track down any more details i think its all very well having a certain scientific curiosity about some of these bizarre and gruesome deaths but actually seeing the people waiting outside here who have come basically to identify bodies you know it becomes much more personal and im not to be honest totally prepared for what im gonna sort of hear or even see in there a little bit sort of uneasy and uncomfortable about it but yeah time to go anyway ive come to the manaus morgue to investigate an incident where a human was eaten from within by a catfish dr elizabeth bezerra has dealt with several cases like this she was the first pathologist to recognize this bizarre behavior and present it to the outside world apparently mondays are the worst days for bodies coming in in this state people go out picnics having a drink on the weekend they fall in the water they disappear and then mondays the bodies come to the surface so i mean it sounds like were not just talking about one or two animals the most that dr elizabeth has actually taken from a corpse or found inside is more than of these fish so these fish are sort of purpose-built for the task it appears cylindrical body very smooth and slimy and then they have this mouth that when it opens it produces a circular bite these are actual photographs from the morgue that show the gunshot-wound-like holes and in some cases the fish still inside the human corpse the body is literally eaten from the inside just the bones and some skin remain so its really quite a horrifying thing to visualize unlike the harmless catfish of the us amazon catfish are proving to be a diverse group of gruesome killers and having heard this grisly story im strangely drawn to this macabre fish im keen to see a live one in action but i dont think ill be using a human corpse as bait the thought of maybe more than of these boring into a human body i mean they really are flesh-eating monsters its not often you use a big fish to catch a small fish but after just two hours its definitely worked oh whoa whoa whoa what was that what was that i dont know the scientific name for all the scavengers at this gruesome picnic the locals call these musun or snakefish theres actually something a bit different in there if i can get it out i dont really want to shove my hand in there there there there there there there there just hold him there we go so this is the candiru-acu this is the fish that bores holes in the body and then devours from the inside out and it was this fish that they retrieved from those corpses in the morgue this was a heavy fish when it went in nothing left inside in fact if i just rip it open a little bit the candiru-acu makes no distinction between human flesh and that of any other animal floating in the amazon just like a hollow case of skin with the remnants of the bone inside this is almost exactly what the autopsy report was in the morgue except in that case we were talking about a human being this water is obviously filled with flesh-eaters so i try and entice them to feed out of my hand im actually just on somebodys house here and im just dangling this fish off the side and these candiru are just attacking right on the surface and i can see from here the way they are just literally drilling their way into that fish its like a crocodile death roll and no doubt the cause of the gunshot-like entry holes in the corpses i might try and lift them out actually look at that hey theres one there back in the water apparently these things will give you a bite just like a piranha look at that thats very very definite cut and this is all the work of the candiru the amazon river is a scavengers paradise its like an acid bath here for corpses and again its members of the catfish family that are one of the principal operators cleaning up the bodies but as i continue my quest i witness an astounding act of cannibalism good grief and finally track down my river monster thats a piraiba its a piraiba ive seen that here in the amazon small catfish have a frightening ability to attack us where it hurts most and also to dispose of our bodies but what about the large catfish i started this quest with a tale of a man-eater can they really swallow something as big as themselves i need to resume my hunt for the biggest catfish in the amazon the piraiba but no sooner have i cast into the water when my fishing guide flavio spots a truly graphic example of overambitious amazon predation oh louco something that immediately reminds me of the man half-swallowed by a fish weve just seen this payara floating down the river quite a big one still alive we thought it was dead to start with on investigation its got another one down its throat and flavios just grabbing hold of the tail of it and pulling it out here we go look at it its the tail of another fish so this fish almost choked to death on something just too big to swallow really if we can get the other fish out it might survive but as it is good grief size of that look at that just look at that good grief look at the size of the fish that that other fish swallowed so thats the meal the one thats looking slightly worse for wear and this is the greedy one that swallowed it which might now recover this remarkable act of cannibalism is just as ambitious as the catfish that tried to swallow a man maybe in these murky waters accidentally biting off more than you can chew is a common occurrence oh louco reinvigorated by this chance encounter im back on my quest in earnest oh just trying a different spot here got a rapid at the top there and then theres a deep hole with a clean bottom and this is a particular place for piraiba ive had a few fish recently that have taken the bait and i just havent hooked up or theyve come off come on oh its come off so im trying something a little bit clever im putting a double-hooked rig on so that the idea is it doesnt have to take the entire bait even if it just nips the tail of it or the body of it i should hook up get a good hook hold okay off the front of the boat something down there just grabbed the bait bent the rod then let go ugh that is a fish on i think its coming towards me what i dont want is the hook to come out like it has been doing feels strange there are people who hook these fish and theyre literally on for hours and it gets dark and they give up and cut the line ive come far too far to give up so even though my muscles are aching i carry on it has a very fast sort of pulsing to it its not a throb throb throb throb this is a big fish i can only bully to a certain extent strong strong strong fish strong fish strong fish after a struggle of nearly half an hour i have the better of it there it is theres the fish theres the fish theres the fish piraiba its a piraiba ah here we go this is the one i wanted this is the piraiba the real monster of the amazon the fish is growling at me oh big old mouth on there heavy heavy fish i can hardly hold this up my arms are pretty shot anyway i can feel the fish flexing its about to kick whoa oops and this is the one that people say when it gets big enough it goes after people as well looks a bit like a shark and it has a reputation to match this is a big one but they do go bigger they do go bigger this one i dont know possibly about pounds this is a man-sized fish but they go bigger than man-sized they go a size big enough to swallow a man and a streamlined fish smooth skin no scales but its a very streamlined catfish most catfish are pretty slobby they mope around on muddy bottoms but this is a fish of fairly fast current and i can just feel that muscle flexing thats a lovely lovely result and am i tired am i tired what ive got to do though is remember that the fish is as tired as i am so although i want to admire it out of the water ive got to get it back and think of the think of the fishs recovery as well oh oh okay okay okay oh and hes gone what a river monster in my investigation ive seen how in these murky waters catfish sometimes make mistakes ive seen how catfish make no distinction between human and other flesh and ive seen firsthand how in the amazon fish will bite off more than they can chew so if you combine these findings and imagine this piraiba three times the size still well within the maximum recorded weight then just ask yourself are those accounts of fish swallowing people just fishermens tales i came here in search of a man-eating fish but instead i found a mafia-like family of killers that are surely the amazons most frightening river monsters,arapaima gigas also known simply as arapaima pirarucu or paiche is a species of arapaima native to the basin of the amazon river once believed to be the sole species in the genus it is among the largest freshwater fish the species is an obligate air breather so it needs to come to the surface regularly to breathe air taxonomy arapaima gigas was originally regarded as the only species in the genus arapaima monotypic but the subsequent identification of further species together with the rarity of specimens and the loss of several type specimens has led to some uncertainty regarding classification within the genus and the identity of described individuals recently some studies have added extra species to the genus due to common morphological features including arapaima leptosoma and arapaima agassizii these speciation events may have occurred due to evidence of long-distance marine or geodispersal from similar morphological traits in both fossilized and living specimen within the genus overall it is unclear if arapaima gigas truly is the only species in its genus description the species is among the largest known freshwater fish commonly measuring cm in and reportedly exceptionally reaching lengths of up to cm ft adults may weigh up to kg lb of the total body weight head weight is typically to it is an ancient fish belonging to a group of primitive carnivorous bony-tongued fishes a gigas has a streamlined body with dorsal and anal fins set well back towards the tail while the body is mainly gray to gray-green its brazilian local name pirarucu derives from an indigenous word for red fish thought to refer to either the red flecks on the scales towards the tail or the reddish-orange color of its meat red coloration typically shows up in males after sexual maturation with up to of the total body plan in males having red coloration the fish have flexible armor-like scales made up of a hard mineralized outer layer and a tough-but-flexible inner layer that help protect it from attacks by piranhas the scales which are typically 57cm but can reach 10cm in larger individuals are built from collagen fibers in a layered structure on the body they overlap each other to form the armor-like characteristic distribution and history a gigas is native to freshwater in the basin of the amazon river and tocantins-araguaia brazil river basins it is known to occur in brazil and peru in bolivia and peru known as paiche it is considered an invasive species in most parts affecting local native species and the ecosystem other small populations have been found in the iquitos region of peru and four distinct rivers in ecuador colombia and guyana its populations are increasing and becoming more common in its non-native range yet is rapidly declining in its native range it was first found in introduced into the madre de dios region in peru for aquaculture in about a decade arapaimas were found in bolivian waters due to the connection of the madre de dios basin to the beni river in bolivia rising water of aquaculture ponds allowed fish to escape into the watershed and establishing populations outside of containment current distribution in bolivia is characterized by registered distribution points including small rivers lagoons and streams between the beni and madre de dios peru rivers historical reports of arapaima sightings started north near the border of peru then traveled downstream as populations began to establish and spatially separate in less than years the species has invaded the madre de dios and beni watersheds the species has been introduced to parts of east asia both for fishing purposes and accidentally the fish are found in flooded forest areas where they reproduce during the wet season they relocate to lakes after water levels drop it is also distributed by ornamental aquaculture and commonly pet-traded in europe north america south america and asia there are fish farms in thailand and malaysia it is particularly prominent in java and sumatra regions in indonesia studies found some single individuals in freshwater or dead in shallow water one finding recorded a total of individuals in surabaya which is the second largest indonesian city a 13-million-year-old fossil of arapaima or very similar species has been found in colombia in the villavieja formation which dates from the miocene epoch physiology average lifespan in captivity is years there is no sufficient evidence on lifespan in the wild a gigas grows rapidly reaching about 10kg in its first year then at moderate growth rates once reaching sexual maturity around years of age or m length morphology changes occur as an individual undergoes the transition from water-breather to air-breather days after hatch during the transition to air-breathing the structure of the gills changes making them better adapted for ion absorption but less able to undergo gas diffusion once developmental changes in the gills take place the lamella is less recognizable the adult gills are made up of smooth column-shaped filaments the kidneys have an important role in nitrogenous waste excretion in this species and are enlarged in adult fish phenotypic sex of a gigas juveniles is not differentiated meaning the gonad cells can produce both sexes in females only the left ovary was developed which differs in size during the reproductive cycle it increases as maturation occurs then reduces after spawning females have a genital pore on their ventral under side that connects the reproductive organs with external environment to allow for mating in males only a left testis was developed which was small and did not differ in size during the reproductive cycle both reproductive organs are unpaired and situated near the swim bladder in some cases right gonads were found but atrophic both males and females have a gland-like secretory organ on the head mostly used for communication with offspring and is therefore more prominent in maleswho provide the majority of parental care the secretion is made of substances and consist of hormones proteins peptides and likely pheromones which also provides nutrients for fry freshly hatched fish ecology breathing a gigas requires breathing surface air to supplement the oxygen it derives from the use of its gills and as such is dependent on surfacing every minutes to loudly gulp air at the surface as in other species in the genus a modified swim bladder that contains lung-like tissue is used for this purpose feeding the species are specialized carnivores feeding primarily on fish invertebrates are also part of their diet juveniles prefer insects and fish larvae until fully grown seasonal growth is observed due food selectivity and strong seasonal changes in food availability they also consume birds mammals fruits and seeds on the water surface prey fish families include callichthyidae loricariidae pimelodidae and heptapteridae migration the species undergoes seasonal lateral migration between river channels and floodplains driven by low depth and low current velocity the lake and forest habitats seem to be preferred when water levels are high a gigas fish migrated to flooded forests with increasingly rising levels when water levels decline fish begin to migrate towards lower levels of flooded forests then to lakes where they stay when it is physically isolated due to low water levels migration to the flooded forest is a mechanism for feeding and parental care with prey for both adults and offspring having increased densities in this habitat at the high-water season during high water levels a gigas populations have high densities in lakes due to increased survival rates physical safety feeding adequate feeding rates and promoting reproduction courtship and mating activities spawning sexual maturity is reached at years and female fecundity increases with each year spawning occurs in lakes and river channels during the time of low water levels august to march in small separate clutches with an average of less than eggs in each batch parents have been observed using their mouths to dig holes in the substrate to create a nest for eggs small batched spawning strategy is thought to derive from the unpredictability of the environment as it lowers the total loss of fertilized eggs due to natural events in the event of reproductive failures pairs may breed again for better success males remain to protect the offspring for three to six months body mass and muscle yield does not differ during sexual maturation cycles unlike many other fish species red pigment among males is thought to be used for sexual selection as it is a proxy for age conservation a gigas genetic diversity has been greatly impacted due to habitat loss environmental degradation and commercial overexploitation in native fish stocks as extreme as causing bottlenecks in some populations in its native ecosystems it helps to cycle nutrients and energy loss of migration paths from anthropogenic actions separates local populations and forms refuges that can persevere but without the exchange of genes the species has in the past been heavily impacted by overfishing exacerbated by their need to surface for breathing every to minutes causing them to be easy to harpoon it is classified under the iucn as data deficient due to a lack of detailed information about population developments in addition arapaima gigas is listed in the cites appendix ii since forcing legal harvest to be monitored under intergovernmental control with a management plan furthermore in it was published in the brazilian list of overexploited or threatened with over exploitation aquatic invertebrates and fishes there are reports that local populations have become extinct in certain areas of brazil and peru aquaculture has further threatened diversity through transportation of specimens over hundreds of kilometers this can cause homogenized genes and in some cases wipe out locally adapted populations a study of genetic diversity of arapaima gigas in the araguaia-tocantins basin estimated by issr marker by vitorino et al found that low heterozygosity existed in populations that underwent bottleneck scenarios which is assumed to be from inbreeding and low reproductive success low heterozygosity can detriment future evolutionary potential of species the study suggests periodic monitoring to check eventual reducing levels of population genetic variability and the establishment of management plan so far no technology exists to manipulate the reproduction of the species arapaima fishing was banned outright in brazil from to due to declining populations since then both subsistence and commercial fishing have been permitted in specially designated areas and a sophisticated sustainable management strategy has led to massive recovery of stocks from in to over in however there are still large markets of illegal arapaima fishing in the lower amazon with about of its harvest coming from unlawful practices furthermore local community-based initiatives have been established to protect waterways for natural reproduction and reestablishment of populations invasion arapaima gigas follows what is coined as the biodiversity conservation paradox where a species has become endangered in its native habitat yet becoming growingly invasive in nonnative home ranges previously discussed in the distribution section of this page aquaculture for both fish meat and ornamental markets has caused the spread of the fish where it has become invasive and threaten the integrity of ecosystems in some parts of brazil juvenile individuals are captured and bred in captivity then dispersed and exported by traders for aquaculture profit south america for bolivia the arapaima as an invasive species is considered a threat to local native species according to reports various reports show a correlation between the spreading of arapaima and the decline in numbers of native fish species in parts of the bolivian amazon effects on local fish species populations and on fishing behaviors vary strongly by region a joint study of the bolivian government and different research organizations from points out the necessity to further evaluate the complex environmental and socioeconomic impact of arapaima in the country oftentimes introduction comes from accidentally escaped aquaculture groups or for purposeful control of undesirable prey in parts of brazil and south-eastern peru as discussed in the distribution section once established in the madre de dios region in peru populations moved to bolivian waters through connections through the beni river watershed the beni river has few natural barriers theoretically allowing the arapaima populations to continue evading further south and terrorizing native fishes in bolivia and even western brazil indonesia as an invasive species in indonesia there are subsequent consequences that can be followed in the future as populations are not yet established enough to significantly affect native species however it can be assumed that risks would be similar to events observed in bolivia and brazil such as decrease in native populations and fishing stock some fishermen even say that these large bony-tongued fish damage their nets therefore causing socio-economic losses one study specifically focused on a gigas in indonesia found no fry or juveniles in the wild but one female was found with eggs this with the finding of climate matching causes the inability to rule out successful reproduction and establishment in the region for now it is suggested to understand the reproduction and ecology in introduced arapaimas in indonesia in order to properly propose management strategies and fishingtrading sanctions cultural importance arapaima gigas are exploited for fish meat markets and ornamental fishing which can include production as it has been noted that the characteristic armored scales are commonly used as nail files in areas around the amazon basin fishing and aquaculture provides many jobs in the region in addition to the fish being an important traditional food for local communities references classification names common names synonyms catalog of fishes genus species

unknown,30054,5612,19803,3096,the amazon river is known for containing an evil collection of murderous beasts but theres one family of fish living here that could write a serial killers handbook their methods are so bloodthirsty and varied i can see from here the way they are just literally drilling their way into that fish members of the catfish family have reportedly swallowed people whole theyve eaten them alive from within and even gruesomely penetrated individuals in the most intimate of places im jeremy wade fish on biologist and extreme angler and im on the hunt for these killer catfish to determine if this family are the amazons ultimate river monsters now imagine that in an orifice in the heart of the brazilian amazon a truck makes a solemn path towards the local police station it carries a macabre load the corpse of a man but the circumstances of his death were bizarre*****************the extreme fearing accusations of murder the fishermen have taken the corpse to the police station in the exact state in which they found it just a pair of legs protruding from the mouth of a vast catfish could this wild tale emerging from the amazon really be true or is this just a made-up fishermans tale and no more real than this photo re-creation of what it might have looked like ive faced many of the largest and most feared creatures in the waterways of this world and ive discovered that you dont need to swim in the sea to encounter a man-eater rivers harbor just as many monsters ask people what is the most feared fish in*****************amazon and theyll undoubtedly say piranha electric eel or even stingray but ive come to brazil to find out if catfish are actually the worst of the lot a true mafia-style family of killers at large and ive tracked down sil val mir one of the witnesses to this bizarre murder to hear his story basically theres a little bit of a frenzy of fishing activity going on one of the nets got stuck on a rock and in that situation the only thing you can do if youre not gonna rip the net youve got to go down and get it off so this one fisherman dived in to free the net however what happened was that he*****************come up the net came up no fish in it no fisherman nothing more was seen until about four hours later when suddenly this huge fish appeared on the surface and it was thrashing around because the fish was actually itself in trouble actually choking the fisherman was actually half inside the mouth of the fish just the legs of the fisherman sticking out and what happened then was that the fishermen all went to try and get the fish to net it and he said because it was obviously quite tired it was quite easy just one net they got it in and clubbed it to death they left his body inside the fish and then went to*****************as fast as possible obviously you know get it to the police station to make sure that theres no suspicion that it was a case of murder or anything like that the murderer was identified as a piraiba the largest species of catfish found here in the amazon so that fish could have been about pounds i mean we are talking some seriously seriously big fish here the mouth about centimeters across thats a couple of foot across but he says it opens up more so maybe foot this was a pretty monstrous fish and a pretty horrific end for that particular fisherman he says there are people disappearing all the time and you never find a trace of*****************you know you dont find the body you dont find bones you dont find anything even having heard this horrific story from an eyewitness someone who was actually there seeing this monstrous fish with the fishermans feet just poking out of the mouth i still find it really hard to believe that there are fish here capable of doing that and what i want to do is actually see my own eyes how big the fish are in these amazon rivers i think the first thing ive got to do is go back to where this story all started and actually go myself to the scene of the crime val mir talked of seeing a 500-pound piraiba which seems*****************but photos do exist of some pretty large catfish there are three species of giant catfish found here in the amazon the jau the red-tailed catfish and the piraiba this catch was reported to be nearly foot long and some pounds but maybe as val mir suggests there are even bigger monsters out there and if i follow his leads perhaps ill get to catch a man-eater of my own after traveling for hours i reach my destination a river junction up a tributary of the amazon as far as i can gather this is the scene of the crime and whats interesting is this is a very obvious meeting of the waters you can see it so clearly*****************the two rivers that meet here are different colors one is muddy white water one is black water according to the locals large catfish wait in ambush at river junctions like this to predate on smaller fish traveling downriver because im after a pretty monstrous fish im using monstrous tackle ive got a huge forged-steel hook on the end attached to a length of wire and then ive got about yards of very strong line okay and this rod youd normally only see this on a boat out in the open ocean the kind of thing youd use to catch marlin tuna that kind of thing but im using this stuff in freshwater people only think of predatory fish*****************in the sea but here i am about miles from the ocean staking out a crime scene to catch a man-eater something down there just grabbed the bait bent the rod and then let go thats a fish on thats a fish on its taking line taking line taking feels pretty sizable well be a little decisive and brutal now the fish doesnt want to know that doesnt want to know going down the fish is coming up in the water up in the water there it is its a jau its a good size this fish is not the piraiba i was hoping for but the jau is a catfish and some fishermen claim it can be just*****************dangerous as the larger piraiba but its not finished it doesnt like the size of the boat at all it has a reputation for being so strong on the end of a line that some people will tell you that it has dragged fishermen down into the depths this is about pounds pounds its a good-sized fish the hook hold looks good might even be able to land it on land after minutes of hard struggle i have the better of it and my goodness feeling the strength of this thing i wouldnt want that round my ankle or i wouldnt want to be headfirst down the mouth of something like that either there we go it looks a*****************sinister fish that dark black color and it gets that from it gets that from living down in the lightless zone deep in the rocky pools where it just blends in with the background and particularly looking at it from here just the shape of it you know its a great big mouth large head very muscular midriff and then just tapering off into this very chunky powerful propulsion unit just looking at these long whiskers that they use to probe their surroundings its pretty obvious where catfish get their name so this is a real you know this is a fish thats adapted for strong water very strong fish and if one of those was to grab you*****************not a great deal you could do about it time to release this animal so the scene of the crime may not have yielded the man-eating piraiba i was after but this impressive jau shows that there are some large catfish down there oh wanting to go already wanting to go already thats good thats good there it goes ooh quite a fish if i can get a big catfish here at this minor river junction then perhaps if i fish the largest river junction in the world the meeting of the waters near manaus ill land the mother of all catfish im on a mission to hook the largest catfish in the amazon the piraiba cause i want*****************prove that the stories about them swallowing fishermen are more than just fishermens tales and after catching a large jau at a river junction i think i know just the place to catch a monster this is it this is the meeting of the waters this is the black water the rio negro coming down here mixing with the white muddy water of the rio solimoes and together they form the mighty amazon and this has to be probably the biggest river junction in the world and everybody says that the big catfish they love river junctions so this place has to be a good bet for the mother of all catfish the point where these two rivers meet*****************more than a mile wide over feet deep in places and for almost another four miles these two massive waterways refuse to merge due to their different speeds temperatures and sediment contents julio cavalcanche has caught a 211-pound piraiba at the meeting of the waters but on another occasion he nearly died here when the line wrapped around his body and started to pull him out of the boat he had to cut himself free with this very knife julio credits his fishing success to a secret bait formula that he wraps around a hook seals in a tin can and leaves to bake in the sun for three days ooh oh dear ugh i think most of the*****************in this river are gonna know that stuff is in there look here right that mmm that just looks so ugh ive never seen anything quite like that right the fish like it the fish like it this is the guts the by-products of eight chickens so the entire intestines of one chicken is about that long wound round and youve got eight entire intestinal tracts of chickens to make up that bait i think with this now i have to be ready to go fishing julio reckons that once the sun sets and night falls the catfish come out to feed thats the bait on a huge hook lump of lead to keep it down ill feed this*****************the side ive got foot of iron cable feels good the monsters could be on the move hows this for float fishing ive got a barrel on here i mean this is a jaws moment if ever there was one the baits out the engines cut its now just a case of being quiet and just drifting down with the current but being out here after dark also increases the risks here youve not only got a very very powerful fish that might hang on the end of the line youve also got to keep an eye out for the weather and also this is a very very busy waterway theres gonna be boats big barges all sorts of*****************and theyll just run you over if you give them a chance if you dont get out of the way and foot below all that is my bait the water underneath me could be feet deep but the piraiba whose name means mother of all the fishes is totally at home here with a lightning-conducting rod in my hands im easily the highest point in this wide stretch of river so i decide to call it a day before that storm gets any closer ah well nothing nothing came for that bait and i dont know maybe i cant blame them either its just not my night or the fact that it is so close to a big city*****************that the fish have all been fished out there is a huge fishing fleet operating from manaus and this is right on the doorstep perhaps you know i need to go further away from civilization if im to get the mother of all the catfish i head into the dark heart of the amazon up a distant tributary of the main river to see if that tactic changes my luck maybe here ill catch my man-eating piraiba head down head down head down head down head down argh fish on could this be the river monster im after but wholl win this battle me or the fish i asked what is the worst thing that has ever happened to*****************on a fishing trip the answer is all three i survived a plane crash unscathed in the amazon i caught malaria and nearly died in the congo and i was arrested and interrogated as a suspected spy on the thailaos border im here in the amazon investigating a family of killer catfish its taking line its a strong fish this and i think ive hooked a piraiba come round gonna come round gonna come round the largest catfish species found here this is a good-sized fish i havent seen it yet look at that that is actually not the fish i want that is a huge red-tailed catfish i want the white streamlined sharklike piraiba but this thing my*****************this is a good size this is a very good size oh now that this fish is in the boat it is pumping air not water over its gills creating these strange sounds that is a big old catfish and its getting me in training for the piraiba the only thing is too many more experiences like this one and i just wont have any energy for a fish thats bigger than this and i mean this thing is just a huge head huge bony head tapering off into this leathery body and a great big wide mouth there without any teeth as such but its got real good grasping pads unlike a shark that can bite its prey*****************half catfish have to swallow it whole so if they are overly ambitious they will choke but this fish has a different problem inside its mouth is a parasitic bloodsucker another one here and that is absolutely engorged absolutely engorged with blood the blood of this poor catfish this tiny parasite the candiru and this vast predator are both from the mafia-like family of catfish this is pretty disgusting i dont know if i can get hold of it cause theyre very slippery need more fingernails okay there we go so there we go before and after this ones fed this ones still lean and hungry and as ill find out its these small guys you have to watch*****************for as this parasite is one of the cruelest catfish ill meet there we go okay that was nice to catch that not the fish i want but you know thats a real monster in its own right the candiru usually targets a big fish as its host drinking blood from its gills but occasionally they make mistakes this has resulted in one of the most infamous legends ever to emerge from the amazon a man urinating in the river who has a fish swim up his penis yet for one gentleman this urban myth became reality luckily he was able to make it to this surgery in manaus where he was treated by dr anoar samad hed actually*****************this fish inside him for four days and the reason there was such a delay was because he actually lived a long way in the interior away from the city he had a very very swollen bladder he was bleeding general fever swollen testicles generally in a very bad way the fish wasnt visible its got these little sort of spines on the gill flaps so it was almost like working its way in like that it would have swum as far as the sphincter at which point the fish was apparently trying to sort of gnaw its way out it was actually instead of just swimming up the urethra it was actually starting to gnaw so this guy*****************was in a lot of pain what was done first of all was that the endoscope was put in the end of his penis into the urethra the endoscope was equipped with a camera and this is the actual footage from that operation they were expecting to find a little fish what they found instead was something that went almost from the entrance of the urethra all the way back to the sphincter theyre talking about something five or six inches so not exactly a little fish quite a substantial animal candiru locate their hosts by following the trail of dilute urea that fish excrete from their gills this could explain this candirus mistake i go in search of*****************unfortunate victim to re-introduce him to the actual fish that swam up his urine stream having heard a horrific account of a fish entering a mans penis i managed not only to track down the victim but i take him back to the actual scene of the assault on his manhood to relive the events that have haunted him since that day okay so its years ago its in this very spot silvio and some friends were in the water down there and after a little period of time silvio felt the need to urinate as happens he knew the story about the candiru so he actually took himself partially out of the water while he was relieving himself*****************he said he just had a bit of a shock and the first thing he knew was that the fish was already you know inside only just the end of its tail was out tried to grab hold of it but its a very smooth fish a bit like a bar of soap no good no success pulling it out so basically just ran up onto the bank to try and get some help i decide to throw a net out to see if i can catch one of these critters here we go this is almost exactly what silvio described you know something going in one direction and just not wanting to come into reverse at all look*****************that i can actually feel its spines digging in when it does that it was actually walking using its head now imagine that in an orifice this fish is just leaking blood its not this fishs blood its something its been feeding on and it is just an absolute nightmare a real sort of vampire fish this thing a fish like this may have entered silvio in search of a blood meal but little did it know that its mistake would result in an unprecedented medical procedure lasting two hours the first thought was to a bit like a hook thats got a barb on it actually pulling it back the way it went in is not always a*****************idea he was thinking of actually sort of coming in from the side coming in from the perineum and actually trying to sort of pull the fish out headfirst but he thought because it had been such a long time in there they would actually and also the fish was starting to rot a bit maybe try and pull it out with the endoscope you know out tailfirst the way that it went in the tail of the fish was about here about an inch in and so the head of it would have been somewhere like here and then what happened was that the pincers were gradually manipulated out of the hole here there we go grabbed hold*****************the fish just in front of the tail and then using the camera and then the whole apparatus just gradually gradually very delicately moved out apparently it was necessary to pull with a certain amount of force but feeling that its not doing any damage and fortunately it did come out eventually the fish was sent to the national institute of amazonian research to be formally identified thus confirming after centuries of speculation that a fish has entered a human in the most intimate of places this is a somewhat momentous and possibly delicate occasion im bringing silvio back to meet his fish this one silvio this is actually the first time since he had the surgery that silvio*****************seen this fish this very fish i just asked silvio if he would like to handle it and a very definite no i think once was enough so maybe if i leave it in my hand but im quite struck by how large it is now hes looking at it now thinking i didnt realize it was that big i thought it was smaller it really does sort of beggar belief that something of that size could burrow into you so is the candiru the worst of all the fish in the amazon a catfish of such vile reputation that none can surpass it dr lucia rapp the curator of the collection here wants to show me another catfish*****************that is potentially even more horrific than the bloodsucking candiru so what was the case that you heard about we had a situation here recently we received a visit of a doctor he came with some images of two corpses two men he believed that they were shot because they have those very round holes on the body he started to dissect the corpse and he saw it was not gunshots the corpses were hollow already inside without any organs wow im just trying to imagine being a pathologist and youre brought a corpse theres what looks like bullet holes you start to dissect the body and the body is hollow the organs have been removed and there wasnt*****************kind of bullet or something inside the corpses just the fishes so he realized that the fishes got inside the bodies and eaten the organs inside the fish was identified as a close catfish relative of the bloodsucking candiru called the candiru-acu would they have been dead when the fish got in well they suspected the men might be eaten alive because he saw the structure of the flesh and they were eaten from the inside and they probably died from that not gonna be alive for very long with all that going on inside you yeah thats for sure if you are alive if you feel the fish you can just remove it but if you are for*****************drunk or ill or something you may not have enough strength to resist them imagine a whole bunch of these fish attacking you at once not a very pleasant thought if youre going for a little swim in the amazon having heard this gruesome tale i decide to visit the city morgue to see if i can track down any more details i think its all very well having a certain scientific curiosity about some of these bizarre and gruesome deaths but actually seeing the people waiting outside here who have come basically to identify bodies you know it becomes much more personal and im not to be honest totally prepared for what im gonna sort of hear or*****************see in there a little bit sort of uneasy and uncomfortable about it but yeah time to go anyway ive come to the manaus morgue to investigate an incident where a human was eaten from within by a catfish dr elizabeth bezerra has dealt with several cases like this she was the first pathologist to recognize this bizarre behavior and present it to the outside world apparently mondays are the worst days for bodies coming in in this state people go out picnics having a drink on the weekend they fall in the water they disappear and then mondays the bodies come to the surface so i mean it sounds like were not just talking about one or two*****************the most that dr elizabeth has actually taken from a corpse or found inside is more than of these fish so these fish are sort of purpose-built for the task it appears cylindrical body very smooth and slimy and then they have this mouth that when it opens it produces a circular bite these are actual photographs from the morgue that show the gunshot-wound-like holes and in some cases the fish still inside the human corpse the body is literally eaten from the inside just the bones and some skin remain so its really quite a horrifying thing to visualize unlike the harmless catfish of the us amazon catfish are proving to be a diverse group of gruesome killers*****************having heard this grisly story im strangely drawn to this macabre fish im keen to see a live one in action but i dont think ill be using a human corpse as bait the thought of maybe more than of these boring into a human body i mean they really are flesh-eating monsters its not often you use a big fish to catch a small fish but after just two hours its definitely worked oh whoa whoa whoa what was that what was that i dont know the scientific name for all the scavengers at this gruesome picnic the locals call these musun or snakefish theres actually something a bit different in there if i can get it out*****************dont really want to shove my hand in there there there there there there there there just hold him there we go so this is the candiru-acu this is the fish that bores holes in the body and then devours from the inside out and it was this fish that they retrieved from those corpses in the morgue this was a heavy fish when it went in nothing left inside in fact if i just rip it open a little bit the candiru-acu makes no distinction between human flesh and that of any other animal floating in the amazon just like a hollow case of skin with the remnants of the bone inside this is almost exactly what the*****************report was in the morgue except in that case we were talking about a human being this water is obviously filled with flesh-eaters so i try and entice them to feed out of my hand im actually just on somebodys house here and im just dangling this fish off the side and these candiru are just attacking right on the surface and i can see from here the way they are just literally drilling their way into that fish its like a crocodile death roll and no doubt the cause of the gunshot-like entry holes in the corpses i might try and lift them out actually look at that hey theres one there back in the water apparently these*****************will give you a bite just like a piranha look at that thats very very definite cut and this is all the work of the candiru the amazon river is a scavengers paradise its like an acid bath here for corpses and again its members of the catfish family that are one of the principal operators cleaning up the bodies but as i continue my quest i witness an astounding act of cannibalism good grief and finally track down my river monster thats a piraiba its a piraiba ive seen that here in the amazon small catfish have a frightening ability to attack us where it hurts most and also to dispose of our bodies but what about the*****************catfish i started this quest with a tale of a man-eater can they really swallow something as big as themselves i need to resume my hunt for the biggest catfish in the amazon the piraiba but no sooner have i cast into the water when my fishing guide flavio spots a truly graphic example of overambitious amazon predation oh louco something that immediately reminds me of the man half-swallowed by a fish weve just seen this payara floating down the river quite a big one still alive we thought it was dead to start with on investigation its got another one down its throat and flavios just grabbing hold of the tail of it and pulling it out here*****************go look at it its the tail of another fish so this fish almost choked to death on something just too big to swallow really if we can get the other fish out it might survive but as it is good grief size of that look at that just look at that good grief look at the size of the fish that that other fish swallowed so thats the meal the one thats looking slightly worse for wear and this is the greedy one that swallowed it which might now recover this remarkable act of cannibalism is just as ambitious as the catfish that tried to swallow a man maybe in these murky waters accidentally biting off more than*****************can chew is a common occurrence oh louco reinvigorated by this chance encounter im back on my quest in earnest oh just trying a different spot here got a rapid at the top there and then theres a deep hole with a clean bottom and this is a particular place for piraiba ive had a few fish recently that have taken the bait and i just havent hooked up or theyve come off come on oh its come off so im trying something a little bit clever im putting a double-hooked rig on so that the idea is it doesnt have to take the entire bait even if it just nips the tail of it or the body of*****************i should hook up get a good hook hold okay off the front of the boat something down there just grabbed the bait bent the rod then let go ugh that is a fish on i think its coming towards me what i dont want is the hook to come out like it has been doing feels strange there are people who hook these fish and theyre literally on for hours and it gets dark and they give up and cut the line ive come far too far to give up so even though my muscles are aching i carry on it has a very fast sort of pulsing to it its not a throb throb throb throb this*****************a big fish i can only bully to a certain extent strong strong strong fish strong fish strong fish after a struggle of nearly half an hour i have the better of it there it is theres the fish theres the fish theres the fish piraiba its a piraiba ah here we go this is the one i wanted this is the piraiba the real monster of the amazon the fish is growling at me oh big old mouth on there heavy heavy fish i can hardly hold this up my arms are pretty shot anyway i can feel the fish flexing its about to kick whoa oops and this is the one that people say when it gets*****************enough it goes after people as well looks a bit like a shark and it has a reputation to match this is a big one but they do go bigger they do go bigger this one i dont know possibly about pounds this is a man-sized fish but they go bigger than man-sized they go a size big enough to swallow a man and a streamlined fish smooth skin no scales but its a very streamlined catfish most catfish are pretty slobby they mope around on muddy bottoms but this is a fish of fairly fast current and i can just feel that muscle flexing thats a lovely lovely result and am i tired am i tired what ive*****************to do though is remember that the fish is as tired as i am so although i want to admire it out of the water ive got to get it back and think of the think of the fishs recovery as well oh oh okay okay okay oh and hes gone what a river monster in my investigation ive seen how in these murky waters catfish sometimes make mistakes ive seen how catfish make no distinction between human and other flesh and ive seen firsthand how in the amazon fish will bite off more than they can chew so if you combine these findings and imagine this piraiba three times the size still well within the maximum recorded weight*****************just ask yourself are those accounts of fish swallowing people just fishermens tales i came here in search of a man-eating fish but instead i found a mafia-like family of killers that are surely the amazons most frightening river monsters,arapaima gigas also known simply as arapaima pirarucu or paiche is a species of arapaima native to the basin of the amazon river once believed to be the sole species in the genus it is among the largest freshwater fish the species is an obligate air breather so it needs to come to the surface regularly to breathe air taxonomy arapaima gigas was originally regarded as the only species in the genus arapaima monotypic but the subsequent identification of further species together with the rarity of specimens and the loss of several type specimens has led to some uncertainty regarding classification within the genus and the identity of described individuals recently some studies have added extra species to the genus due to common morphological features including arapaima leptosoma and arapaima agassizii these speciation events may have occurred due to evidence of long-distance marine or geodispersal from similar morphological traits in*****************fossilized and living specimen within the genus overall it is unclear if arapaima gigas truly is the only species in its genus description the species is among the largest known freshwater fish commonly measuring cm in and reportedly exceptionally reaching lengths of up to cm ft adults may weigh up to kg lb of the total body weight head weight is typically to it is an ancient fish belonging to a group of primitive carnivorous bony-tongued fishes a gigas has a streamlined body with dorsal and anal fins set well back towards the tail while the body is mainly gray to gray-green its brazilian local name pirarucu derives from an indigenous word for red fish thought to refer to*****************the red flecks on the scales towards the tail or the reddish-orange color of its meat red coloration typically shows up in males after sexual maturation with up to of the total body plan in males having red coloration the fish have flexible armor-like scales made up of a hard mineralized outer layer and a tough-but-flexible inner layer that help protect it from attacks by piranhas the scales which are typically 57cm but can reach 10cm in larger individuals are built from collagen fibers in a layered structure on the body they overlap each other to form the armor-like characteristic distribution and history a gigas is native to freshwater in the basin of the amazon river and tocantins-araguaia brazil*****************basins it is known to occur in brazil and peru in bolivia and peru known as paiche it is considered an invasive species in most parts affecting local native species and the ecosystem other small populations have been found in the iquitos region of peru and four distinct rivers in ecuador colombia and guyana its populations are increasing and becoming more common in its non-native range yet is rapidly declining in its native range it was first found in introduced into the madre de dios region in peru for aquaculture in about a decade arapaimas were found in bolivian waters due to the connection of the madre de dios basin to the beni river in bolivia rising water of*****************ponds allowed fish to escape into the watershed and establishing populations outside of containment current distribution in bolivia is characterized by registered distribution points including small rivers lagoons and streams between the beni and madre de dios peru rivers historical reports of arapaima sightings started north near the border of peru then traveled downstream as populations began to establish and spatially separate in less than years the species has invaded the madre de dios and beni watersheds the species has been introduced to parts of east asia both for fishing purposes and accidentally the fish are found in flooded forest areas where they reproduce during the wet season they relocate to lakes after water levels drop it is also*****************by ornamental aquaculture and commonly pet-traded in europe north america south america and asia there are fish farms in thailand and malaysia it is particularly prominent in java and sumatra regions in indonesia studies found some single individuals in freshwater or dead in shallow water one finding recorded a total of individuals in surabaya which is the second largest indonesian city a 13-million-year-old fossil of arapaima or very similar species has been found in colombia in the villavieja formation which dates from the miocene epoch physiology average lifespan in captivity is years there is no sufficient evidence on lifespan in the wild a gigas grows rapidly reaching about 10kg in its first year then at moderate growth rates once*****************sexual maturity around years of age or m length morphology changes occur as an individual undergoes the transition from water-breather to air-breather days after hatch during the transition to air-breathing the structure of the gills changes making them better adapted for ion absorption but less able to undergo gas diffusion once developmental changes in the gills take place the lamella is less recognizable the adult gills are made up of smooth column-shaped filaments the kidneys have an important role in nitrogenous waste excretion in this species and are enlarged in adult fish phenotypic sex of a gigas juveniles is not differentiated meaning the gonad cells can produce both sexes in females only the left ovary was developed which differs*****************size during the reproductive cycle it increases as maturation occurs then reduces after spawning females have a genital pore on their ventral under side that connects the reproductive organs with external environment to allow for mating in males only a left testis was developed which was small and did not differ in size during the reproductive cycle both reproductive organs are unpaired and situated near the swim bladder in some cases right gonads were found but atrophic both males and females have a gland-like secretory organ on the head mostly used for communication with offspring and is therefore more prominent in maleswho provide the majority of parental care the secretion is made of substances and consist of hormones proteins*****************and likely pheromones which also provides nutrients for fry freshly hatched fish ecology breathing a gigas requires breathing surface air to supplement the oxygen it derives from the use of its gills and as such is dependent on surfacing every minutes to loudly gulp air at the surface as in other species in the genus a modified swim bladder that contains lung-like tissue is used for this purpose feeding the species are specialized carnivores feeding primarily on fish invertebrates are also part of their diet juveniles prefer insects and fish larvae until fully grown seasonal growth is observed due food selectivity and strong seasonal changes in food availability they also consume birds mammals fruits and seeds on the water*****************prey fish families include callichthyidae loricariidae pimelodidae and heptapteridae migration the species undergoes seasonal lateral migration between river channels and floodplains driven by low depth and low current velocity the lake and forest habitats seem to be preferred when water levels are high a gigas fish migrated to flooded forests with increasingly rising levels when water levels decline fish begin to migrate towards lower levels of flooded forests then to lakes where they stay when it is physically isolated due to low water levels migration to the flooded forest is a mechanism for feeding and parental care with prey for both adults and offspring having increased densities in this habitat at the high-water season during high water levels a*****************batched spawning strategy is thought to derive from the unpredictability of the environment as it lowers the total loss of fertilized eggs due to natural events in the event of reproductive failures pairs may breed again for better success males remain to protect the offspring for three to six months body mass and muscle yield does not differ during sexual maturation cycles unlike many other fish species red pigment among males is thought to be used for sexual selection as it is a proxy for age conservation a gigas genetic diversity has been greatly impacted due to habitat loss environmental degradation and commercial overexploitation in native fish stocks as extreme as causing bottlenecks in some populations in its native ecosystems it helps to cycle nutrients and energy loss of migration paths from anthropogenic actions separates local populations and forms refuges that can persevere but without the exchange of genes the*****************has in the past been heavily impacted by overfishing exacerbated by their need to surface for breathing every to minutes causing them to be easy to harpoon it is classified under the iucn as data deficient due to a lack of detailed information about population developments in addition arapaima gigas is listed in the cites appendix ii since forcing legal harvest to be monitored under intergovernmental control with a management plan furthermore in it was published in the brazilian list of overexploited or threatened with over exploitation aquatic invertebrates and fishes there are reports that local populations have become extinct in certain areas of brazil and peru aquaculture has further threatened diversity through transportation of specimens over hundreds of*****************this can cause homogenized genes and in some cases wipe out locally adapted populations a study of genetic diversity of arapaima gigas in the araguaia-tocantins basin estimated by issr marker by vitorino et al found that low heterozygosity existed in populations that underwent bottleneck scenarios which is assumed to be from inbreeding and low reproductive success low heterozygosity can detriment future evolutionary potential of species the study suggests periodic monitoring to check eventual reducing levels of population genetic variability and the establishment of management plan so far no technology exists to manipulate the reproduction of the species arapaima fishing was banned outright in brazil from to due to declining populations since then both subsistence and commercial fishing have been*****************in specially designated areas and a sophisticated sustainable management strategy has led to massive recovery of stocks from in to over in however there are still large markets of illegal arapaima fishing in the lower amazon with about of its harvest coming from unlawful practices furthermore local community-based initiatives have been established to protect waterways for natural reproduction and reestablishment of populations invasion arapaima gigas follows what is coined as the biodiversity conservation paradox where a species has become endangered in its native habitat yet becoming growingly invasive in nonnative home ranges previously discussed in the distribution section of this page aquaculture for both fish meat and ornamental markets has caused the spread of the fish where it has*****************invasive and threaten the integrity of ecosystems in some parts of brazil juvenile individuals are captured and bred in captivity then dispersed and exported by traders for aquaculture profit south america for bolivia the arapaima as an invasive species is considered a threat to local native species according to reports various reports show a correlation between the spreading of arapaima and the decline in numbers of native fish species in parts of the bolivian amazon effects on local fish species populations and on fishing behaviors vary strongly by region a joint study of the bolivian government and different research organizations from points out the necessity to further evaluate the complex environmental and socioeconomic impact of arapaima in the country*****************introduction comes from accidentally escaped aquaculture groups or for purposeful control of undesirable prey in parts of brazil and south-eastern peru as discussed in the distribution section once established in the madre de dios region in peru populations moved to bolivian waters through connections through the beni river watershed the beni river has few natural barriers theoretically allowing the arapaima populations to continue evading further south and terrorizing native fishes in bolivia and even western brazil indonesia as an invasive species in indonesia there are subsequent consequences that can be followed in the future as populations are not yet established enough to significantly affect native

amazon flesh eaters,payara,hydrolycus scomberoides,no fish inspires the same terror as the shark youre in the monsters mouth getting thrown around somebodys like a rag doll in its mouth getting thrown all over weve got sharks in australia that hit hard they dont leave anything but at least these killers are confined to the oceans or are they it seems one species of shark has been trespassing from saltwater into my territory freshwater operating where people thought no danger existed alan as an angler and biologist my aim is to work out how this is possible and just how far inland these sharks will bring their reign of terror my mission is to find out whether its safe to get back in the water even if youre miles from the sea im a specialist in hunting down giant freshwater animals using a combination of logic local intelligence and intuition i face shoals of piranha in south america and man-eating catfish in asia sharks though are a different target altogether these creatures are the stuff of legend jaws the iconic 70s story describes ferocious man-eaters with a taste for human flesh but the report of a shark operating in an inland lake is truly terrifying to investigate im heading to australia midsummer on a brackish lake the temperature over degrees a 23-year-old post-doctorate student beau martin and his friend david are planning a cooling swim in miami lake im gonna flog you im gonna absolutely slay you in this place put some money where it is bucks bucks done yeah you need it you need that for the race yeah going down gonna beat you whoa hey keys keys keys need keys lets go shirts off less drag were going were going they begin a swimming race across the 500-yard-wide lake dave takes the lead and reaches the safety of the shore beau however is still out on the lake in trying to catch up he strays into deeper water aah in an instant he disappears dave returns to the water but theres no sign of his friend beaus sudden disappearance had all the hallmarks of a shark attack but few could imagine this apparently safe backwater to be a hunting ground for sharks even here where there are the deadliest snakes massive crocs the most poisonous spiders this incident rang alarm bells we just dont expect to be attacked by a shark on an inland lake in an urbanized area like the gold coast in australia there are three species of shark commonly responsible for attacks on people the great white the tiger shark and the bull shark australians know vic hislop as the shark man like quint from jaws hislop has fought a series of battles with sharks including this 12-ton great white weve got sharks in australia that hit and hit hard they dont leave anything theyre so good at what they do they pull somebody under you dont see any more someones got to be looking at that exact spot to see it happen the great white is a notorious man-eater but some experts think the bull shark is a far more deadly threat altogether its a very robust animal very rough and tough because of the structure of its teeth it cant just bite through a big chunk of meat it has to bite and start shaking like crazy and of course somebodys like a rag doll in its mouth getting thrown all over and that immediately also instigates all sorts of fear reactions you know youre in the monsters mouth getting thrown around stocky in shape savage in character the bull shark is built like a street fighter with a level of raging aggression that gives it its name pound for pound its top of the league of man-eaters statistically a bull sharks attack is more likely to result in death than a great whites and the authorities believe that its a bull shark that killed beau martin in this canal system this complex of waterways was built during the 70s and 80s and is bigger than venice italy miles of canals and over lakes this is an area with just thousands of apartments houses right down on the waterfront and most of the people here just think of these canals as a perfectly safe place to swim what puzzles me is how any shark could have made its way here so far from where we expect to find it the open ocean to work that out im heading miles south to the coast there were shark attacks in australia in but theres one well-reported in the press that is central to my investigation 16-year-old brock curtis-mathew is setting off with his friend peter edmonds for some early-morning bodyboarding we got there maybe a quarter to 800-ish theyve chosen a location next to the mouth of the richmond river this is a popular surfing spot often used by these close friends but this morning after several days of heavy rain they have the beach to themselves we were maybe like halfway to where we were gonna go in the water i turned around and came back in and he kept going while brock covers their possessions in case of more rain peter heads out hes around yards from the surf line but as brock goes to rejoin his friend he glimpses a dark shape i saw this big round weird circle thing what brock had seen was a shark he has no idea it is attacking his friend all he can see from yards away is some splashing i was just thinking oh whats he doing somethings somethings not right brock approaches as quickly as he can when i got up like really close i couldnt see any blood and then like once i grabbed him and stuff i noticed his leg risking his own life brock carries his now unconscious friend toward shore he had taken a first-aid course at school there was a slight pulse when i first checked it like a beat beat beat come on pete in a state of shock he calls the emergency services emergency service please hes gonna die i just said can you come down here quickly my friends been attacked by a shark from the shape and the size of the wound to peters thigh the attacker appears to be a bull shark some feet long after the attack lifeguard stephen leahy was one of the first on the scene it was obvious that it was high-impact it was hard-hitting and there was just a large amount of flesh removed from his upper thigh leahy has worked to save lives on these beaches for over years but in this case tragically peter had lost too much blood there was just absolutely nothing that we were going to do that would save this boys life dr vic peddemors is the first person medical teams turn to when they believe theres been a shark attack its estimated that a shark bite applies a force of over tons per square inch the most important thing for a shark is to get that lower jaw in because those are the hooking teeth that sort of latches in so once its got its lower jaw in the upper jaw can clamp down if that lower jaw has got in properly it only needs one bite and itll take the muscle straight off because of the site of this incident the lifeguard already had this attackers identity in mind knowing that the attacks happened just here we always had in the back of our mind that this was going to be a bull shark incident its likely that the shark had confused peter for its common prey a large fish perhaps even another shark nothing can ever compensate a family or friends for such a cruel loss but if there is anything to be salvaged from this terrible episode it might be in identifying the warning signals that accompany a bull shark attack bull sharks have been observed congregating around river mouths after heavy rain attracted by the supply of freshwater fish being washed out to sea we know that bull sharks will always hang around the river mouth after periods of heavy rain and when there are lots of fish around the beach where the attack occurred is only meters away from the entrance of that river mouth the bull shark that killed peter edmonds had been attracted to this shoreline because of its proximity to freshwater were well and truly aware that theres just so much for the bull shark to live on in our freshwater systems and thats part of the uniqueness of the bull shark can easily cope in saltwater and in our oceans but its just as comfortable in our river systems perhaps this knowledge might prevent others being caught like peter in the wrong place at the wrong time as a biologist i want to better understand the physiology and particular affinity bull sharks have for freshwater i need to catch one i must have fished literally thousands of destinations all over the world but this time i think im out of my depth ive never tried to catch any kind of shark let alone a bull shark miles north of where peter was killed in sight of land i join a fishing charter boat out after sharks with four rods set i know im in with a good chance oh yeah right there we go there we go that is a bull shark hammered quite big mullets couple-of-pound mullets and just took off i think were ready to bring it in the back of the boat actually okay this ones none too happy to see me but after the hooks out it becomes easier to handle its feet long around of the length they can reach boats rolling around a little bit at the moment side on to the tide and rolling a little bit so with something like this mouthful of teeth got to be a wee bit careful the teeth are partially obscured by thick gums but the tips are as sharp as scalpels thats good to actually see one of these animals close up get my hands on one thats what i wanted but what sets this species of shark apart is its extraordinary ability to operate in both salty and fresh water the bull shark is the only species of shark that can do this some scientists speculate that the bull shark is capitalizing on this adaptation to dominate new feeding grounds inland the bull shark is unique because its actually much more capable than other sharks in regulating the amount of salts and urea in its body tissues bull sharks constantly test the salt content of the water with tiny sensors mounted all over the body similar to the way we use our taste buds then a special organ the rectal gland acts like an onoff valve releasing or retaining salt as required its really incredible how capable they are at doing that but its obviously energetically very costly and thats why we tend to find the bigger animals capable of changing very quickly whereas the smaller animals tend to stay within a relatively narrow band of salinity this amazing adaptation gives the bull shark a deadly access-all-areas freedom to roam bringing its violence to our once-peaceful inland waters a predator that can operate in rivers and adjoining lakes all around the world responsible for fatal attacks from australia to south africa from florida to new jersey here in four people were killed and one was severely mutilated in a 10-day spree of attacks this provided the inspiration for the most famous shark story of all jaws but what is so terrifying is that two of these deaths occurred miles up an estuary at matawan creek in a place that everyone thought was safe man-eaters are supposed to be found in untamed places but this unstoppable predator seems to be bringing its savagery into the very heart of our civilized world aah is there nothing in place to stop these deadly predators im here to meet tony ham gday jeremy how you going he manages the shark control program on the gold coast in australia got the bait on board were planning to make an inspection of the shark nets just off the main beach this section of the beach is called main beach on the other side of the spit thats a fairly heavily populated beach in summer youd have anywhere upward of 60000 people between here and surfers paradise and then from surfers down further probably double that number its a big beach just running up with sort of all the hotels and some of the tourist amenities behind that exactly but branching off here are a number of canal estates and large lakes and whats happened is its basically extended the river habitat and so we have bull sharks here pretty constantly right up inland yeah so bull sharks will actually live all the way up and including into freshwater reaches of some rivers so theyre definitely in there and when you get in the water if you get in the water you could only be just a matter of yards away from one i suppose literally feet and you wouldnt know they were there unless you know you actually see it or it bumps into you or actually does have a bite at you around the spit at about yards off the beach the swell has picked up this shark net is pretty much the only line of defense along a 12-mile-long beach the idea is to remove sharks that come in close to the shore but looking at it i can see no reason why bull sharks wouldnt easily go under it or around it and then head on relentlessly into the canals after all the net is only yards long and just feet high some think that these measures are in fact literally worse than useless shark nets in australia are a false sense of security for tourism they kill everything we love out there they kill dolphins turtles dugong but more important the big sharks have learned to feed off those nets theyre now a feeding ground cost millions of taxpayers dollars for a waste of time just a false sense of security its a joke if hislop is correct bull sharks are being lured towards the shore and then inland into the canals and lakes and because inevitably theyll meet more people inland this species has to be a far greater threat than other man-eating sharks which remain out at sea on miami lake the day after beau martins disappearance the search begins led by beaus father exhaustively he combs the perimeter of the lake for two days there is no sign of beau on the morning of the third day after the police have given up the hunt he begins to search from his kayak he happens upon the body of his son part in and part out of the water the only reason his body had surfaced the gases resulting from decomposition causing his body to inflate the autopsy revealed that beau had been struck three times by a bull shark one devastating bite on his left thigh proving fatal this predator had slipped with ease from the sea into the brackish water of miami lake once inside it had been free to go about its business unseen until the killing of beau martin revealed its deadly presence but just how much further inland into freshwater are these predators capable of going miles inland from the ocean trainer alan treadwell is taking his finest trotting horse glen-burns arm for exercise in the river id swum there for eight nine years never a problem its a very popular picnic spot this part of the river is a secluded oasis popular with families as a swimming hole but on this day treadwell has the river to himself for his training program he wants to build up his horses muscle strength without straining its legs glen-burns arm a 6-year-old gelding weighing pounds has won times over a 3-year career with the help of his stable hand alice holden treadwell ties a half-inch rope to the horses halter with it he can control the horse from the bridge as far as treadwell can see from feet up on the bridge everything appears to be going to plan the horse was swimming i had control of the horse but suddenly something startles it the horse looks like its gonna drown then all of a sudden i saw something hanging off the back of him alan as the horse rolled over the color lightened and it went to a white underneath whatever it was whatever this creature is it has the force to hold on to and the power to submerge a 1000-pound horse the horse is in trouble we had a problem ive got to get this horse out of there whatevers wrong if i can get him out of the water i can control it he wont drown if we hadnt have gotten him out i dont believe he would have survived trainer alan treadwell was able to pull his horse to safety if the victim had been a human of the size of his horse there would be no hope of surviving the attack the horse glen-burns arm was treated by a veterinary surgeon who photographed the wound i want to meet up with alan treadwell to find out if this attack can be attributed to a bull shark hello alan gday how are you im well thanks this is the boy is he yeah this is him can i say hello say hello hey so hes not just an ordinary horse is he hes a bit of an athlete bit of an athlete yeah he has been or used to be yeah yeah can we see the wound at all can you show me where it was yeah i can do its healed pretty well yeah thats where it was on the flat there right so looking at him now you wouldnt he looks fine he looks fine but i mean did he recover fully or no i dont think so actually he swells up in the fetlock after a hard run right which virtually makes it impossible to race him so in effect this actually finished his career it has done yes it still seems to be a bit awkward in that one back leg i dont know what happened to it its impossible to say so possibly theres some sort of you know deep muscle damage something yeah it could be thats exactly right yeah although there had been no reports of sharks this high up the brisbane river before alan treadwell believes that what he saw was a shark yet he only glimpsed the white shape for a fraction of a second i want to take a logical approach to discover exactly what happened here my first strategy is to measure the salt content at this stretch of the brisbane river the waters saltiness lessens the further upriver you go ive taken a reading of seawater with this machine and the reading i get is about down the other end of the scale anything less than about is freshwater so the fact that ive just got a reading of less than this is freshwater i know bull sharks can get into freshwater everything points to this being a shark attack except for one thing theres a good reason why i dont think they could be responsible for this particular incident look at this just miles down the river is this man-made barrier that just goes right across the river mount crosby weir is a dam that has been in place for over a hundred years the difference in height between the water on the ocean side and the upriver side is feet now i can understand how something might possibly get up from the sea to here but hows it gonna get over that so what else could it be i think there might be a clue in something alan treadwell told me although on the surface the wound to glen-burns arm has healed underneath the skin there is such profound muscle damage that he can no longer race that is exactly the case with attacks made by another animal entirely the saltwater crocodile when a crocodile bites its victim it deposits bacteria in the wound that cause long-term muscle damage the most distinctive thing about a saltwater croc is that big gnarly head with those big actually blunt but long penetrating teeth saltwater crocodiles will live in freshwater saltwater brackish water mineral water they dont care once a crocodile reaches feet and up youre dealing with an animal that can take down a one-ton water buffalo it seems more likely that the creature which attacked glen-burns arm is not a shark but a crocodile what they prefer is deep dark murky water because they are the masters of camouflage thats how they get their prey they will launch from an invisible position up out of the water grab whatever it is theyre targeting drag it back into the water in the blink of an eye just the kind of water where the attack happened theres one problem with this idea while crocs were once found this far south none have been seen any closer than miles away in the last years i would be surprised that a crocodile who is big enough to take on a horse a would go unnoticed for long periods of time you know way outside of its range and b in that situation would miss you know if its in deep water its a large animal and its going in to really have a go youd be the luckiest horse alive when all avenues seem closed i turn to the least unlikely option in my pursuit of the truth if the attacker wasnt a crocodile it has to be a shark yet i need to be certain if this is the truth it has far-reaching repercussions it would show conclusively that savage bull sharks can and will launch attacks in freshwater it would mean there is no kind of water thats safe from these predators but im looking for proof i want to show scientist vic peddemors the wounds inflicted on this racehorse hes one of the worlds leading experts on shark bites so what do you make of that well id definitely say it looks like a shark bite of some description because of these gaps between the tooth and the way that it seems to have scratched down the hindquarter of the horse that is the bite in more context wow i think this is just a hit with the upper jaw and a slip down can you get any idea from that roughly how big the shark might have been this isnt much of a crescent which suggests that the jaw must have been fairly big assuming that that was the sort of this part of the jaw that hit it like that so the curve is quite gentle the curve is very gentle so if you think of it as hitting like that mm-hmm now if you look at this tooth there that tooth there its a fairly close match thats not too far off a match and this is meters in length or foot its a very similar sort of curvature and it links in with our knowledge of bull sharks we one would expect a bigger bull shark up in a very freshwater component of the river this evidence suggests that the creature that attacked alan treadwells horse is a bull shark over feet long and by hunting through the government archives i know now how these animals managed to get over the weir the brisbane river has flooded repeatedly with one extreme occurrence in the city itself was inundated but so too was the surrounding area including the mount crosby dam it seems that as the flood subsided a colony of bull sharks some growing to over feet long were locked in far upriver and if this can happen here it can happen anywhere that bull sharks roam the danger they present isnt restricted to australia bull sharks have been observed moving up the mississippi river as far as st louis and there has even been an attack reported in lake michigan to fully understand this threat i want to get my hands on one of these big predators in freshwater but to do that i need to learn some specialist techniques from an expert in catching big sharks hello there you terry how you doing terry nice to meet you nice to meet you im ben hello there on march 2007 just here in the river mouth terry hesse caught a 12-foot-long female bull shark estimated to weigh over pounds this all looks like pretty serious stuff yeah well for our rods and reels we use one of these right completely blown away with the idea of using a needing to use that in a river these guys are serious im impressed theyre fishing in this busy working port on the frontier between sea and freshwater one thing im noticing already is the attention to detail theyve got a comprehensive plan to outwit the supersensory capacity of this shark bull sharks like all sharks have tiny pinholes in their snout called the ampullae of lorenzini used for detecting electrical fields theyre so sensitive that they can detect the electrical impulses of a fishs heartbeat sharks with wider heads like the bull shark have more of these pinholes and therefore they can lock onto prey more accurately another one there or to avoid giving off any electrical signals to the shark terry masks all but the metal hook point in plastic and cable-ties this to the eel next terrys making sure he capitalizes on the sharks smell sense by using fresh bait of the sharks brain is devoted to sniffing out prey and by fishing at night were choosing the most likely time for sharks to go hunting its in the dark when the supersensory bull shark has the edge over fish that rely more on vision terry begins the journey across the river mouth to place the baits bull sharks have been reported to ram kayaks taking the paddle splash and rudder movements for the thrashing of a fish in distress terrys okay but in getting these baits set in the dark ive injured my index finger its going to make things difficult im just hoping that this and the disturbance from the busy port doesnt damage my chances pick it up pick it up at am fish on with the tide high the line begins to run were on lets actually put that on no off its all right yep starts slowing down at the moment it just feels like theres a boat on the end theres just a dead weight im just changing the ratio there yeah that yeah thats pulling thats pulling thats pulling it is coming my way and with nearly yards of line taken in whatever it is reaches the shore holy what is it that is huge like something from leagues under the sea it certainly isnt a shark but what on earth is it its not a shark but it is an exceptional fish its just remarkable that is something isnt it ive never seen anything like this in my life before its what they call a queensland grouper this is a monster its not the monster i was after but this is a monster were looking at feet and inches what about the girth yeah its girth is 43 this is a protected marine fish normally found on reefs but theyre known to come into river mouths like this on rare occasions look at that this fish even terry and ben havent seen anything like this anywhere like this size you know so its just an amazing catch and particularly from a river just you know this thing really is a river monster groupers have an extraordinary trick this 250-pound male actually started life as a female when there are too few males in a spawning group a female will switch sex to keep breeding numbers up oh ha time though for this gender bender to head back home to me that just underlines even more than before that you know we just have no idea at all what is down there in our rivers it feels amazing to catch a fish like that but its not what im here for armed with the knowledge ive gained from terry im driving miles upriver from brackish water to freshwater im fishing at night im fishing with the freshest bait so and im putting out two rods here we go look something something had that but it didnt have the hook in its mouth so whatever it was its still out there and im running out of bait now so its annoying finally im in luck ive got a take on the other rod and keep it away from some trees and stuff on the side there yeah its a shark its a shark up we come this is a shark in a river okay this may be a small one but for me this is in some ways more unsettling up onto the grass i already know there are big females in this river catching one like this implies theyre breeding here that body is just solid muscle you just feel it when it decides to flex thats just got so much strength there this one didnt swim all the way from the ocean it was most likely born in brackish water just downstream and while only months old it seems to be thriving in freshwater its a scary thought that this river will be its hunting ground for life another years at long and pounds in weight this one could triple in length and become times heavier im just trying to imagine this thing two or three times the length in this water its quite a frightening prospect in a river a small river anyway this ones going back well ive been able to prove without question that bull sharks are trespassing on my patch in freshwater more than miles up an australian river but critically what ive learned is that they have the capacity for brutal attacks in freshwater almost anywhere there are few limits to where this shark will operate more and more it seems that this freshwater jaws is bringing its savagery into our once-tame backyard along metropolitan canals up quiet rivers and on tranquil lakes the bull shark is looking for its next meal its just a question of who and when,the payara hydrolycus scomberoides is a species of dogtooth tetra this predatory fish is found in the amazon basin in tropical south america it was the first of four species to be described in the genus hydrolycus description the most noticeable feature of h scomberoides is the two long fangs protruding from its lower jaw these are used to impale their prey mostly smaller fish it typically reaches a standard length of about cm ft but can reach up to cm ft in there are reports of far larger individuals up to cm ft in in total length and kg lb oz in weight based on records by igfa but this likely involves confusion with the related h armatus h scomberoides is overall silvery with a dark spot behind the opercle and another at the lower base of the pectoral fin in adults the tail is dusky on the basal half turning paler more transparent towards the tip in the aquarium the payara which is also sold as the saber tooth barracuda vampire fish vampire tetra or saber tusk barracuda is a popular species for large aggressive aquariums it requires a large aquarium and can only be mixed with relatively large species as smaller will be seen as potential prey

sharks though are a different target altogether these creatures are the stuff of legend jaws the iconic 70s story describes ferocious man-eaters with a taste for human flesh but the report of a shark operating in an inland lake is truly terrifying to investigate im heading to australia midsummer on a brackish lake the temperature over degrees a 23-year-old post-doctorate student beau martin and his friend david are planning a cooling swim in miami lake im gonna flog you im gonna absolutely slay you in this place put some money where it is bucks bucks done yeah you need it you need that for the race yeah going down gonna beat you*****************safe backwater to be a hunting ground for sharks even here where there are the deadliest snakes massive crocs the most poisonous spiders this incident rang alarm bells we just dont expect to be attacked by a shark on an inland lake in an urbanized area like the gold coast in australia there are three species of shark commonly responsible for attacks on people the great white the tiger shark and the bull shark australians know vic hislop as the shark man like quint from jaws hislop has fought a series of battles with sharks including this 12-ton great white weve got sharks in australia that hit and hit hard they dont leave anything theyre so good at what they do they pull somebody under you dont see any more someones got to be looking at that exact spot to see it happen the great white is a notorious man-eater*****************of latches in so once its got its lower jaw in the upper jaw can clamp down if that lower jaw has got in properly it only needs one bite and itll take the muscle straight off because of the site of this incident the lifeguard already had this attackers identity in mind knowing that the attacks happened just here we always had in the back of our mind that this was going to be a bull shark incident its likely that the shark had confused peter for its common prey a large fish perhaps even another shark nothing can ever compensate a family or friends for such a cruel loss but if there is anything to be salvaged from this terrible episode it might be in identifying the warning signals that accompany a bull shark attack bull sharks have been observed congregating around river mouths after heavy rain attracted*****************the supply of freshwater fish being washed out to sea we know that bull sharks will always hang around the river mouth after periods of heavy rain and when there are lots of fish around the beach where the attack occurred is only meters away from the entrance of that river mouth the bull shark that killed peter edmonds had been attracted to this shoreline because of its proximity to freshwater were well and truly aware that theres just so much for the bull shark to live on in our freshwater systems and thats part of the uniqueness of the bull shark can easily cope in saltwater and in our oceans but its just as comfortable in our river*****************perhaps this knowledge might prevent others being caught like peter in the wrong place at the wrong time as a biologist i want to better understand the physiology and particular affinity bull sharks have for freshwater i need to catch one i must have fished literally thousands of destinations all over the world but this time i think im out of my depth ive never tried to catch any kind of shark let alone a bull shark miles north of where peter was killed in sight of land i join a fishing charter boat out after sharks with four rods set i know im in with a good chance oh yeah right there we go there we go that*****************a bull shark hammered quite big mullets couple-of-pound mullets and just took off i think were ready to bring it in the back of the boat actually okay this ones none too happy to see me but after the hooks out it becomes easier to handle its feet long around of the length they can reach boats rolling around a little bit at the moment side on to the tide and rolling a little bit so with something like this mouthful of teeth got to be a wee bit careful the teeth are partially obscured by thick gums but the tips are as sharp as scalpels thats good to actually see one of these animals close up get my*****************on one thats what i wanted but what sets this species of shark apart is its extraordinary ability to operate in both salty and fresh water the bull shark is the only species of shark that can do this some scientists speculate that the bull shark is capitalizing on this adaptation to dominate new feeding grounds inland the bull shark is unique because its actually much more capable than other sharks in regulating the amount of salts and urea in its body tissues bull sharks constantly test the salt content of the water with tiny sensors mounted all over the body similar to the way we use our taste buds then a special organ the rectal gland acts like*****************onoff valve releasing or retaining salt as required its really incredible how capable they are at doing that but its obviously energetically very costly and thats why we tend to find the bigger animals capable of changing very quickly whereas the smaller animals tend to stay within a relatively narrow band of salinity this amazing adaptation gives the bull shark a deadly access-all-areas freedom to roam bringing its violence to our once-peaceful inland waters a predator that can operate in rivers and adjoining lakes all around the world responsible for fatal attacks from australia to south africa from florida to new jersey here in four people were killed and one was severely mutilated in a 10-day spree of attacks*****************provided the inspiration for the most famous shark story of all jaws but what is so terrifying is that two of these deaths occurred miles up an estuary at matawan creek in a place that everyone thought was safe man-eaters are supposed to be found in untamed places but this unstoppable predator seems to be bringing its savagery into the very heart of our civilized world aah is there nothing in place to stop these deadly predators im here to meet tony ham gday jeremy how you going he manages the shark control program on the gold coast in australia got the bait on board were planning to make an inspection of the shark nets just off the main*****************part out of the water the only reason his body had surfaced the gases resulting from decomposition causing his body to inflate the autopsy revealed that beau had been struck three times by a bull shark one devastating bite on his left thigh proving fatal this predator had slipped with ease from the sea into the brackish water of miami lake once inside it had been free to go about its business unseen until the killing of beau martin revealed its deadly presence but just how much further inland into freshwater are these predators capable of going miles inland from the ocean trainer alan treadwell is taking his finest trotting horse glen-burns arm for exercise in the river id swum there for eight nine years never a problem its a very popular picnic spot this part of the river is a secluded oasis popular with families as a swimming hole*****************on this day treadwell has the river to himself for his training program he wants to build up his horses muscle strength without straining its legs glen-burns arm a 6-year-old gelding weighing pounds has won times over a 3-year career with the help of his stable hand alice holden treadwell ties a half-inch rope to the horses halter with it he can control the horse from the bridge as far as treadwell can see from feet up on the bridge everything appears to be going to plan the horse was swimming i had control of the horse but suddenly something startles it the horse looks like its gonna drown then all of a sudden i saw something hanging off*****************or used to be yeah yeah can we see the wound at all can you show me where it was yeah i can do its healed pretty well yeah thats where it was on the flat there right so looking at him now you wouldnt he looks fine he looks fine but i mean did he recover fully or no i dont think so actually he swells up in the fetlock after a hard run right which virtually makes it impossible to race him so in effect this actually finished his career it has done yes it still seems to be a bit awkward in that one back leg i dont know what happened to it its impossible to say so possibly theres some sort of you know deep muscle damage something yeah it could be thats exactly right yeah although there had been no reports of sharks this high*****************the brisbane river before alan treadwell believes that what he saw was a shark yet he only glimpsed the white shape for a fraction of a second i want to take a logical approach to discover exactly what happened here my first strategy is to measure the salt content at this stretch of the brisbane river the waters saltiness lessens the further upriver you go ive taken a reading of seawater with this machine and the reading i get is about down the other end of the scale anything less than about is freshwater so the fact that ive just got a reading of less than this is freshwater i know bull sharks can get into freshwater everything points*****************sea to here but hows it gonna get over that so what else could it be i think there might be a clue in something alan treadwell told me although on the surface the wound to glen-burns arm has healed underneath the skin there is such profound muscle damage that he can no longer race that is exactly the case with attacks made by another animal entirely the saltwater crocodile when a crocodile bites its victim it deposits bacteria in the wound that cause long-term muscle damage the most distinctive thing about a saltwater croc is that big gnarly head with those big actually blunt but long penetrating teeth saltwater crocodiles will live in freshwater saltwater brackish water mineral water they dont care once a crocodile reaches feet and up youre dealing with an animal that can take down a one-ton water buffalo it seems more likely that the creature*****************closer than miles away in the last years i would be surprised that a crocodile who is big enough to take on a horse a would go unnoticed for long periods of time you know way outside of its range and b in that situation would miss you know if its in deep water its a large animal and its going in to really have a go youd be the luckiest horse alive when all avenues seem closed i turn to the least unlikely option in my pursuit of the truth if the attacker wasnt a crocodile it has to be a shark yet i need to be certain if this is the truth it has far-reaching repercussions it would show conclusively that savage bull sharks can and will launch attacks in freshwater it would mean there is no kind of water thats safe from these predators but im looking*****************proof i want to show scientist vic peddemors the wounds inflicted on this racehorse hes one of the worlds leading experts on shark bites so what do you make of that well id definitely say it looks like a shark bite of some description because of these gaps between the tooth and the way that it seems to have scratched down the hindquarter of the horse that is the bite in more context wow i think this is just a hit with the upper jaw and a slip down can you get any idea from that roughly how big the shark might have been this isnt much of a crescent which suggests that the jaw must have been fairly*****************present isnt restricted to australia bull sharks have been observed moving up the mississippi river as far as st louis and there has even been an attack reported in lake michigan to fully understand this threat i want to get my hands on one of these big predators in freshwater but to do that i need to learn some specialist techniques from an expert in catching big sharks hello there you terry how you doing terry nice to meet you nice to meet you im ben hello there on march just here in the river mouth terry hesse caught a 12-foot-long female bull shark estimated to weigh over pounds this all looks like pretty serious stuff yeah well for our rods and reels we use one of these right completely blown away with the idea of using a needing to use that in a river these guys are serious im*****************theyre fishing in this busy working port on the frontier between sea and freshwater one thing im noticing already is the attention to detail theyve got a comprehensive plan to outwit the supersensory capacity of this shark bull sharks like all sharks have tiny pinholes in their snout called the ampullae of lorenzini used for detecting electrical fields theyre so sensitive that they can detect the electrical impulses of a fishs heartbeat sharks with wider heads like the bull shark have more of these pinholes and therefore they can lock onto prey more accurately another one there or to avoid giving off any electrical signals to the shark terry masks all but the metal hook point in plastic and*****************this to the eel next terrys making sure he capitalizes on the sharks smell sense by using fresh bait of the sharks brain is devoted to sniffing out prey and by fishing at night were choosing the most likely time for sharks to go hunting its in the dark when the supersensory bull shark has the edge over fish that rely more on vision terry begins the journey across the river mouth to place the baits bull sharks have been reported to ram kayaks taking the paddle splash and rudder movements for the thrashing of a fish in distress terrys okay but in getting these baits set in the dark ive injured my index finger its going to make*****************difficult im just hoping that this and the disturbance from the busy port doesnt damage my chances pick it up pick it up at am fish on with the tide high the line begins to run were on lets actually put that on no off its all right yep starts slowing down at the moment it just feels like theres a boat on the end theres just a dead weight im just changing the ratio there yeah that yeah thats pulling thats pulling thats pulling it is coming my way and with nearly yards of line taken in whatever it is reaches the shore holy what is it that is huge like something from leagues under the sea it*****************isnt a shark but what on earth is it its not a shark but it is an exceptional fish its just remarkable that is something isnt it ive never seen anything like this in my life before its what they call a queensland grouper this is a monster its not the monster i was after but this is a monster were looking at feet and inches what about the girth yeah its girth is this is a protected marine fish normally found on reefs but theyre known to come into river mouths like this on rare occasions look at that this fish even terry and ben havent seen anything like this anywhere like this size you know so its*****************an amazing catch and particularly from a river just you know this thing really is a river monster groupers have an extraordinary trick this 250-pound male actually started life as a female when there are too few males in a spawning group a female will switch sex to keep breeding numbers up oh ha time though for this gender bender to head back home to me that just underlines even more than before that you know we just have no idea at all what is down there in our rivers it feels amazing to catch a fish like that but its not what im here for armed with the knowledge ive gained from terry im driving miles upriver from*****************water to freshwater im fishing at night im fishing with the freshest bait so and im putting out two rods here we go look something something had that but it didnt have the hook in its mouth so whatever it was its still out there and im running out of bait now so its annoying finally im in luck ive got a take on the other rod and keep it away from some trees and stuff on the side there yeah its a shark its a shark up we come this is a shark in a river okay this may be a small one but for me this is in some ways more unsettling up onto the grass i*****************know there are big females in this river catching one like this implies theyre breeding here that body is just solid muscle you just feel it when it decides to flex thats just got so much strength there this one didnt swim all the way from the ocean it was most likely born in brackish water just downstream and while only months old it seems to be thriving in freshwater its a scary thought that this river will be its hunting ground for life another years at long and pounds in weight this one could triple in length and become times heavier im just trying to imagine this thing two or three times the length in this water its*****************a frightening prospect in a river a small river anyway this ones going back well ive been able to prove without question that bull sharks are trespassing on my patch in freshwater more than miles up an australian river but critically what ive learned is that they have the capacity for brutal attacks in freshwater almost anywhere there are few limits to where this shark will operate more and more it seems that this freshwater jaws is bringing its savagery into our once-tame backyard along metropolitan canals up quiet rivers and on tranquil lakes the bull shark is looking for its next meal its just a question of who and when,the payara hydrolycus scomberoides is a species of dogtooth tetra this predatory fish is found in the amazon basin in tropical south america it was the first of four species to be described in the genus

chainsaw predator,largetooth sawfish,pristis pristis,my names jeremy wade for as long as i can remember ive had a passion that verges on obsession dangerous freshwater fish have got me well and truly hooked their deadly reputations have always fascinated me as well as their methods of attack i think weve got one thunder crashes in rivers around the world ive seen everything from giant venom-coated stings to tiny assassins that drill into flesh ive held a fish that could slice off my arm smelled the breath of a beast that inhales its victims whole and felt the hammer blow of an 80-pound battering ram yet of all the nasty devices ive come across there is one murderous-looking weapon that really stands out it belongs to a sea monster that swims hundreds of miles up rivers a monster that has completely eluded me until now fish on fish on wade nearly years ago on my first fishing trip to the amazon i was in a hardware store looking for rope and other supplies when i caught sight of something that stopped me dead in my tracks it was about a yard long with a profile just like a chainsaw except that each vicious-looking point was fully inches long what id stumbled upon was the snout or rostrum of a fish the locals called the araguagua this is an animal id been vaguely aware of from my youth but which id never actually seen in the comics and adventure books of my childhood this creature was normally depicted as a sea monster usually brandishing its serrated weapon at terrified skin divers but i dont ever remember seeing a picture of a real one and until that hardware store in brazil id no idea that this large and wickedly armed fish might swim up rivers wade the animal in question is known is english as a sawfish giants over feet long have occasionally been caught and legend has it that these monsters will even attack boats in the 16th century the swedish chronicler olaus magnus states that this terrifying fish will swim under ships and cut them that the water may come in and he may feed on the men when the ship is drowned more recently a story from india talks of a man hacked in two if those accounts sound farfetched then more believable perhaps is this newspaper article from the 1930s about an attack off the coast of florida the story goes that a fisherman harpooned a large sawfish in shallow water but when the brute spun round and struck the boat with its snout the tables were suddenly turned screaming wade i shudder to imagine that rack of teeth scything into human flesh groans despite severe injuries the victim in this instance appears to have survived panting but ive long wondered if the animal that attacked him could be the most fearsome of any fish to lurk in a river as i prepare to go in search of one two questions are at the front of my mind why is such a large sea-dwelling predator coming into freshwater and is the sawfish as deadly as it looks once common throughout the tropics sawfish are now increasingly hard to find commercial fishing in particular has taken a heavy toll decades of overkill have almost wiped them out to track down this rare beast im heading to australias wild northwest birds squawking ive come to the remote fitzroy river one of the last strongholds of the so-called freshwater sawfish somewhere here so ive heard lurks a creature barely changed since the age of the dinosaurs at the mouth of the river i venture into unfamiliar territory this is a no-mans-land of shifting mud and treacherous currents but the dangers i can see are only half the picture hidden below the surface are some of the worlds most notorious man-eaters come on ive been granted special permission to try and catch the critically endangered sawfish this puts me in a truly privileged position yet in such a vast area theres no guarantee ill even find one hundreds of square miles of open water it is ridiculous the warm shallow water at the mouth of the fitzroy is prime sawfish habitat years ago a local fisherman snagged an 18-footer not far from here pretty lively uh yeah thats something yeah if i hadnt seen what was responsible for that i might be getting quite excited there i might be thinking that was something toothy but thats crab claw marks everything is hungry down here wade out of the corner of my eye im aware of a more sinister predator for a saltwater crocodile humans as well as crabs are fair game this wouldnt be a good place to fall in reel winding okay i got something on there this time im hooked into something meaty its only day one but i wonder if im about to get lucky thats actually running back a little back a little back back back oh here we go coming up coming up okay okay hold on hold on hold on im gonna take this easy cause i cant actually i cant get a positive id in the water its very muddy water oh its a shark its a shark this estuarys just full of predators wade bull shark i keep well clear of its mouth even a 5-foot juvenile could bite my hand off the adults can reach feet and probably kill more people than any other shark this is one of the few sea dwellers which like sawfish can swim up rivers chuckles well that was a bit of drama im glad we got that in its always exciting to get a fish like that in on light tackle but a bit of disappointment thats not the fish that im after im after something that looks actually quite similar to that so ive got it all to do again next time the line goes i want it to be a big sawfish not a bull shark physically sawfish resemble sharks quite closely they have shark-like dorsal fins a long body and a high sweeping tail in other ways theyre more like their true ancestors rays the gills for example sit underneath the head is flat and the mouth is a narrow slit but its the snout that intrigues me despite its vicious profile few have ever seen it in action malcolm douglas is an exception this real-life crocodile dundee has witnessed natures very own chainsaw massacre in i was up around darwin and just as we come out of this creek in the morning i saw something i saw a big school of mullet all cruising and all sort of huddling together and i said to my mate i said somethings stressing those mullet and next thing this massive saw come up between them and it just went bang bang bang bang bang faster than a speeding bullet as they say and then he just came through gobbling them up and then he turned around again and he did that several times we just thought that was the most fantastic thing that we ever saw the saw on that i measured it from memory was around about foot long - a saw - yeah the saw itself yeah its huge im not exaggerating im not prone to exaggeration wade this high-spec weapon is stuffed with sensors that pick up not just the movement of nearby animals but also their electrical aura even in total darkness a sawfish can nail its target according to malcolm they also use their saw in self-defense you nearly had a rack of those going into your leg yeah not nice as the dry season comes on here you get the fitzroy gets very shallow right and these sawfish will hang around quite often in the shallow water now if you trap a sawfish between the bank and the deep channel he will come at you with that saw and hell just lash around like this this is his protection now if you get hit in the leg or the arm or the stomach its not a pretty sight itd almost be worse than a crocodile bite because its a rip right through like this you know and then theyd come back and theyd hit you two or three times right wade the dry season is the only time you can explore the fitzroy river at least by vehicle during the rains all of this is underwater i head to a deep channel known as telegraph pool by moving a few miles inland im hoping to improve my chances of catching a sawfish strong tides bring a lot of smaller fish into this lower section of the river making it a rich hunting ground for large predators some are already lining up with crocodiles they say its the ones you cant see that you have to worry about hardly reassuring when they vanish without trace into muddy water were just waiting for nightfall but its good to stay to the tide as well the tide will be coming up soon apparently the sawfish move up with the tide if they move up with the tide i move down with the tide so ive just got a couple of baits out yeah its all looking very fishy at the moment a few locals also brave this spot most are after barramundi a sport fish prized for its fighting spirit in general though anglers want to avoid sawfish which can rip lines as well as flesh to boost my chances ive set up two rods by sunset my baits are still untouched and as darkness falls the mood grows more sinister its not just the crocs that are making me edgy people have lived here for tens of thousands of years and their spirits seem to haunt the shadows with each passing hour i feel more like a trespasser in someone elses world birds squawking daylight comes as a relief and then brings an unexpected breakthrough do you want a hand with that - yeah please - chuckles another fisherman up early before the heat of the day has accidentally hooked a sawfish this 2-footer is a mere pup but an extra pair of hands still doesnt go amiss were you fishing for these or - no barramundi - barramundi right - and ive caught everything but - right - this is the first one of these ive seen - okay im out of range now its only a small one wade this baby sawfish is the monster in miniature and my first chance to get a safe look at this bizarre animal wow right thats the first one of these ive seen imagine one of these things foot long which is what they grow to when they get into the sea but yeah its just like a shark if you look at the back end of it come forward thats just like a rays mouth a stingrays mouth but you know that is the unique feature and even on a small one like this just look you know thats quite a fearsome weapon im actually aware this is a small one very good thing to see because for a fish like this to exist and this is probably about a year old there have to be breeding-size adults around fantastic i wish i caught it myself im here to catch a monster but for now i just want to return the pup unharmed sighs just moving the tail to get the circulation going a bit wade sawfish travel more than miles up the fitzroy river deep into the arid australian outback i want to know why they swim so far into freshwater and how dangerous they are to humans the aborigines have lived with these predators for at least years sawfish feature in their tribal dances and in one of their dream-time stories the animal uses its huge saw to gouge out the rivers of the land well im now over miles from the coast and on my way to meet some of the bunuba tribe they call this stretch of river darngku or deep water and i can see why the white band along the cliffs is a stark warning of how far this river rises during the rains for feet above me the rocks have been scrubbed clean with help from the bunuba im hoping to catch my first sawfish but i also want to find out from them how dangerous it really is since coming here ive already picked up one story of an attack from northern australia years ago two fishermen were smashed clean out of their boat by one of these creatures indistinct shouting what spooks me about this story is not the mens injuries incredibly they escaped virtually unscathed but according to the report the boats solid wooden hull was punctured by the animals teeth such was the force of one of its blows birds squawking the aborigines have long hunted sawfish for food and are still allowed to catch them as an outsider though im not sure how theyll take to me fishing for one in their waters around here its mostly the women who do the fishing so its their knowledge i want to tap into mary aitken is an elder from the bunuba tribe she grew up on this river and begins by recounting the story of a large sawfish that she caught here many years ago wade how many were you and you couldnt take it it seems the fish was almost too big for the back of marys pickup so you just got it on the back of the yeah so what about children when they go fishing here theyre catching small fish and then they get one of these sawfish on the line i mean do they ever get hurt by them wade then mary hands me the largest saw ive ever seen the savage potential of this ready-made weapon certainly hasnt been lost on humans there are records of sawfish rostrums being used as weapons right across the western pacific from the philippines down through new guinea as far as new zealand theyd use it to slice open the abdomens of their enemies and also to open up the veins on the inside of the elbows causing fatal bleeding and even just a couple of years ago here in australia a couple of burglars attacked a man in a caravan using a sawfish rostrum and they put him in hospital footsteps departing but whether the sawfish itself sets out to attack people is less clear so far the evidence is about as shadowy as the beast itself birds calling wade by mid dry season the fitzroy has shrunk from a raging torrent into a series of quiet pools with little or no moving water this ought to concentrate the sawfish and make them easier to find but before i go looking ill need plenty of fresh bait mary catches hers with a throw net and makes it look easy its a method ive seen people use all round the world but have never tried myself whats that is that a bream or something yep the theory could hardly be simpler cast a circle and your net covers the greatest possible area thus snagging more fish all right yeah uh-huh lovely with fresh bait on her line mary is quickly into her fishing meanwhile im getting into a bit of a muddle - laughs - that was a square chuckling after a slow start i finally won some respect and mary lets me in on a few good fishing spots along the gorge sawfish have roamed the earth for at least a hundred million years yet the rocks under my feet are nearly four times this old my walkabout takes me to the top of a limestone cliff the remnant of a once-mighty barrier reef that lay beneath an ancient ocean beyond the horizon parts of this continent date back four billion years thats almost as old as life itself im looking for a stretch of water with a deep channel the kind of place where a big sawfish might lie up ive got the whole river to myself and with limited time im eager to get fishing this is about as simple as fishing gets i suppose just using a hand line so theres the hook down in the water a little bit of lead holding the bait in place and this end just a winder and this is what the locals use so im just giving it a go and theyll tend to go away and just come back and check the line after a couple of hours make sure its fastened to something they tend to look a bit askance at me sitting actually holding the line but you know ive only got a limited time here i want to feel when something comes along make sure the hook sets but from their point of view im wasting energy and also sitting out in the sun unnecessarily all that remains now is to sit and wait for something to find the bait as the hours slip by i try out several spots along the river by midafternoon the only animals ive managed to flush out are a bunch of cockatoos birds squawking surprisingly the shallow pools are still full of life even in the dry season there are plenty of shrimp and bream to be found this will be good ammunition for later as i return to camp i wonder if the abundance of food might explain why sawfish come so far upriver if the pickings are rich enough and you can adapt to freshwater then why not recently in south africa i caught huge adult bull sharks which were swimming way into freshwater for just this reason wade but if the same is true of sawfish then why arent i hearing stories of giant 20-foot river monsters it occurs to me that even here in whats thought to be one of their last strongholds these prehistoric beasts could be vanishing perhaps darkness will draw a sawfish out of its lair its often said theyre more active at night just in case i doze off i tie an empty can to the line should anything run off with the bait the noise of it moving will wake me up im over miles from the mouth of the river here but apparently in the past according to mary there have been some big sawfish caught from this very place wade a long day baking in the outback sun has left me exhausted but my overcooked brain refuses to switch off i still have little sense of how dangerous sawfish are to people back in that hardware store years ago the answer seemed obvious yet for such a large and viciously armed beast id have expected a lot more bad press especially from populated areas where sawfish were once common indistinct shouting after all this is a fish said to have hacked a man in two wade after a day of fishing without success darkness has finally brought me a bite my bare hands take the strain as i wind in the line but the fish on the end is not what im expecting bull shark a bull shark this far inland is a real eye-opener these aggressive fish are clearly thriving here even during the dry season when this part of the river is little more than a stagnant pond so a pretty hostile environment you can see why everything in there basically is tooled up you know the sawfish possibly needs that weaponry for defense who knows anyway id better put this back i just hope i dont hook him up again there he goes even though i know bull sharks come up you know in freshwater you know its still really strange seeing them here but the monster im after is nowhere to be seen wade it was only recently that outsiders realized there were sawfish in this river and began to study them im leaving darngku and heading a hundred miles back downstream to hook up with a small sawfish-research team perhaps their knowledge can help me in my quest i turn off the main highway to a dusty outpost called camballin and then follow a dirt track to an abandoned irrigation dam for most of the year this man-made barrier stops sawfish swimming upstream they accumulate below the dam making this an ideal spot for the research team dr dave morgan who leads the research is passionate about sawfish by tagging and tracking individual fish hes starting to build up a picture of their secret lives but as we head out to set trapping nets were busy watching our backs crocodiles seem to be following our activity with a predatory interest this is risky work if you get too focused on the crocs and take your eye off whats under your nose you can wind up getting karate-chopped by a sawfish in the net just trying to do it from a boat in a deep section thats when you often get hit a lot but when you dont want to get out of the boat cause theres saltwater crocodiles around then yeah you get hit ive yet to lock horns with a sawfish but just the thought of being nailed by a croc is making me jumpy in the dark murky water i cant make out whats in the net yeah definitely is a real kick kick kick like that no can you see that croc bull shark or sawfish this has to be the lucky dip from hell man yeah i saw him yep just be careful mate it could be a bull shark or a freshwater saltwater crocodile will they get round to the nets will they come and take the fish out of the nets well the freshies generally go for catfish but the salties definitely prefer the barramundi im starting to wish i was somewhere else well theyll churn them in the net right so hell try and fight you for them oh shall i attempt to grab that yeah - is that - grab him by the tail just okay well no sawfish in the net but this is a bull shark okay wade id normally be fired up to find bull sharks so far upstream in freshwater but theyre starting to feel like a plague and i wonder how many more i might have to pull out from this crocodile soup before i find a sawfish im told that the annual flood was lower than normal this year making it hard for sawfish to move upstream at any rate the last nets are all empty thunder crashing with cruel irony daylight brings the threat of an unseasonal storm out here in the bush heavy rain can spell trouble birds squawking the timing is absolutely crucial if i was here in the wet season id be sitting underwater which is precisely why we come now in the dry season not only is the river accessible but also the fact that its down about foot the fish are more confined the problem is is that the weather actually is changing we had the wind blowing we had rain last night and theres real concern at the moment that if theres any more rain the tracks leading in here are gonna become impassable so everyones keeping an eye on the weather if there is signs of things turning bad were just gonna have to throw everything in the vehicles and get out of here and that will be a premature end to my mission thunder crashes with a big storm approaching the research team has no choice but to beat a retreat yet it seems there is still a glimmer of hope to stay one step ahead of the weather we head back to telegraph pool wade this is my last chance to catch the monster that ive waited nearly years to see while dave and his team prepare for another night of trapping i return superstitiously perhaps to the exact spot where i released the baby sawfish maybe this is where my prayers will finally be answered birds chirping reel winding oh fish on fish on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good size good size its coming in quite close its already quite im gonna get over these rocks in here im gonna need someone to grab it i think its ready its ready i think oh its a sawfish its a sawfish at last the animal thats been swimming around in my head for nearly years yeah here we go my first sawfish look at this for a beast this things nearly foot long its bigger than i am and that rostrum on there thats a foot and a half long its got of those teeth each one is about an inch long wickedly sharp youve got that huge dorsal fin a very big second dorsal fin a very big tail and they anchor the body and when the body flexes its this head and this rostrum that really scythe from side to side its about to tense we about to have a splash yeah here we go yeah grunts yeah wade this journey began almost years ago in the heart of the amazon i stood staring at a vicious-looking weapon and wondered if id ever see its owner in the flesh now in a remote river in australia i finally got my hands on a live sawfish so i hold that down and the scientists meanwhile think theyve figured out why these creatures come into freshwater its flat on the rostrum daves latest measurements show that theyre using the fitzroy as a nursery acoustic tag going in here despite all the predators its still safer here than in the sea only when they reach or feet long do sawfish leave the river as an adult living in saltwater this fish could one day become a 20-foot giant but i came here to find out if this fish is also a monster in terms of deed now theres no doubt that that fearsome toothed rostrum is potentially a lethal weapon and its certainly been used as such in the hands of humans but i can find just no instance at all of this fish having attacked a human being willfully in other words its monstrous appearance is not matched by its behavior certainly if youre a small fish this thing is a deadly weapon but from the human point of view the sawfish is the archetypal gentle giant sawfish are as tough as they come this one has already shrugged off a shark bite as well as a recent croc attack yet in a world full of nets the very weapon it needs to survive is now liable to get it snagged and killed my only fear as it swims away is that we may be seeing the last of these ancient and extraordinary monsters,the largetooth sawfish pristis pristis syn p microdon and p perotteti is a species of sawfish in the family pristidae it is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions but also enters freshwater it has declined drastically and is now critically endangered a range of english names have been used for the species or populations now part of the species including common sawfish despite it being far from common today wide sawfish freshwater sawfish river sawfish less frequently other sawfish species also occur in freshwater and rivers leichhardts sawfish after explorer and naturalist ludwig leichhardt and northern sawfish taxonomy the taxonomy of pristis pristis in relations to p microdon claimed range indo-west pacific and p perotteti claimed range atlantic and east pacific has historically caused considerable confusion but evidence published in revealed that the three are conspecific as morphological and genetic differences are lacking as a consequence recent authorities treat p microdon and p perotteti as synonyms of p pristis based on an analysis of nadh-2 genes there are three main clades of p pristis atlantic indo-west pacific and east pacific its scientific name pristis both the genus and specific name is derived from the greek word for saw description the largetooth sawfish possibly reaches up to m ft in total length but the largest confirmed was a west african individual that was m ft long an individual caught in at galveston texas which was documented on film but not measured has been estimated to be of similar size today most individuals are far smaller and a typical length is m ft large individuals may weigh as much as kg lb or possibly even more the largetooth sawfish is easily recognized by the forward position of the dorsal fin with its leading edge placed clearly in front of the leading edge of the pelvic fins when the sawfish is seen from above or the side the relatively long pectoral fins with angular tips and the presence of a small lower tail lobe in all other sawfish species the leading edge of their dorsal fin is placed at or behind the leading edge of the pelvic fins and all other pristis sawfish species have shorter pectoral fins with less pointed tips and lack a distinct lower tail lobe very small or none the rostrum saw of the largetooth sawfish has a width that is of its length which is relatively wide compared to the other sawfish species and there are equally separated teeth on each side of it on average females have shorter rostrums with fewer teeth than males the rostral teeth are large and grooved from base to tip the proportional rostrum length also varies with age with average being around of the total length of the fish but can be as high as in juveniles and as low as in adults its upperparts are generally grey to yellowish-brown often with a clear yellow tinge to the fins individuals in freshwater may have a reddish colour caused by blood suffusion below the skin the underside is greyish or white distribution and habitat the largetooth sawfish can be found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions but it also enters freshwater and has been recorded in rivers as far as km mi from the sea historically its east atlantic range was from mauritania to angola there are old reports last in the late 1950s or shortly after from the mediterranean and these have typically been regarded as vagrants but a review of records strongly suggests that this sea had a breeding population its west atlantic range was from uruguay to the caribbean and the gulf of mexico although there are claimed reports from several gulf coast states in the united states a review indicates that only those from texas are genuine other specimens notably several claimed to be from florida were likely imported from other countries its east pacific range was from peru to mazatlan in mexico historically it was widespread in the indo-pacific ranging from south africa to the horn of africa india southeast asia and northern australia its total distribution covered almost km2 sq mi more than any other species of sawfish but it has disappeared from much of its historical range the last record taken in the mediterranean dates back to a parasitic flatworm dermopristis paradoxus is commonly found on the skin and lining of the mouth and exclusively in australian waters on the largetooth sawfish the flatworm has been discovered to have a male reproductive system that lacks the copulatory organ adults are primarily found in estuaries and marine waters to a depth of m ft but mostly less than m ft nevertheless the species does appear to have a greater affinity for freshwater habitats than the smalltooth sawfish p pectinata green sawfish p zijsron and dwarf sawfish p clavata largetooth sawfish from the population in lake nicaragua appear to spend most if not all of their life in freshwater but tagging surveys indicate that at least some do move between this lake and the sea captive studies show that this euryhaline species can thrive long-term in both salt and freshwater regardless of its age and that an acclimation from salt to freshwater is faster than the opposite in captivity they are known to be agile even swimming backwards have an unusual ability to climb with the use of the pectoral fins and they can jump far out of the water a -metre-long ft individual jumped to a height of m ft it has been suggested that this may be adaptions for traversing medium-sized waterfalls and rapids when moving upriver they are generally found in areas with a bottom consisting of sand mud or silt the preferred water temperature is between and c f and c f or colder is lethal behavior and life cycle sexual maturity is reached at a length of about m ft when years old breeding is seasonal in this ovoviviparous species but the exact timing appears to vary depending on the region the adult females can breed once every years the gestation period is about five months and there are indications that mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young there are average c young in each litter which are cm in long at birth they are likely typically born in salt or brackish water near river mouths but move into freshwater where the young spend the first years of their life sometimes as much as km mi upriver in the amazon basin the largetooth sawfish has been reported even further upstream and this mostly involves young individuals that are up to m ft long occasionally young individuals become isolated in freshwater pools during floods and may live there for years the potential lifespan of the largetooth sawfish is unknown but four estimates suggested years years years and years the largetooth sawfish is a predator that feeds on fish molluscs and crustaceans the saw can be used both to stir up the bottom to find prey and to slash at groups of fish sawfish are docile and harmless to humans except when captured where they can inflict serious injuries when defending themselves with the saw conservation as suggested by the alternative name common sawfish it was once plentiful but has now declined drastically leading to it being considered a critically endangered species by the iucn the main threat is overfishing but it also suffers from habitat loss both their fins used in shark fin soup and saw as novelty items are highly valuable and the meat is used as food because of the saw they are particularly prone to becoming entangled in fishing nets historically sawfish were also harvested for the oil in their liver in the niger delta region of southern nigeria sawfish known as oki in ijaw and neighbouring languages are traditionally hunted for their saws which are used in masquerades the largetooth sawfish has been extirpated from many regions where formerly present among the countries where recorded historically it has disappeared from and may have disappeared from another leaving only countries where certainly still present in terms of area this means that it certainly survives in only of its historical range only australia still has a relatively healthy population of the species and this may be the last remaining population in the entire indo-pacific that is of sufficient size to be viable but even it has experienced a decline other places in the indo-pacific where still present even if in very low numbers are off eastern africa the indian subcontinent and papua new guinea and in the east pacific it survives off central america colombia and northern peru whether it survives anywhere in southeast asia is generally unclear but one was captured in the philippines in a country where otherwise considered extirpated the species has disappeared from much of its atlantic range and declined where still present the likely largest remaining population in this region is in the amazon estuary but another important population is in the san juan river system in central america it was once abundant in lake nicaragua part of the san juan river system but this population rapidly crashed during the 1970s when tens of thousands were caught it has been protected in nicaragua since the early 1980s but remains rare in the lake today and is now threatened by the planned nicaragua canal in west africa the bissagos archipelago has often been considered the last remaining stronghold but interviews with locals indicate that sawfish now also are rare there all sawfish species were added to cites appendix i in thereby restricting international trade as the first marine fish there was an attempt of having it listed under the endangered species act esa in by the united states national marine fisheries service but it was declined however it was listed as p perotteti under the esa in following taxonomic changes the esa listing was updated to p pristis in december sawfish are protected in australia and the united states where a number of conservation projects have been initiated but the largetooth sawfish has probably already been extirpated from the latter country last confirmed record in from nueces texas additionally it receives a level of protection in bangladesh brazil guinea india indonesia malaysia mexico nicaragua senegal and south africa but illegal fishing continues enforcement of fishing laws is often lacking and it has already disappeared from some of these countries largetooth sawfish especially young are sometimes eaten by crocodiles and large sharks this species is the most numerous sawfish in public aquariums but it is often listed under the synonym p microdon studbooks included individuals males females in north american aquariums in individuals males females in european aquariums in and individuals males females in australian aquariums in others are kept at public aquariums in asia see also threatened rays

i can remember ive had a passion that verges on obsession dangerous freshwater fish have got me well and truly hooked their deadly reputations have always fascinated me as well as their methods of attack i think weve got one thunder crashes in rivers around the world ive seen everything from giant venom-coated stings to tiny assassins that drill into flesh ive held a fish that could slice off my arm smelled the breath of a beast that inhales its victims whole and felt the hammer blow of an 80-pound battering ram yet of all the nasty devices ive come across there is one murderous-looking weapon that really stands out it belongs to a sea monster that swims hundreds of miles up rivers a monster that has completely eluded me until now fish on fish on wade nearly years ago on my*****************fishing trip to the amazon i was in a hardware store looking for rope and other supplies when i caught sight of something that stopped me dead in my tracks it was about a yard long with a profile just like a chainsaw except that each vicious-looking point was fully inches long what id stumbled upon was the snout or rostrum of a fish the locals called the araguagua this is an animal id been vaguely aware of from my youth but which id never actually seen in the comics and adventure books of my childhood this creature was normally depicted as a sea monster usually brandishing its serrated weapon at terrified skin divers but i dont ever remember*****************a picture of a real one and until that hardware store in brazil id no idea that this large and wickedly armed fish might swim up rivers wade the animal in question is known is english as a sawfish giants over feet long have occasionally been caught and legend has it that these monsters will even attack boats in the 16th century the swedish chronicler olaus magnus states that this terrifying fish will swim under ships and cut them that the water may come in and he may feed on the men when the ship is drowned more recently a story from india talks of a man hacked in two if those accounts sound farfetched then more believable perhaps*****************this newspaper article from the 1930s about an attack off the coast of florida the story goes that a fisherman harpooned a large sawfish in shallow water but when the brute spun round and struck the boat with its snout the tables were suddenly turned screaming wade i shudder to imagine that rack of teeth scything into human flesh groans despite severe injuries the victim in this instance appears to have survived panting but ive long wondered if the animal that attacked him could be the most fearsome of any fish to lurk in a river as i prepare to go in search of one two questions are at the front of my mind why is such a large*****************predator coming into freshwater and is the sawfish as deadly as it looks once common throughout the tropics sawfish are now increasingly hard to find commercial fishing in particular has taken a heavy toll decades of overkill have almost wiped them out to track down this rare beast im heading to australias wild northwest birds squawking ive come to the remote fitzroy river one of the last strongholds of the so-called freshwater sawfish somewhere here so ive heard lurks a creature barely changed since the age of the dinosaurs at the mouth of the river i venture into unfamiliar territory this is a no-mans-land of shifting mud and treacherous currents but the dangers i can see are only half*****************picture hidden below the surface are some of the worlds most notorious man-eaters come on ive been granted special permission to try and catch the critically endangered sawfish this puts me in a truly privileged position yet in such a vast area theres no guarantee ill even find one hundreds of square miles of open water it is ridiculous the warm shallow water at the mouth of the fitzroy is prime sawfish habitat years ago a local fisherman snagged an 18-footer not far from here pretty lively uh yeah thats something yeah if i hadnt seen what was responsible for that i might be getting quite excited there i might be thinking that was something toothy but thats crab*****************marks everything is hungry down here wade out of the corner of my eye im aware of a more sinister predator for a saltwater crocodile humans as well as crabs are fair game this wouldnt be a good place to fall in reel winding okay i got something on there this time im hooked into something meaty its only day one but i wonder if im about to get lucky thats actually running back a little back a little back back back oh here we go coming up coming up okay okay hold on hold on hold on im gonna take this easy cause i cant actually i cant get a positive id in the water its very muddy*****************oh its a shark its a shark this estuarys just full of predators wade bull shark i keep well clear of its mouth even a 5-foot juvenile could bite my hand off the adults can reach feet and probably kill more people than any other shark this is one of the few sea dwellers which like sawfish can swim up rivers chuckles well that was a bit of drama im glad we got that in its always exciting to get a fish like that in on light tackle but a bit of disappointment thats not the fish that im after im after something that looks actually quite similar to that so ive got it all to do again next*****************the line goes i want it to be a big sawfish not a bull shark physically sawfish resemble sharks quite closely they have shark-like dorsal fins a long body and a high sweeping tail in other ways theyre more like their true ancestors rays the gills for example sit underneath the head is flat and the mouth is a narrow slit but its the snout that intrigues me despite its vicious profile few have ever seen it in action malcolm douglas is an exception this real-life crocodile dundee has witnessed natures very own chainsaw massacre in i was up around darwin and just as we come out of this creek in the morning i saw something i saw a*****************measured it from memory was around about foot long - a saw - yeah the saw itself yeah its huge im not exaggerating im not prone to exaggeration wade this high-spec weapon is stuffed with sensors that pick up not just the movement of nearby animals but also their electrical aura even in total darkness a sawfish can nail its target according to malcolm they also use their saw in self-defense you nearly had a rack of those going into your leg yeah not nice as the dry season comes on here you get the fitzroy gets very shallow right and these sawfish will hang around quite often in the shallow water now if you trap a sawfish between the bank and the deep channel he will come at you with that saw and hell just lash around like this this is his protection now if you get hit in*****************leg or the arm or the stomach its not a pretty sight itd almost be worse than a crocodile bite because its a rip right through like this you know and then theyd come back and theyd hit you two or three times right wade the dry season is the only time you can explore the fitzroy river at least by vehicle during the rains all of this is underwater i head to a deep channel known as telegraph pool by moving a few miles inland im hoping to improve my chances of catching a sawfish strong tides bring a lot of smaller fish into this lower section of the river making it a rich hunting ground for large*****************some are already lining up with crocodiles they say its the ones you cant see that you have to worry about hardly reassuring when they vanish without trace into muddy water were just waiting for nightfall but its good to stay to the tide as well the tide will be coming up soon apparently the sawfish move up with the tide if they move up with the tide i move down with the tide so ive just got a couple of baits out yeah its all looking very fishy at the moment a few locals also brave this spot most are after barramundi a sport fish prized for its fighting spirit in general though anglers want to avoid sawfish*****************can rip lines as well as flesh to boost my chances ive set up two rods by sunset my baits are still untouched and as darkness falls the mood grows more sinister its not just the crocs that are making me edgy people have lived here for tens of thousands of years and their spirits seem to haunt the shadows with each passing hour i feel more like a trespasser in someone elses world birds squawking daylight comes as a relief and then brings an unexpected breakthrough do you want a hand with that - yeah please - chuckles another fisherman up early before the heat of the day has accidentally hooked a sawfish this 2-footer is a mere*****************but an extra pair of hands still doesnt go amiss were you fishing for these or - no barramundi - barramundi right - and ive caught everything but - right - this is the first one of these ive seen - okay im out of range now its only a small one wade this baby sawfish is the monster in miniature and my first chance to get a safe look at this bizarre animal wow right thats the first one of these ive seen imagine one of these things foot long which is what they grow to when they get into the sea but yeah its just like a shark if you look at the back end of it*****************forward thats just like a rays mouth a stingrays mouth but you know that is the unique feature and even on a small one like this just look you know thats quite a fearsome weapon im actually aware this is a small one very good thing to see because for a fish like this to exist and this is probably about a year old there have to be breeding-size adults around fantastic i wish i caught it myself im here to catch a monster but for now i just want to return the pup unharmed sighs just moving the tail to get the circulation going a bit wade sawfish travel more than miles up the fitzroy river deep into*****************arid australian outback i want to know why they swim so far into freshwater and how dangerous they are to humans the aborigines have lived with these predators for at least years sawfish feature in their tribal dances and in one of their dream-time stories the animal uses its huge saw to gouge out the rivers of the land well im now over miles from the coast and on my way to meet some of the bunuba tribe they call this stretch of river darngku or deep water and i can see why the white band along the cliffs is a stark warning of how far this river rises during the rains for feet above me the rocks have*****************scrubbed clean with help from the bunuba im hoping to catch my first sawfish but i also want to find out from them how dangerous it really is since coming here ive already picked up one story of an attack from northern australia years ago two fishermen were smashed clean out of their boat by one of these creatures indistinct shouting what spooks me about this story is not the mens injuries incredibly they escaped virtually unscathed but according to the report the boats solid wooden hull was punctured by the animals teeth such was the force of one of its blows birds squawking the aborigines have long hunted sawfish for food and are still allowed to catch them*****************an outsider though im not sure how theyll take to me fishing for one in their waters around here its mostly the women who do the fishing so its their knowledge i want to tap into mary aitken is an elder from the bunuba tribe she grew up on this river and begins by recounting the story of a large sawfish that she caught here many years ago wade how many were you and you couldnt take it it seems the fish was almost too big for the back of marys pickup so you just got it on the back of the yeah so what about children when they go fishing here theyre catching small fish and then they*****************one of these sawfish on the line i mean do they ever get hurt by them wade then mary hands me the largest saw ive ever seen the savage potential of this ready-made weapon certainly hasnt been lost on humans there are records of sawfish rostrums being used as weapons right across the western pacific from the philippines down through new guinea as far as new zealand theyd use it to slice open the abdomens of their enemies and also to open up the veins on the inside of the elbows causing fatal bleeding and even just a couple of years ago here in australia a couple of burglars attacked a man in a caravan using a sawfish rostrum*****************they put him in hospital footsteps departing but whether the sawfish itself sets out to attack people is less clear so far the evidence is about as shadowy as the beast itself birds calling wade by mid dry season the fitzroy has shrunk from a raging torrent into a series of quiet pools with little or no moving water this ought to concentrate the sawfish and make them easier to find but before i go looking ill need plenty of fresh bait mary catches hers with a throw net and makes it look easy its a method ive seen people use all round the world but have never tried myself whats that is that a bream or something yep*****************theory could hardly be simpler cast a circle and your net covers the greatest possible area thus snagging more fish all right yeah uh-huh lovely with fresh bait on her line mary is quickly into her fishing meanwhile im getting into a bit of a muddle - laughs - that was a square chuckling after a slow start i finally won some respect and mary lets me in on a few good fishing spots along the gorge sawfish have roamed the earth for at least a hundred million years yet the rocks under my feet are nearly four times this old my walkabout takes me to the top of a limestone cliff the remnant of a once-mighty barrier reef*****************lay beneath an ancient ocean beyond the horizon parts of this continent date back four billion years thats almost as old as life itself im looking for a stretch of water with a deep channel the kind of place where a big sawfish might lie up ive got the whole river to myself and with limited time im eager to get fishing this is about as simple as fishing gets i suppose just using a hand line so theres the hook down in the water a little bit of lead holding the bait in place and this end just a winder and this is what the locals use so im just giving it a go and theyll tend to*****************as the hours slip by i try out several spots along the river by midafternoon the only animals ive managed to flush out are a bunch of cockatoos birds squawking surprisingly the shallow pools are still full of life even in the dry season there are plenty of shrimp and bream to be found this will be good ammunition for later as i return to camp i wonder if the abundance of food might explain why sawfish come so far upriver if the pickings are rich enough and you can adapt to freshwater then why not recently in south africa i caught huge adult bull sharks which were swimming way into freshwater for just this reason wade but if the same is true of sawfish then why arent i hearing stories of giant 20-foot river monsters it occurs to me that even here in whats thought to be one of*****************last strongholds these prehistoric beasts could be vanishing perhaps darkness will draw a sawfish out of its lair its often said theyre more active at night just in case i doze off i tie an empty can to the line should anything run off with the bait the noise of it moving will wake me up im over miles from the mouth of the river here but apparently in the past according to mary there have been some big sawfish caught from this very place wade a long day baking in the outback sun has left me exhausted but my overcooked brain refuses to switch off i still have little sense of how dangerous sawfish are to people back*****************that hardware store years ago the answer seemed obvious yet for such a large and viciously armed beast id have expected a lot more bad press especially from populated areas where sawfish were once common indistinct shouting after all this is a fish said to have hacked a man in two wade after a day of fishing without success darkness has finally brought me a bite my bare hands take the strain as i wind in the line but the fish on the end is not what im expecting bull shark a bull shark this far inland is a real eye-opener these aggressive fish are clearly thriving here even during the dry season when this part of the river*****************little more than a stagnant pond so a pretty hostile environment you can see why everything in there basically is tooled up you know the sawfish possibly needs that weaponry for defense who knows anyway id better put this back i just hope i dont hook him up again there he goes even though i know bull sharks come up you know in freshwater you know its still really strange seeing them here but the monster im after is nowhere to be seen wade it was only recently that outsiders realized there were sawfish in this river and began to study them im leaving darngku and heading a hundred miles back downstream to hook up with a small sawfish-research*****************perhaps their knowledge can help me in my quest i turn off the main highway to a dusty outpost called camballin and then follow a dirt track to an abandoned irrigation dam for most of the year this man-made barrier stops sawfish swimming upstream they accumulate below the dam making this an ideal spot for the research team dr dave morgan who leads the research is passionate about sawfish by tagging and tracking individual fish hes starting to build up a picture of their secret lives but as we head out to set trapping nets were busy watching our backs crocodiles seem to be following our activity with a predatory interest this is risky work if you get too*****************on the crocs and take your eye off whats under your nose you can wind up getting karate-chopped by a sawfish in the net just trying to do it from a boat in a deep section thats when you often get hit a lot but when you dont want to get out of the boat cause theres saltwater crocodiles around then yeah you get hit ive yet to lock horns with a sawfish but just the thought of being nailed by a croc is making me jumpy in the dark murky water i cant make out whats in the net yeah definitely is a real kick kick kick like that no can you see that croc bull shark or*****************this has to be the lucky dip from hell man yeah i saw him yep just be careful mate it could be a bull shark or a freshwater saltwater crocodile will they get round to the nets will they come and take the fish out of the nets well the freshies generally go for catfish but the salties definitely prefer the barramundi im starting to wish i was somewhere else well theyll churn them in the net right so hell try and fight you for them oh shall i attempt to grab that yeah - is that - grab him by the tail just okay well no sawfish in the net but this is a bull shark okay wade*****************normally be fired up to find bull sharks so far upstream in freshwater but theyre starting to feel like a plague and i wonder how many more i might have to pull out from this crocodile soup before i find a sawfish im told that the annual flood was lower than normal this year making it hard for sawfish to move upstream at any rate the last nets are all empty thunder crashing with cruel irony daylight brings the threat of an unseasonal storm out here in the bush heavy rain can spell trouble birds squawking the timing is absolutely crucial if i was here in the wet season id be sitting underwater which is precisely why we come*****************in the dry season not only is the river accessible but also the fact that its down about foot the fish are more confined the problem is is that the weather actually is changing we had the wind blowing we had rain last night and theres real concern at the moment that if theres any more rain the tracks leading in here are gonna become impassable so everyones keeping an eye on the weather if there is signs of things turning bad were just gonna have to throw everything in the vehicles and get out of here and that will be a premature end to my mission thunder crashes with a big storm approaching the research team has no*****************but to beat a retreat yet it seems there is still a glimmer of hope to stay one step ahead of the weather we head back to telegraph pool wade this is my last chance to catch the monster that ive waited nearly years to see while dave and his team prepare for another night of trapping i return superstitiously perhaps to the exact spot where i released the baby sawfish maybe this is where my prayers will finally be answered birds chirping reel winding oh fish on fish on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good size good size its coming in quite close its already quite im gonna get over these rocks in here im gonna need someone*****************grab it i think its ready its ready i think oh its a sawfish its a sawfish at last the animal thats been swimming around in my head for nearly years yeah here we go my first sawfish look at this for a beast this things nearly foot long its bigger than i am and that rostrum on there thats a foot and a half long its got of those teeth each one is about an inch long wickedly sharp youve got that huge dorsal fin a very big second dorsal fin a very big tail and they anchor the body and when the body flexes its this head and this rostrum that really scythe from side to side*****************about to tense we about to have a splash yeah here we go yeah grunts yeah wade this journey began almost years ago in the heart of the amazon i stood staring at a vicious-looking weapon and wondered if id ever see its owner in the flesh now in a remote river in australia i finally got my hands on a live sawfish so i hold that down and the scientists meanwhile think theyve figured out why these creatures come into freshwater its flat on the rostrum daves latest measurements show that theyre using the fitzroy as a nursery acoustic tag going in here despite all the predators its still safer here than in the sea only when they*****************or feet long do sawfish leave the river as an adult living in saltwater this fish could one day become a 20-foot giant but i came here to find out if this fish is also a monster in terms of deed now theres no doubt that that fearsome toothed rostrum is potentially a lethal weapon and its certainly been used as such in the hands of humans but i can find just no instance at all of this fish having attacked a human being willfully in other words its monstrous appearance is not matched by its behavior certainly if youre a small fish this thing is a deadly weapon but from the human point of view the sawfish is*****************archetypal gentle giant sawfish are as tough as they come this one has already shrugged off a shark bite as well as a recent croc attack yet in a world full of nets the very weapon it needs to survive is now liable to get it snagged and killed my only fear as it swims away is that we may be seeing the last of these ancient and extraordinary monsters,the largetooth sawfish pristis pristis syn p microdon and p perotteti is a species of sawfish in the family pristidae it is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions but also enters freshwater it has declined drastically and is now critically endangered a range of english names have been used for the species or populations now part of the species including common sawfish despite it being far from common today wide sawfish freshwater sawfish river sawfish less frequently other sawfish species also occur in freshwater and rivers leichhardts sawfish after explorer and naturalist ludwig leichhardt and northern sawfish taxonomy the taxonomy of pristis pristis in relations to p microdon claimed range indo-west pacific and p perotteti claimed range atlantic and east pacific has historically caused considerable confusion but evidence published in revealed that the three are conspecific as morphological and genetic differences are lacking as a consequence recent authorities*****************p microdon and p perotteti as synonyms of p pristis based on an analysis of nadh-2 genes there are three main clades of p pristis atlantic indo-west pacific and east pacific its scientific name pristis both the genus and specific name is derived from the greek word for saw description the largetooth sawfish possibly reaches up to m ft in total length but the largest confirmed was a west african individual that was m ft long an individual caught in at galveston texas which was documented on film but not measured has been estimated to be of similar size today most individuals are far smaller and a typical length is m ft large individuals may weigh as much as*****************lb or possibly even more the largetooth sawfish is easily recognized by the forward position of the dorsal fin with its leading edge placed clearly in front of the leading edge of the pelvic fins when the sawfish is seen from above or the side the relatively long pectoral fins with angular tips and the presence of a small lower tail lobe in all other sawfish species the leading edge of their dorsal fin is placed at or behind the leading edge of the pelvic fins and all other pristis sawfish species have shorter pectoral fins with less pointed tips and lack a distinct lower tail lobe very small or none the rostrum saw of the largetooth sawfish has*****************width that is of its length which is relatively wide compared to the other sawfish species and there are equally separated teeth on each side of it on average females have shorter rostrums with fewer teeth than males the rostral teeth are large and grooved from base to tip the proportional rostrum length also varies with age with average being around of the total length of the fish but can be as high as in juveniles and as low as in adults its upperparts are generally grey to yellowish-brown often with a clear yellow tinge to the fins individuals in freshwater may have a reddish colour caused by blood suffusion below the skin the underside is greyish or white*****************and habitat the largetooth sawfish can be found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions but it also enters freshwater and has been recorded in rivers as far as km mi from the sea historically its east atlantic range was from mauritania to angola there are old reports last in the late 1950s or shortly after from the mediterranean and these have typically been regarded as vagrants but a review of records strongly suggests that this sea had a breeding population its west atlantic range was from uruguay to the caribbean and the gulf of mexico although there are claimed reports from several gulf coast states in the united states a review indicates that only those from texas are*****************other specimens notably several claimed to be from florida were likely imported from other countries its east pacific range was from peru to mazatlan in mexico historically it was widespread in the indo-pacific ranging from south africa to the horn of africa india southeast asia and northern australia its total distribution covered almost km2 sq mi more than any other species of sawfish but it has disappeared from much of its historical range the last record taken in the mediterranean dates back to a parasitic flatworm dermopristis paradoxus is commonly found on the skin and lining of the mouth and exclusively in australian waters on the largetooth sawfish the flatworm has been discovered to have a male reproductive system*****************lacks the copulatory organ adults are primarily found in estuaries and marine waters to a depth of m ft but mostly less than m ft nevertheless the species does appear to have a greater affinity for freshwater habitats than the smalltooth sawfish p pectinata green sawfish p zijsron and dwarf sawfish p clavata largetooth sawfish from the population in lake nicaragua appear to spend most if not all of their life in freshwater but tagging surveys indicate that at least some do move between this lake and the sea captive studies show that this euryhaline species can thrive long-term in both salt and freshwater regardless of its age and that an acclimation from salt to freshwater is faster than*****************f or colder is lethal behavior and life cycle sexual maturity is reached at a length of about m ft when years old breeding is seasonal in this ovoviviparous species but the exact timing appears to vary depending on the region the adult females can breed once every years the gestation period is about five months and there are indications that mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young there are average c young in each litter which are cm in long at birth they are likely typically born in salt or brackish water near river mouths but move into freshwater where the young spend the first years of their life sometimes as much as km mi upriver in the amazon basin the largetooth sawfish has been reported even further upstream and this mostly involves young individuals that are up to m*****************long occasionally young individuals become isolated in freshwater pools during floods and may live there for years the potential lifespan of the largetooth sawfish is unknown but four estimates suggested years years years and years the largetooth sawfish is a predator that feeds on fish molluscs and crustaceans the saw can be used both to stir up the bottom to find prey and to slash at groups of fish sawfish are docile and harmless to humans except when captured where they can inflict serious injuries when defending themselves with the saw conservation as suggested by the alternative name common sawfish it was once plentiful but has now declined drastically leading to it being considered a critically endangered species by*****************iucn the main threat is overfishing but it also suffers from habitat loss both their fins used in shark fin soup and saw as novelty items are highly valuable and the meat is used as food because of the saw they are particularly prone to becoming entangled in fishing nets historically sawfish were also harvested for the oil in their liver in the niger delta region of southern nigeria sawfish known as oki in ijaw and neighbouring languages are traditionally hunted for their saws which are used in masquerades the largetooth sawfish has been extirpated from many regions where formerly present among the countries where recorded historically it has disappeared from and may have disappeared from another leaving only*****************where certainly still present in terms of area this means that it certainly survives in only of its historical range only australia still has a relatively healthy population of the species and this may be the last remaining population in the entire indo-pacific that is of sufficient size to be viable but even it has experienced a decline other places in the indo-pacific where still present even if in very low numbers are off eastern africa the indian subcontinent and papua new guinea and in the east pacific it survives off central america colombia and northern peru whether it survives anywhere in southeast asia is generally unclear but one was captured in the philippines in a country where otherwise*****************extirpated the species has disappeared from much of its atlantic range and declined where still present the likely largest remaining population in this region is in the amazon estuary but another important population is in the san juan river system in central america it was once abundant in lake nicaragua part of the san juan river system but this population rapidly crashed during the 1970s when tens of thousands were caught it has been protected in nicaragua since the early 1980s but remains rare in the lake today and is now threatened by the planned nicaragua canal in west africa the bissagos archipelago has often been considered the last remaining stronghold but interviews with locals indicate that sawfish now*****************are rare there all sawfish species were added to cites appendix i in thereby restricting international trade as the first marine fish there was an attempt of having it listed under the endangered species act esa in by the united states national marine fisheries service but it was declined however it was listed as p perotteti under the esa in following taxonomic changes the esa listing was updated to p pristis in december sawfish are protected in australia and the united states where a number of conservation projects have been initiated but the largetooth sawfish has probably already been extirpated from the latter country last confirmed record in from nueces texas additionally it receives a level of protection in*****************brazil guinea india indonesia malaysia mexico nicaragua senegal and south africa but illegal fishing continues enforcement of fishing laws is often lacking and it has already disappeared from some of these

electric executioner,electric eel,electrophorus electricus,wade im jeremy wade biologist and monster wrangler grunts ive spent the last years traveling the globe bringing in these giants there it is look at that for a fish much of this time was in brazil where ive caught many monsters before red-belly piranha horse whinnies im back to investigate a new story about a triple homicide the people who fell in the water actually disappeared this is like no creature ive tackled before but this thing is different it has invisible powers chasing this monster takes me into the heart of brazils rugged frontier where people fear for my life he says it will kill you no two ways about it and it leads to possibly the strangest monster catch of my career electricity crackles ive chased river monsters all over the world but ive always considered brazil my second home theres the fish theres the fish this is where ive done most of my fishing look at this catching all manner of freshwater killers ive been drawn back by a chilling story about the death of a group of cowboys ive heard of a river monster taking an individual before man screams but never three people at once this is a new killer for me wade my journey begins in brazils wild west para state is cowboy country and outsiders rarely visit but im on my way to meet an eyewitness to the cowboys deaths im traveling by boat along the tocantins river so i can start fishing immediately and see what killers are in this area during the wet season this river is connected to the place where the cowboys died so the monster could have escaped into these waters i dont know yet what could be down there so i have to be prepared for anything this is actually a fish i bought down at the market this morning its just a tasty scaly fish im just gonna cut the tail off and use that i think its a big river this and so what youre not doing is casting at random because the fish wont be distributed at random but what weve got here is quite turbulent and its also moving back on itself near the banks so its the kind of place where food coming down the river would settle and thats going to cause the small fish to congregate and then right on up the food chain its up from the bottom its not long before i get my first bite oop i think somethings nibbling that grunts yep thats a piranha its a black piranha the black piranha is the largest of the piranha family growing up to a foot and a half long a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth has given piranhas a fearsome reputation and its well earned two years ago i found a story about a young boy who was devoured by piranhas in front of his grandparents speaking native language all they got in was bones wade its unlikely that piranhas would have killed all three cowboys but i know from experience that youve got to keep an open mind only eliminating a suspect after youve heard all the evidence which is why im meeting a witness tomorrow before i track him down ill see what other potential suspects are here it must be a predators paradise down there within minutes something else has grabbed my bait this feels much bigger than a black piranha gosh this is strong this is strong its rising up in the wa there it is oh its a ray its a ray look at the size of that this is the first spotted river ray ive ever caught ive come across stingrays before in thailand ive seen how they can seriously injure people man screaming i want to take a closer look but im not sure how to safely haul it into the boat my worry with this fish is getting too close to it oh speaking foreign language conversing in foreign language its tail has a venomous spike inches long which could whip round and stab me as i pull it in wade taking it to shore and pulling it onto the bank is the best option on close inspection im reminded that this can kill as well that spine there very dangerous its just like a knife inches long that would go in your flesh very easily be very painful and actually if thats in the wrong part of your body that could puncture an artery that could be fatal and these here look at those they dont look very nice either like piranha this is an unlikely suspect for killing three people at the same time but ill need to hear the witnesss account before i can take it off the list ive arranged to meet him near where the deaths occurred just outside the small town of el dorado for the last leg of my journey i leave the boat behind and drive cross-country im comfortable in the brazilian rainforest but this area is unfamiliar to me and im not sure what to expect the whole area was cleared decades ago by ranchers and gold prospectors all the wild animals were chased out or killed making it safe for livestock and humans but it seems that a deadly water predator has managed to cling on the cowboys deaths are still raw in the minds of many and ive been refused access to where they died conversing in foreign language i meet the witness jesunaldo at a nearby farm instead okay speaking native language he tells me that it happened during the wet season when the pastures were flooded a mule had become stuck in the water jesunaldo and five other cowboys tried to rescue it what they had to do was actually sort of go in and just try and pull the animal out the first three cowboys went into the water jesunaldo and the others hung back braying as the first horses got up to their bellies something startled them horse whinnies all three cowboys were thrown into the water the others immediately got out before it was too late - speaking native language wade mm mm i just asked why he didnt just jump straight in to try and help them and he said something told me there was something in the water it wasnt safe didnt want to be number four the fourth victim speaking native language people who fell in the water actually disappeared and were talking water that was it sounds like or feet deep speaking native language mmm i asked him what that leaves him feeling like this was six years ago that it happened and he said its left this sort of lingering sadness from having lost his colleagues jesunaldos story helps me eliminate some potential suspects piranhas can definitely be taken off the list when piranhas attack its an unmistakable feeding frenzy with the water looking as though its boiling but jesunaldo saw only a calm surface speaking foreign language also from jesunaldos account stingrays can be struck off the list if the cowboys had been fatally stabbed by rays there would have been huge amounts of blood in the water which he didnt see jesunaldo has his own theory about the killers identity speaking native language hes given me the name of a terrifying new suspect for the cowboy killer its a creature ive heard about but never encountered now he says although he didnt actually see anything i mean hes pretty certain that you know this was electric eels that caused these three men to die i have a prime suspect a monster said to have mythical powers and one i always feared i might encounter now i have to try to catch one known locally as poraque the electric eel isnt actually an eel at all its a member of the knife fish family they can be found throughout the amazon and orinoco river basins they can grow to over feet long and deliver a charge thats enough to light up a house but is this enough to shock a human being to death ive heard stories about electric eels killing people before but theyve never been proven ive also heard of murderers blaming electric eels to cover their misdeeds but could an eel really kill three people at one time i have my doubts there are many other animals in these waters that are documented killers such as anacondas and caimans victims of these predators bear the telltale marks of bites or strangulation clues that help identify the culprit a victim of electrocution would have no such marks my job now is to find out what state the cowboys corpses were in when they were recovered to do this jesunaldo has put me in contact with a man called hermes speaking foreign language he discovered the bodies the next day speaking native language he tells me that the grim search for the three bodies started where the cowboys disappeared speaking native language they actually got boats with motors in the water and they were driving those around to create a disturbance the wash from the propellers would churn up anything lying below the surface speaking native language there were no bite marks or anything like that on the bodies having no bites is in line with the prime suspect being an electric eel and hermes has one final revelation about the recovered bodies all three had their hands clenched and inside the hands were weed or grass from the bottom of the water clenched hands are a telltale clue wade when a person receives a large electric shock the bodys muscles begin to spasm which could explain why the cowboys died with their hands clenched this is all strong evidence that an electric eel might be responsible for the cowboys deaths but i wonder how much real proof im going to find electricity crackles ive got to catch one and see for myself what these fish are capable of normally i can see what im up against massive teeth cavernous mouths and tails that can fatally stab you the electric eels invisible powers make it unlike any fish ive gone after before im hoping to gain some local knowledge at the towns fish market the people here are those most likely to have come up against them everywhere i look are toothy dangerous fish but electric eels arent on the menu speaking native language fishermen dont fish for them and the reason they dont fish for them is that they say the shock is very powerful wade electric eels or poraque have been striking fear into peoples hearts since long before europeans arrived in the 16th century before electricity was understood brazils indigenous tupi people told of a warrior who carelessly dropped a lightning bolt on an eel giving the fish its mysterious power wade in reality its the eels specially adapted muscles that generate the large shocks but does this electricity kill somebody outright or do they drown after being paralyzed speaking foreign language when i tell people about my mission to catch one theyre in no doubt about what will happen to me one way or the other he says it will kill you no two ways about it - no - no dont mess with it basically dont mess with it when i said is it strong enough to kill he said yeah absolutely no doubt about it its looking like it could be a bit of a mission i would normally try to apprehend my suspect at the scene of the crime but quite apart from the ranch owners sensitivities im here at the height of the dry season the water levels have dropped and the spot where the cowboys died is now just pasture all the fish are now concentrated in the remaining water in theory making them easier to find its possible that the monster could have moved into the nearest big river the araguaia one thing is playing on my mind since nobody fishes for electric eels i havent been able to get any advice on how to catch them ive been warned theyre elusive and tend to show up when least expected all i can realistically do is put a bait in the water and hope an electric eel takes it before something else does the thing is theres loads of predators in these waters so you know ive got a bait on the bottom here but you know theres lots of other species that could pick it up you know theres no way really to single out the electric eel i know im doing the right thing to catch one but something else could beat it to the bait because i dont want to get a nasty shock when i catch an electric eel im taking some precautions the nylon line im using wont conduct electricity so ill be safe while bringing it in then once i get it to the boat i have a thick pair of rubber boots and gloves which means ill be able to handle it without getting shocked my theory that the fish should be more concentrated here seems to be correct as something takes my bait within a matter of minutes whoa theres something on the end of my line and its putting up a powerful fight chuckles i dont think its an electric eel its too strong the back of an electric eels body is mostly used to produce electricity it doesnt have the muscle to put up a struggle like this ah yeah you see the bubbles come out thats a big red-tail catfish big red-tail catfish out of the water it gulps in air blowing it out through its gill flaps got it got it got it got it very strong fish but it tends to not have the stamina but i mean another thing to remark about this fish its about of the body is his head huge head chuckles look at this this river is just full of predators theres a big chunk of fin missing there i get the fish back in the water so it can recover before i let it go this proves my point what i was saying earlier on you throw a bit of dead fish in this river and theres anything that could take it you know could be an electric eel thats what i was hoping for but you know it could just as likely be one of these red-tail catfish that was a great catch but unfortunately its not the fish im after i need to find out more about electric eels anything about them which may help me catch one im meeting up with a fish expert from the university of para dr jonathan reddy he has a couple of specimens in a tank so i can get my first proper look at an electric eel these fish are using their electric capability all the time theyre constantly sending out little pulses smaller eels like these deliver a less-powerful shock than the larger ones but they can still pack a punch wearing protective rubber gloves jonathan shows me this by hooking one up to a bank of leds electricity crackles it lights them up using muscles that have been modified into thousands of special cells which work in a similar way to aa batteries each individual cell generates around of a volt but when they all fire together a large pulse is produced it uses this high voltage to shock prey and for defense so this voltage is just for a very short while volts and the bigger eels theyre known to be up to volts maybe even above thats almost the same as the voltage produced by a heart defibrillator electric eels also generate a low-energy pulse of around volts which they use to survey their surroundings helping to compensate for their poor eyesight it can see even in muddy water by using its electroreceptors to detect distortions in its electrical field a pulse is emitted every few seconds and these can be picked up by placing electrodes in the water and amplifying the signal there you see a wave of signals as they try and work out whats going on popping so my finger in there wouldnt feel this - its only - you wouldnt feel this small orienting pulses are harmless but the bigger shocks are up to times more powerful and can travel through water when theyre about to stun something do you get much warning if theyre gonna do that - yes do i hear a you will get some kind of warning but it might not be too much for you to react in time popping there you go no problems chuckles no shock this time im hoping this equipment will help me locate them in the wild wade electric eels are proving to be very elusive and large rivers have too many places to hide a farmer called milton knows the perfect place where electric eels could be trapped im going to fish in a small lake which got cut off when the water levels dropped at the start of the dry season its miles inland from the araguaia so he gives me and my boat a lift electric eels come up for air every to minutes they get of their oxygen by absorbing it through blood vessels in the mouth if i pick up a signal and wait ill know im in the right position to spot one when it comes up to breathe now there was something just surfaced made some rings just by that bit of wood there which could have been an electric eel coming up for air im not hearing anything ive swept the entire lake with no success well this equipment worked very well in the tank but its not really picking up anything here that i can recognize as being definitely electric eel so i think im gonna return to doing what i know best and that is getting a line in the water next to the lake is a small pond milton tells me its full of a toothy fish called trahira which he says is good for bait he gives me a bamboo rod to catch them as the locals do most fishing youre being quite stealthy youre creeping up youre putting the bait in the water quietly trahira are very inquisitive they lie in shallow water and if they hear a sound rather than head in the opposite direction they actually come and investigate ah thats a trahira those teeth are probably almost as vicious as a piranhas its a bit gap-toothed but those teeth are very sharp thats a start towards getting some bait unlike electric eels trahira are proving incredibly easy to catch theyre also very slippery its like a bar of soap with teeth oh progress stops when my hook gets caught on an underwater branch im not prepared for what i find at the end of my snagged line oh oh oh oh bleep but its a case of mistaken identity its actually not an electric eel that is an eel wade this is a masoom it may look like a true eel but it is in fact another elongated fish for a moment there i was worried i saw this long snakelike thing on the line and i wasnt hanging around to have a close look i was out of the water if this was an electric eel this size that could be potentially fatal strange sort of admission to make im actually glad that wasnt the fish that i was after im not having much luck catching an electric eel its proving far harder to find than i expected but ive gotten word of another attack and im heading out to investigate it happened in on a farm near vila nova where a 21-year-old farm worker called francisco died in a small pond ive traveled there to meet up with his friend fernando the only witness to franciscos last moments speaking native language francisco had only been working at the farm for two weeks when he decided to go fishing in a nearby pond conversing in native language fernando warned him about the electric eels hed seen there but francisco carried on anyway they were fishing with a sort of basket you go in the water and you run this along the bottom of the pond and then you see if you got any fish in the basket speaking native language and he said you know they tried a couple of times hadnt caught anything fernando was staying on the bank he didnt want to get in the water on the third scoop of the basket francisco disappeared and so what he did he ran for help came back with two other people and when they got there there was no sign of anybody no sign of francisco they started searching for his body by dragging a wooden hoe through the water speaking foreign language eventually franciscos body rose to the surface with a macabre addition speaking native language the body of the eel was wrapped around the boys body only when it was pulled right into the shallows did it actually then disappear back into the water now fernandos saying that like me you know hed heard stories that this is a fish thats capable of killing people but he didnt really believe that hadnt heard anything very definite and so when he saw what actually did happen he said he almost didnt believe it ive never heard of a situation of someone being killed by a fish in such a small volume of water but the other thing that really struck me was that unlike the case of the three cowboys who were killed i mean here there was absolutely no doubt what animal was responsible there was a positive id you know this was an electric eel that killed francisco finally clear evidence of an electric eel causing a human death what i dont know though is whether victims drown after being shocked or die from electrocution ive tracked down dr evo panovich the pathologist who performed franciscos autopsy wade speaking foreign language speaking native language so i just asked dr panovich a simple question is the electric eel capable of killing a human being and the answer a very clear yes he goes on to tell me exactly how francisco died speaking foreign language it sounds like it was actually really the heart was stopped so instead of actually contracting strongly to circulate the blood it had gone into some kind of fibrillation in that kind of situation you know drowning is almost secondary the immediate cause of the death was the electricity of the fish this is exactly the evidence ive been searching for theres only one thing left to do catch the culprit without ending up on dr evos slab the locals tell me electric eels lurk here im wearing my protective rubber boots and the rubber gloves are on standby in case i catch one ive just seen something surface ive also ditched my carbon-fiber rod in favor of a bamboo pole perfect for small ponds like this and with the added advantage that it wont conduct electricity its trahira whoops once again aggressive trahira are proving no problem to catch actually thought that might have been an electric eel because the take was not characteristic of trahira trahira makes a very sort of jagged quick take that was quite fiddly and the line going out slowly so i thought it might have been an electric eel but another trahira wade im becoming increasingly frustrated because the final question still lingers is one eel capable of killing three men horse whinnies little is known about electric-eel behavior so just seeing one in the wild never mind catching one might help me answer this last question i know now that this is an animal thats capable of killing people its got nothing to fear from other animals and at times it certainly seems to be pretty bold but you know where are they i think you know ive got to give this some real serious thought about what i do now if im actually to succeed in catching one of these things the electric eels elusiveness isnt the only thing going against me thunder crashes it was on a night like this when according to tupi legend the ancestral electric eel received its heaven-sent powers when a lightning bolt was dropped on it but the rain thats falling for the first time in months is about to make my job much harder soon the eels will no longer be concentrated in the shallow dry-season ponds thunder rumbles i was getting close but with this you know it could mean that my window of opportunity is rapidly closing it could actually be too late this could ruin it this could mean that i actually dont find my electric eel the water is rising and all the small ponds and waterways are starting to link up again allowing the eels to disperse this makes an already elusive creature nearly impossible to find my best option is to travel east to where the rains havent yet hit i fish as i go but im still catching everything but an electric eel this is a thing called a fidalgo its a type of catfish not an electric eel my last hope is an area just southwest of maraba where its still tinder dry and fires are burning everywhere the water here is at its absolute lowest and at daybreak ill have the best chance im going to get before the rains sweep in after asking around i get a promising lead about a tiny pool right in the middle of cattle pasture conversing in foreign language its more like a mud puddle the last place id expect to find a river monster speaking foreign language finally after days of searching a giant electric eel is right in front of me that looked like just one of these branches one of these roots that is an electric eel its a big one now ive got to work up the nerve to catch it im just making a bit of a trench from my point of view itll be easier to handle if theres some kind of sort of notch that its in rather than its being able to slip and slide all over the place my normal capture method would be useless in water this shallow so out goes the rod and in comes a lasso fitting for cowboy country because electric eels dont rely on physical strength pulling it out of the water shouldnt be that hard but not getting shocked will be so protective clothing is essential weve got a plan the plan is not so much to sort of go after the head with the noose but to position that and then get it to go through the noose just taking a few deep breaths because one slip and you know it could be very nasty indeed need to be so focused and so careful about this an eel this size can deliver a shock of volts thats enough to stop my heart in seconds first go amazing first go electric eels can keep on shocking out of water but the rubber gloves were wearing protect us from this look at the colors on this thing these are i got to get it clean that is its doing - it looks like a muscle contraction spasm almost and thats when its actually shocking wade because electric eels get most of their oxygen from breathing air they can stay out of water for long periods of time thats 12 thats pretty much exactly the same as me this is exactly the same size as the eel that killed francisco the 21-year-old man who died in a tiny pond near vila nova wade if i wasnt wearing these rubber gloves i could be dead too its over degrees and i dont want the fish to overheat so time it went back in the water whoa the pond may be shallow at the moment but the rains are not far behind me the waters will soon rise giving this eel the freedom to roam once again my search led me to this tiny drying-out puddle i mean the water in there is barely inches deep its the last place youd expect to find a river monster but thats where it was man speaking native language theres more theres more theres more its not just this big one theres again it looks like wood but its started moving were watching it and it looks like theres actually several but smaller right in with these roots here ive just never seen anything like this before its like a tangle of bodies im just trying to count the heads the more i look the more i see i was thinking or a dozen i think there could be down here this is an incredible discovery and answers the final question about how the cowboys died wade i believe a group of electric eels like this was trapped in a pool over the dry season when the rains came the water levels got higher until the eels could all leave into the swelling waterways it was in these waterways where the trio of unlucky cowboys came across them after their startled horses threw them into the water each one of these eels could deliver a fatal shock so a group of would easily be capable of killing the cowboys this journey has once again proved to me that theres no end to lethal river monsters and that they can be found anywhere who knows where ill find one next,electrophorus electricus is the best-known species of electric eel it is a south american electric fish until the discovery of two additional species in the genus was classified as the monotypic with this species the only one in the genus3 despite the name it is not an eel but rather a knifefish4 it is considered as a freshwater teleost which contains an electrogenic tissue that produces electric discharges5 taxonomic history the species has been reclassified several times when originally described by carl linnaeus in he used the name gymnotus electricus placing it in the same genus as gymnotus carapo banded knifefish which he had described several years earlier it was only about a century later in that the electric eel was moved to its own genus electrophorus by theodore gill6 in september david de santana et al suggested the division of the genus into three species based on dna divergence ecology and habitat anatomy and physiology and electrical ability e electricus e voltai sp nov and e varii sp nov the study found e electricus to be the sister species to e voltai with both species diverging during the pliocene3 anatomy comparison of the three species of electrophorus e electricus has an elongated cylindrical body typically growing to about m ft in in length and kg lb in weight7 their coloration is dark gray-brown on the back and yellow or orange on the belly mature females have a darker abdomen they have no scales the mouth is square and positioned at the end of the snout the anal fin extends the length of the body to the tip of the tail as in other ostariophysan fishes the swim bladder has two chambers the anterior chamber is connected to the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the weberian apparatus which greatly enhances its hearing capability the posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fishs buoyancy e electricus has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its buccal cavity8 as obligate air-breathers e electricus must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way9 physiology further information electric eel electrophysiology e electricus has three pairs of abdominal organs that produce electricity the main organ hunters organ and sachs organ these organs occupy a large part of its body and give the electric eel the ability to generate two types of electric organ discharges low voltage and high voltage these organs are made of electrocytes lined up so a current of ions can flow through them and stacked so each one adds to a potential difference10 the three electrical organs are developed from muscle and exhibit several biochemical properties and morphological features of the muscle sarcolemma they are found symmetrically along both sides of the eel5 when the eel finds its prey the brain sends a signal through the nervous system to the electrocytes this opens the ion channels allowing sodium to flow through reversing the polarity momentarily by causing a sudden difference in electric potential it generates an electric current in a manner similar to a battery in which stacked plates each produce an electric potential difference10 electric eels are also capable of controlling their preys nervous systems with their electrical abilities by controlling their victims nervous system and muscles via electrical pulses they can keep prey from escaping or force it to move so they can locate its position1112 electric eels use electricity in multiple ways low voltages are used to sense the surrounding environment high voltages are used to detect prey and separately stun them at which point the electric eel applies a suction-feeding bite13 anatomy of an electric eels electric organs sachs organ is associated with electrolocation inside the organ are many muscle-like cells called electrocytes each cell produces v the cells being stacked in series to enable the organ to generate nearly v at around hz in frequency these signals are emitted by the main organ hunters organ can emit signals at rates of several hundred hertz14 there are several physiological differences among the three electric organs which allow them to have very different functions the main electrical organ and the strong-voltage section of hunters organ are rich in calmodulin a protein that is involved in high-voltage production15 additionally the three organs have varying amounts of nak-atpase which is a nak ion pump that is crucial in the formation of voltage the main and hunters organs have a high expression of this protein giving it a high sensitivity to changes in ion concentration whereas sachs organ has a low expression of this protein16 the typical output is sufficient to stun or deter virtually any animal the eels can vary the intensity of the electric discharge using lower discharges for hunting and higher intensities for stunning prey or defending themselves they can also concentrate the discharge by curling up and making contact at two points along its body17 when agitated they can produce these intermittent electric shocks over at least an hour without tiringcitation needed e electricus also possesses high frequencysensitive tuberous receptors which are distributed in patches over its body this feature is apparently useful for hunting other gymnotiformes14 e electricus has been prominent in the study of bioelectricity since the 18th century18 the species is of some interest to researchers who make use of its acetylcholinesterase and adenosine triphosphate1920 despite being the first described species in the genus and thus the most famous example e electricus actually has the weakest maximum voltage of the three species in the genus at only volts as opposed to volts in e varii and volts in e voltai3 ecology and life history electric eel at the new england aquarium habitat e electricus is restricted to freshwater habitats in the guiana shield populations in the amazon basin brazilian shield and other parts of the guiana shield are now thought to belong to e varii and e voltai21 feeding ecology e electricus feeds on invertebrates although adult eels may also consume fish and small mammals such as rats first-born hatchlings eat other eggs and embryos from later clutches14 the juveniles eat invertebrates such as shrimp and crabs reproduction e electricus is known for its unusual breeding behavior in the dry season a male eel makes a nest from his saliva into which the female lays her eggs as many as young hatch from the eggs in one nest males grow to be larger than females2223 by about cm in classification names common names synonyms catalog of

unknown,27877,5051,15467,2414,wade im jeremy wade biologist and monster wrangler grunts ive spent the last years traveling the globe bringing in these giants there it is look at that for a fish much of this time was in brazil where ive caught many monsters before red-belly piranha horse whinnies im back to investigate a new story about a triple homicide the people who fell in the water actually disappeared this is like no creature ive tackled before but this thing is different it has invisible powers chasing this monster takes me into the heart of brazils rugged frontier where people fear for my life he says it will kill you no two ways about it and it leads to possibly the strangest monster catch of my career electricity crackles ive chased river monsters all over the world but ive always considered brazil my second home theres the fish theres the fish this*****************where ive done most of my fishing look at this catching all manner of freshwater killers ive been drawn back by a chilling story about the death of a group of cowboys ive heard of a river monster taking an individual before man screams but never three people at once this is a new killer for me wade my journey begins in brazils wild west para state is cowboy country and outsiders rarely visit but im on my way to meet an eyewitness to the cowboys deaths im traveling by boat along the tocantins river so i can start fishing immediately and see what killers are in this area during the wet season this river is connected to the*****************where the cowboys died so the monster could have escaped into these waters i dont know yet what could be down there so i have to be prepared for anything this is actually a fish i bought down at the market this morning its just a tasty scaly fish im just gonna cut the tail off and use that i think its a big river this and so what youre not doing is casting at random because the fish wont be distributed at random but what weve got here is quite turbulent and its also moving back on itself near the banks so its the kind of place where food coming down the river would settle and thats going*****************cause the small fish to congregate and then right on up the food chain its up from the bottom its not long before i get my first bite oop i think somethings nibbling that grunts yep thats a piranha its a black piranha the black piranha is the largest of the piranha family growing up to a foot and a half long a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth has given piranhas a fearsome reputation and its well earned two years ago i found a story about a young boy who was devoured by piranhas in front of his grandparents speaking native language all they got in was bones wade its unlikely that piranhas would have killed all three cowboys*****************i know from experience that youve got to keep an open mind only eliminating a suspect after youve heard all the evidence which is why im meeting a witness tomorrow before i track him down ill see what other potential suspects are here it must be a predators paradise down there within minutes something else has grabbed my bait this feels much bigger than a black piranha gosh this is strong this is strong its rising up in the wa there it is oh its a ray its a ray look at the size of that this is the first spotted river ray ive ever caught ive come across stingrays before in thailand ive seen how they can seriously*****************people man screaming i want to take a closer look but im not sure how to safely haul it into the boat my worry with this fish is getting too close to it oh speaking foreign language conversing in foreign language its tail has a venomous spike inches long which could whip round and stab me as i pull it in wade taking it to shore and pulling it onto the bank is the best option on close inspection im reminded that this can kill as well that spine there very dangerous its just like a knife inches long that would go in your flesh very easily be very painful and actually if thats in the wrong part of*****************the brazilian rainforest but this area is unfamiliar to me and im not sure what to expect the whole area was cleared decades ago by ranchers and gold prospectors all the wild animals were chased out or killed making it safe for livestock and humans but it seems that a deadly water predator has managed to cling on the cowboys deaths are still raw in the minds of many and ive been refused access to where they died conversing in foreign language i meet the witness jesunaldo at a nearby farm instead okay speaking native language he tells me that it happened during the wet season when the pastures were flooded a mule had become stuck in the water jesunaldo and five other cowboys tried to rescue it what they had to do was actually sort of go in and just try and pull the animal out the first three*****************rays there would have been huge amounts of blood in the water which he didnt see jesunaldo has his own theory about the killers identity speaking native language hes given me the name of a terrifying new suspect for the cowboy killer its a creature ive heard about but never encountered now he says although he didnt actually see anything i mean hes pretty certain that you know this was electric eels that caused these three men to die i have a prime suspect a monster said to have mythical powers and one i always feared i might encounter now i have to try to catch one known locally as poraque the electric eel isnt actually an eel at all its a member of the knife fish family they can be found throughout the amazon and orinoco river basins they can grow to over feet long and deliver a charge*****************enough to light up a house but is this enough to shock a human being to death ive heard stories about electric eels killing people before but theyve never been proven ive also heard of murderers blaming electric eels to cover their misdeeds but could an eel really kill three people at one time i have my doubts there are many other animals in these waters that are documented killers such as anacondas and caimans victims of these predators bear the telltale marks of bites or strangulation clues that help identify the culprit a victim of electrocution would have no such marks my job now is to find out what state the cowboys corpses were in when they were*****************to do this jesunaldo has put me in contact with a man called hermes speaking foreign language he discovered the bodies the next day speaking native language he tells me that the grim search for the three bodies started where the cowboys disappeared speaking native language they actually got boats with motors in the water and they were driving those around to create a disturbance the wash from the propellers would churn up anything lying below the surface speaking native language there were no bite marks or anything like that on the bodies having no bites is in line with the prime suspect being an electric eel and hermes has one final revelation about the recovered bodies all three*****************their hands clenched and inside the hands were weed or grass from the bottom of the water clenched hands are a telltale clue wade when a person receives a large electric shock the bodys muscles begin to spasm which could explain why the cowboys died with their hands clenched this is all strong evidence that an electric eel might be responsible for the cowboys deaths but i wonder how much real proof im going to find electricity crackles ive got to catch one and see for myself what these fish are capable of normally i can see what im up against massive teeth cavernous mouths and tails that can fatally stab you the electric eels invisible powers make it*****************any fish ive gone after before im hoping to gain some local knowledge at the towns fish market the people here are those most likely to have come up against them everywhere i look are toothy dangerous fish but electric eels arent on the menu speaking native language fishermen dont fish for them and the reason they dont fish for them is that they say the shock is very powerful wade electric eels or poraque have been striking fear into peoples hearts since long before europeans arrived in the 16th century before electricity was understood brazils indigenous tupi people told of a warrior who carelessly dropped a lightning bolt on an eel giving the fish its mysterious power wade*****************reality its the eels specially adapted muscles that generate the large shocks but does this electricity kill somebody outright or do they drown after being paralyzed speaking foreign language when i tell people about my mission to catch one theyre in no doubt about what will happen to me one way or the other he says it will kill you no two ways about it - no - no dont mess with it basically dont mess with it when i said is it strong enough to kill he said yeah absolutely no doubt about it its looking like it could be a bit of a mission i would normally try to apprehend my suspect at the scene of the*****************but quite apart from the ranch owners sensitivities im here at the height of the dry season the water levels have dropped and the spot where the cowboys died is now just pasture all the fish are now concentrated in the remaining water in theory making them easier to find its possible that the monster could have moved into the nearest big river the araguaia one thing is playing on my mind since nobody fishes for electric eels i havent been able to get any advice on how to catch them ive been warned theyre elusive and tend to show up when least expected all i can realistically do is put a bait in the water and hope an*****************eel takes it before something else does the thing is theres loads of predators in these waters so you know ive got a bait on the bottom here but you know theres lots of other species that could pick it up you know theres no way really to single out the electric eel i know im doing the right thing to catch one but something else could beat it to the bait because i dont want to get a nasty shock when i catch an electric eel im taking some precautions the nylon line im using wont conduct electricity so ill be safe while bringing it in then once i get it to the boat i have a thick*****************of rubber boots and gloves which means ill be able to handle it without getting shocked my theory that the fish should be more concentrated here seems to be correct as something takes my bait within a matter of minutes whoa theres something on the end of my line and its putting up a powerful fight chuckles i dont think its an electric eel its too strong the back of an electric eels body is mostly used to produce electricity it doesnt have the muscle to put up a struggle like this ah yeah you see the bubbles come out thats a big red-tail catfish big red-tail catfish out of the water it gulps in air blowing it out*****************its gill flaps got it got it got it got it very strong fish but it tends to not have the stamina but i mean another thing to remark about this fish its about of the body is his head huge head chuckles look at this this river is just full of predators theres a big chunk of fin missing there i get the fish back in the water so it can recover before i let it go this proves my point what i was saying earlier on you throw a bit of dead fish in this river and theres anything that could take it you know could be an electric eel thats what i was hoping for but*****************know it could just as likely be one of these red-tail catfish that was a great catch but unfortunately its not the fish im after i need to find out more about electric eels anything about them which may help me catch one im meeting up with a fish expert from the university of para dr jonathan reddy he has a couple of specimens in a tank so i can get my first proper look at an electric eel these fish are using their electric capability all the time theyre constantly sending out little pulses smaller eels like these deliver a less-powerful shock than the larger ones but they can still pack a punch wearing protective rubber gloves jonathan*****************me this by hooking one up to a bank of leds electricity crackles it lights them up using muscles that have been modified into thousands of special cells which work in a similar way to aa batteries each individual cell generates around of a volt but when they all fire together a large pulse is produced it uses this high voltage to shock prey and for defense so this voltage is just for a very short while volts and the bigger eels theyre known to be up to volts maybe even above thats almost the same as the voltage produced by a heart defibrillator electric eels also generate a low-energy pulse of around volts which they use to survey*****************surroundings helping to compensate for their poor eyesight it can see even in muddy water by using its electroreceptors to detect distortions in its electrical field a pulse is emitted every few seconds and these can be picked up by placing electrodes in the water and amplifying the signal there you see a wave of signals as they try and work out whats going on popping so my finger in there wouldnt feel this - its only - you wouldnt feel this small orienting pulses are harmless but the bigger shocks are up to times more powerful and can travel through water when theyre about to stun something do you get much warning if theyre gonna do that -*****************do i hear a you will get some kind of warning but it might not be too much for you to react in time popping there you go no problems chuckles no shock this time im hoping this equipment will help me locate them in the wild wade electric eels are proving to be very elusive and large rivers have too many places to hide a farmer called milton knows the perfect place where electric eels could be trapped im going to fish in a small lake which got cut off when the water levels dropped at the start of the dry season its miles inland from the araguaia so he gives me and my boat a lift electric*****************come up for air every to minutes they get of their oxygen by absorbing it through blood vessels in the mouth if i pick up a signal and wait ill know im in the right position to spot one when it comes up to breathe now there was something just surfaced made some rings just by that bit of wood there which could have been an electric eel coming up for air im not hearing anything ive swept the entire lake with no success well this equipment worked very well in the tank but its not really picking up anything here that i can recognize as being definitely electric eel so i think im gonna return to doing what*****************know best and that is getting a line in the water next to the lake is a small pond milton tells me its full of a toothy fish called trahira which he says is good for bait he gives me a bamboo rod to catch them as the locals do most fishing youre being quite stealthy youre creeping up youre putting the bait in the water quietly trahira are very inquisitive they lie in shallow water and if they hear a sound rather than head in the opposite direction they actually come and investigate ah thats a trahira those teeth are probably almost as vicious as a piranhas its a bit gap-toothed but those teeth are very sharp thats*****************start towards getting some bait unlike electric eels trahira are proving incredibly easy to catch theyre also very slippery its like a bar of soap with teeth oh progress stops when my hook gets caught on an underwater branch im not prepared for what i find at the end of my snagged line oh oh oh oh bleep but its a case of mistaken identity its actually not an electric eel that is an eel wade this is a masoom it may look like a true eel but it is in fact another elongated fish for a moment there i was worried i saw this long snakelike thing on the line and i wasnt hanging around to have a*****************look i was out of the water if this was an electric eel this size that could be potentially fatal strange sort of admission to make im actually glad that wasnt the fish that i was after im not having much luck catching an electric eel its proving far harder to find than i expected but ive gotten word of another attack and im heading out to investigate it happened in on a farm near vila nova where a 21-year-old farm worker called francisco died in a small pond ive traveled there to meet up with his friend fernando the only witness to franciscos last moments speaking native language francisco had only been working at the farm for two*****************when he decided to go fishing in a nearby pond conversing in native language fernando warned him about the electric eels hed seen there but francisco carried on anyway they were fishing with a sort of basket you go in the water and you run this along the bottom of the pond and then you see if you got any fish in the basket speaking native language and he said you know they tried a couple of times hadnt caught anything fernando was staying on the bank he didnt want to get in the water on the third scoop of the basket francisco disappeared and so what he did he ran for help came back with two other people*****************when they got there there was no sign of anybody no sign of francisco they started searching for his body by dragging a wooden hoe through the water speaking foreign language eventually franciscos body rose to the surface with a macabre addition speaking native language the body of the eel was wrapped around the boys body only when it was pulled right into the shallows did it actually then disappear back into the water now fernandos saying that like me you know hed heard stories that this is a fish thats capable of killing people but he didnt really believe that hadnt heard anything very definite and so when he saw what actually did happen he said he almost*****************believe it ive never heard of a situation of someone being killed by a fish in such a small volume of water but the other thing that really struck me was that unlike the case of the three cowboys who were killed i mean here there was absolutely no doubt what animal was responsible there was a positive id you know this was an electric eel that killed francisco finally clear evidence of an electric eel causing a human death what i dont know though is whether victims drown after being shocked or die from electrocution ive tracked down dr evo panovich the pathologist who performed franciscos autopsy wade speaking foreign language speaking native language so i just asked*****************panovich a simple question is the electric eel capable of killing a human being and the answer a very clear yes he goes on to tell me exactly how francisco died speaking foreign language it sounds like it was actually really the heart was stopped so instead of actually contracting strongly to circulate the blood it had gone into some kind of fibrillation in that kind of situation you know drowning is almost secondary the immediate cause of the death was the electricity of the fish this is exactly the evidence ive been searching for theres only one thing left to do catch the culprit without ending up on dr evos slab the locals tell me electric eels lurk*****************im wearing my protective rubber boots and the rubber gloves are on standby in case i catch one ive just seen something surface ive also ditched my carbon-fiber rod in favor of a bamboo pole perfect for small ponds like this and with the added advantage that it wont conduct electricity its trahira whoops once again aggressive trahira are proving no problem to catch actually thought that might have been an electric eel because the take was not characteristic of trahira trahira makes a very sort of jagged quick take that was quite fiddly and the line going out slowly so i thought it might have been an electric eel but another trahira wade im becoming increasingly frustrated because*****************final question still lingers is one eel capable of killing three men horse whinnies little is known about electric-eel behavior so just seeing one in the wild never mind catching one might help me answer this last question i know now that this is an animal thats capable of killing people its got nothing to fear from other animals and at times it certainly seems to be pretty bold but you know where are they i think you know ive got to give this some real serious thought about what i do now if im actually to succeed in catching one of these things the electric eels elusiveness isnt the only thing going against me thunder crashes it was*****************a night like this when according to tupi legend the ancestral electric eel received its heaven-sent powers when a lightning bolt was dropped on it but the rain thats falling for the first time in months is about to make my job much harder soon the eels will no longer be concentrated in the shallow dry-season ponds thunder rumbles i was getting close but with this you know it could mean that my window of opportunity is rapidly closing it could actually be too late this could ruin it this could mean that i actually dont find my electric eel the water is rising and all the small ponds and waterways are starting to link up again allowing the*****************to disperse this makes an already elusive creature nearly impossible to find my best option is to travel east to where the rains havent yet hit i fish as i go but im still catching everything but an electric eel this is a thing called a fidalgo its a type of catfish not an electric eel my last hope is an area just southwest of maraba where its still tinder dry and fires are burning everywhere the water here is at its absolute lowest and at daybreak ill have the best chance im going to get before the rains sweep in after asking around i get a promising lead about a tiny pool right in the middle of cattle*****************conversing in foreign language its more like a mud puddle the last place id expect to find a river monster speaking foreign language finally after days of searching a giant electric eel is right in front of me that looked like just one of these branches one of these roots that is an electric eel its a big one now ive got to work up the nerve to catch it im just making a bit of a trench from my point of view itll be easier to handle if theres some kind of sort of notch that its in rather than its being able to slip and slide all over the place my normal capture method would be useless*****************water this shallow so out goes the rod and in comes a lasso fitting for cowboy country because electric eels dont rely on physical strength pulling it out of the water shouldnt be that hard but not getting shocked will be so protective clothing is essential weve got a plan the plan is not so much to sort of go after the head with the noose but to position that and then get it to go through the noose just taking a few deep breaths because one slip and you know it could be very nasty indeed need to be so focused and so careful about this an eel this size can deliver a shock of volts thats enough*****************stop my heart in seconds first go amazing first go electric eels can keep on shocking out of water but the rubber gloves were wearing protect us from this look at the colors on this thing these are i got to get it clean that is its doing - it looks like a muscle contraction spasm almost and thats when its actually shocking wade because electric eels get most of their oxygen from breathing air they can stay out of water for long periods of time thats thats pretty much exactly the same as me this is exactly the same size as the eel that killed francisco the 21-year-old man who died in a tiny pond near vila nova*****************if i wasnt wearing these rubber gloves i could be dead too its over degrees and i dont want the fish to overheat so time it went back in the water whoa the pond may be shallow at the moment but the rains are not far behind me the waters will soon rise giving this eel the freedom to roam once again my search led me to this tiny drying-out puddle i mean the water in there is barely inches deep its the last place youd expect to find a river monster but thats where it was man speaking native language theres more theres more theres more its not just this big one theres again it looks like wood*****************its started moving were watching it and it looks like theres actually several but smaller right in with these roots here ive just never seen anything like this before its like a tangle of bodies im just trying to count the heads the more i look the more i see i was thinking or a dozen i think there could be down here this is an incredible discovery and answers the final question about how the cowboys died wade i believe a group of electric eels like this was trapped in a pool over the dry season when the rains came the water levels got higher until the eels could all leave into the swelling waterways it was in,electrophorus electricus is the best-known species of electric eel it is a south american electric fish until the discovery of two additional species in the genus was classified as the monotypic with this species the only one in the genus3 despite the name it is not an eel but rather a knifefish4 it is considered as a freshwater teleost which contains an electrogenic tissue that produces electric discharges5 taxonomic history the species has been reclassified several times when originally described by carl linnaeus in he used the name gymnotus electricus placing it in the same genus as gymnotus carapo banded knifefish which he had described several years earlier it was only about a century later in that the electric eel was moved to its own genus electrophorus by theodore gill6 in september david de santana et al suggested the division of the genus into three species based on dna divergence*****************and habitat anatomy and physiology and electrical ability e electricus e voltai sp nov and e varii sp nov the study found e electricus to be the sister

chamber is connected to the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the weberian apparatus which greatly enhances its hearing capability the posterior chamber extends

obligate air-breathers e electricus must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way9 physiology further information electric eel electrophysiology e electricus*****************three pairs of abdominal organs that produce electricity the main organ hunters organ and sachs organ these organs occupy a large part of its body and give the electric eel the ability to generate two types of electric organ discharges low voltage and high voltage these organs are made of electrocytes

been prominent in the study of bioelectricity since the 18th century18 the species is of some interest to researchers who make use of its acetylcholinesterase and adenosine triphosphate1920 despite being the first described species in the genus and thus the most famous example e electricus actually has the weakest maximum voltage of the three species in the genus at only volts as opposed to volts in e varii and volts in e voltai3 ecology and life history electric eel at the new england aquarium habitat e electricus is restricted to freshwater habitats in the guiana

flesh ripper,new zealand longfin eel,anguilla dieffenbachii,my names jeremy wade for years ive chased dangerous fish up some of the wildest rivers on the planet tracking down the facts that lie behind legends im fascinated by the real-life monsters that sometimes eat us and which feed on nightmares but as a biologist i want to know the truth now im back on the hunt lured by the riddle of an 8-foot flesh-eater thats said to devour humans if im right this alleged killer is born deep in the ocean yet transforms itself into a freshwater predator the fish im after has a grip like a vise and it stands accused of terrifying attacks screams wade imagine a land mass cut off from the rest of the world for million years a wilderness of impenetrable forests and lakes almost twice as deep as loch ness now suppose that in the cold dark waters of this lost world lurks a predator big enough to kill a man this was virtually the last place on earth to be discovered when the maori came here barely years ago there was one animal they revered above all others ive always thought of new zealand as a totally safe place to get in the water but just recently two separate reports have caught my eye and made me think again one incident concerns a young man clint haines who was out on a remote lake in new zealands south island according to this newspaper report haines had gone out to recover a friends boat propeller from the bottom of the lake he knew the lake well or at least he thought he did at about feet down something massive suddenly swam towards him and within seconds there were more of them he says up to about pounds in size in the pitch black one of these creatures sank its jaws into one of clints fins and started to drag him down wade panicking he dropped his flashlight and swam for his life screaming clints wife bev remembers how this aggressive pack actually pursued him to the surface where clint was screaming to get out hed come up so fast from deep water that he collapsed with the bends haines survived the attack but was plagued by nightmares wade for ian sutherland another diver working in northern new zealand a similar encounter proved to be more violent the creature in this case was already a local legend its head was reportedly a foot across without warning it rammed ian in the chest with enough force to crack one of his ribs by all accounts the animals that grabbed and thumped these two divers were supersized eels now ive heard about monstrous sea-dwelling eels some like this european conger can grow to feet long and the giant moray is a seriously large animal certainly big enough to attack humans one well-known account here of a diver getting his thumb ripped off and eaten but the idea that a freshwater eel could ever be huge or dangerous comes as a real surprise wade new zealand in fact has three kinds of freshwater eel the speckled eel grows to around feet long but its off my suspect list because it doesnt live in the lake where haines was attacked at little more than feet long the shortfin eel is simply too small to fit the bill the most likely perpetrator is the longfin an eel thats unique to new zealand and which is known to grow to at least feet modern records have this snakelike fish growing to around pounds but there are older anecdotal reports of much larger specimens in the 19th century the naturalist thomas potts mentions a 90-pounder landed from a place called stonyhurst and theres even a story of a 130-pound eel taken from a deep lake in new zealands south island such an eel if it ever existed must have looked like an underwater python wade these accounts are certainly intriguing but buried in the archives of londons maritime museum is an even more tantalizing description of a creature thats not only a monster but also a man-eater some years ago british explorer james cook painstakingly mapped the coastline of new zealand as he did so he gathered information from the maori inhabitants about native wildlife and in one of his many journals he alludes very specifically to a man-eating monster following a conversation with the local chief cook writes and i quote we had another piece of information importing that there are here snakes and lizards of an enormous size feet long and equal to a mans body in circumference they sometimes seize and devour men according to cook the chief actually drew a picture of one of these creatures to show what he meant but the obvious conclusion that this beast must be a python or possibly some kind of huge lizard simply cant be right what makes this account so intriguing and also so problematic is that there are no snakes or any large reptiles in new zealand and there never have been wade as i head for new zealand my prime suspect for captain cooks devourer of men is not a snake but a fish that looks like a snake its a theory that seems more plausible when you consider maori folklore maori legends are full of tales about predatory beasts called taniwha now these potentially very dangerous creatures are quite slippery customers and sometimes they take the form of a giant eel wade im starting my search for a giant longfin at a place called mangawhitikau near waitomo on new zealands north island supposedly there are eels that have lived in this cave for at least years and have never seen daylight more disconcertingly the maori name for this underworld means bad place to cross the river eels are at the heart of maori culture legend has it that they all sprang from a single huge ancestor the story goes that there was a drought up in heaven and a giant eel was sent down to earth to try and find water for the gods but while it was here it tried to seduce the wife of maui who was the most powerful of the maori gods and enraged maui fought with the giant eel and hacked it in two and the severed head gave rise to all the seawater eels and the tail so the story goes gave rise to all the freshwater eels wade even with a flashlight and a head lamp im straining to see more than a few feet ive no idea what might be lurking here but to tempt something out of the shadows i decide to dip a piece of meat into the water straightaway an eel emerges this one isnt huge but it is surprisingly bold despite living in pitch black it has absolutely no fear of the light or of me its on a single-minded search for flesh yet this carnivorous instinct doesnt on its own make the longfin a killer i want to find out if they can get big enough and aggressive enough to be seriously dangerous to people could they ever be in the words of cook devourers of men to get a proper look at what makes the longfin eel new zealands top freshwater predator i first have to catch one when it comes to bait anything goes fresh roadkill could be worth a try eels tend to be more active at night relying on smell rather than sight to find food i use a concoction of guts and offal to draw them in eels have a phenomenal ability to sense blood my two rods are each equipped with an electronic alarm primed to go off if something makes a grab for the bait beeping i dont have to wait long if theres flesh on offer it seems these animals are into it like starved piranhas wade even with a small one i have to take special care because these fish have poisonous blood the serum contains a neurotoxin that can kill dogs and just a splash into my eye or a cut as i try to unhook it could land me in serious trouble doesnt feel like a normal fish at all very very smooth skin they do actually have scales but theyre embedded under her layer of skin not very big eyes they dont really use their eyes to hunt but they do use smell and you can see what looks like a pair of horns on the front of the head there in fact these structures are tubes that funnel water into enlarged nasal chambers the eels sense of smell is even more sensitive than that of a great white shark having zeroed in an eel grabs its prey with powerful jaws that bristle with hundreds of teeth you can see why people consider these to be very similar to snakes even though they are technically fish there are plenty of eels here but nothing over feet long leaving legends aside i wonder if science can shed any light on the question of size just how big in theory could this animal grow wade inside the skull of a dead eel may seem like a strange place to look for an answer but dr don jellyman is the world authority in these animals and he knows exactly what hes after so this is the brain the spinal cord and this little item that sits in a small sac just in the back here and is part of the balancing system so thats what were after jeremy that little bone here holds the key to a lot of the life history of the eel its age its growth rate once magnified this tiny ear bone reveals the growth history of the fish so is that the same sort of principle as counting the rings on a tree something like that it is its exactly the same a 2-to 3-foot eel can be years old but amazingly this is just a youngster whats the oldest they might be do you think any conjectures well the oldest that ive aged is years old and from that lake the average age at which the females migrated was years its extraordinary isnt it one thing ive been thinking about is this mention in captain cooks journals about he was told about something that was snakelike and feet long would one of these be capable of growing to feet do you think in ideal conditions its quite likely in the wild that they would have grown to a very very large size like that so that could be a reliable report and at that length how much is that gonna weigh roughly well over pounds at that stage yeah yeah gosh - thats a big fish - yeah its a seriously big fish so that captain cook report it could have been one of these it could well have been it might be of interest just to have a look inside it so well just do a run up through here so ooh there is something in here - thats the stomach there - thats quite full isnt it lets take a peek im rather interested to know what this has got in it with toxic blood oozing out of the eels body im careful to wash my hands um so aha is that another eel its another eel yes its well-digested yeah yeah yeah yeah so they can be quite cannibalistic theyre just well-adapted to taking those opportunities as they arise if theres tucker there theyre into it yeah wade my photo fit of captain cooks monster is starting to take shape its a fish with real nerve guided by the nose of a bloodhound and armed with hundreds of close-packed teeth it can live for more than a century and potentially at least grow to feet long it also happens to have toxic blood and a taste for its own kind but is it truly dangerous to find out ive booked myself onto a popular radio chat show man radio southland fm im talking with well-known angler jeremy wade whos really interested in hearing your stories about longfin eels so give us a call on im looking for evidence of aggression and the lines are soon buzzing man an eel came and latched on to the deer carcass and we had a wrestling match for that man she latched on to my finger man when i looked down i had quite a surprise quite a large black eel man it would have to have been you know meters and as round as a mans thigh man my finger and then stripped back to the bone man there are some monsters theres no question of that i was prepared for tales of ducklings swallowed whole but it seems that some eels strike at much larger prey woman yeah i took my dog sam down to the river and we were playing with a ball i was throwing it and he was bringing it back to me and i threw it this one time and i heard him go in for it i could hear something going on but i couldnt see him ducklings chirping he just disappeared under the water wade im still taking note when a man calls in to tell me about some sheep that were eaten alive sheep bleating then to top it all the story of a man who went skinny dipping wade right i get your drift so this chap who was hospitalized was he missing anything when he got out of hospital chuckling okay wade my respect for these longfins is growing by the minute so ill definitely take care when im out there trying to get my own hands-on experience man beware just be careful eel wrestling is not a good sport for tourists okay thanks for the warning stick to bungee jumping wade going on the radio has really helped me to tap into local knowledge and very quickly get an accurate sense of what this predator is capable of but since coming here ive also tracked down an old newspaper report that describes a terrifying assault on a young girl this appears to be a very clear example of an eel deliberately trying to kill a human wade in 8-year-old carol davis wandered into a stream on her fathers property for several days previously large eels had been attacking mr daviss ducks then for reasons that arent clear one of them decided to have a go at carol screaming the idea that an eel could drag a girl into deep water is entirely possible this is a fish that can actually swim backwards with real power carols horror story has really concentrated my mind not only was she attacked in shallow water her ordeal also happened in broad daylight it makes me wonder what would happen to me under similar conditions its not just dark underground caves where you find eels lurking im in a wildlife park where i know there are half a dozen big longfins im not yet ready to try this out in the wild where if things went wrong id be miles from any help nonetheless theres no such thing as a tame eel and ive already heard enough to put me on edge their mouths are lined with hundreds of backward-pointing teeth and the ones in here are certainly big enough to grab an ankle or a hand aah im treading in sort of roots here the trouble is theyre gonna be lurking right in there i dont want to get my toes nipped after a couple of nervy encounters i decide to push my luck ive actually got one right here there we go whew short and dramatic thats my first real contact with one of these big longfin eels clearly well-fed eels like these just arent aggressive but im not fooling myself theyll be so placid in the wild in new zealands south island i leave the beaten track and push into the mountains some of the biggest eels mentioned in historical records were caught from deep lakes in the interior and this is where im focusing my search for a monster wade on lake manapouri in what feels like the middle of nowhere i first join evan brunton a man who tracks and catches eels for a living there are parts of this lake that plunge to more than a quarter of a mile deep room enough for a monster to hide in even today wade so weve actually got over feet in the middle i mean thats way deeper than loch ness brunton feets nothing for an eel the other night we were tracking eels at in the morning and one eel was traveling right on the surface and the other eel was traveling at meters which is feet an eel could quite happily live at the bottom of this lake and do you think there are still big ones around yes there is a few big ones from time to time just seem to turn up out of the blue evan calculates that some of the eels in this lake are over years old when you think about it some of these eels were years old at the outbreak of the second world war have you heard any stories of aggressive or dangerous eels in your time a couple of people went missing in the hidden lakes of tianya supposedly taken by monstrous eels youve only got to see the strength in them when they fight itd be very very hard for some people to actually get up again especially if there was more than one of them people can fall over and knock themselves out cant they wade at a secluded bay we pull over to see if anything large has turned up in evans nets even here the chances of finding a giant eel are slim but the 16-pounder that evan hauls out is still an impressive animal so powerful you can imagine that a 30-pound could drag someone away theres some eels up in the speaks indistinctly that have been up to pound and theyve been caught and reliably weighed - yes they have - gosh wade evans accounts of monstrous 100-pound eels have got me itching to fish but first theres a niggling question at the back of my mind i can well believe that a massive eel could seize someone and drag them under but with teeth designed to grip rather than cut im skeptical about whether it could actually dismember and devour a person if captain cooks man-eater really is a huge longfin then this animal must have some other way to rip you apart to see how im laying on a buffet a hunter has provided me with a deer carcass and ive brought along a high-tech box of tricks underwater cameras placed around the bait will give me separate views of the tail throat and stomach if any eels show up to feed ill be able to see how they deal with something thats too large to swallow whole the eels ive seen got very powerful bodies and a very strong grip but how one of these animals even if it was the 8-foot size mentioned in captain cooks journal how that could devour a person is still not immediately obvious with my surveillance cameras switched on i retreat to a makeshift control room the stage is set all i can do now is sit and wait for nearly two hours nothing shows up if eels are sensitive to electricity then it could be that my cameras are spooking them or perhaps theyre just biding their time until dark suddenly they appear out of nowhere and like a pack of wolves they start to attack the carcass straining to see in the pitch black i catch my first glimpse of how these predators could rip you to shreds here we go its getting in there yep its latching on its actually spinning its spinning around these eels are feeding like crocodiles gripping the victim firmly then spinning violently to twist off chunks of flesh it actually reminds me of this story that ive heard its one of those stories that i havent been able to pin down where it happened who to but a few people have told me this somebody who was driving supposedly had a few to drink hard rock music playing wade its said that the man swerved out of control and crashed into a lake tires screech unconscious and bleeding he would have been quite literally a sitting target for marauding eels ive now seen with my own eyes how a pack of longfins could make a real mess of someone given half a chance ive also tracked down credible stories of massive eels living in new zealands remote backwaters yet just when im ready to try and catch one of these slippery monsters i run into an unexpected problem in wilderness areas like this fishing for eels with hooks is now strictly forbidden ive no choice but to give up my usual methods and start from scratch eel fisherman vic thompson is my teacher im gonna make a bob for you simply find a bit of steak like that or a bit of any red meat and cut it into a slim slice and ive got a bit of mackerel fish here which adds a bit of flavor you have a bit of wool just ordinary darning wool needle thread through like that to start with pull it right through and then you just wind this around like that after youve done the first layer like that youve got to put a loop on here to attach it to your line the theory is simple when the eel bites its teeth get tangled in the wool i must then drag it ashore before it shakes itself free so there youve got your loop on your bob good bite size for an eel i guess the angler doesnt have the eel actually has the hook in this situation the eel has a lot of hooks in its mouth so they hook onto the wool very low-tech but very effective by the sound of it very effective wade it all sounds straightforward but as i head for a deserted spot in a deep water lake im not so sure the method ive just learned is a traditional maori technique known as toy or bobbing one clear benefit at least is that with no hooks involved theres little danger of spilling the eels toxic blood assuming i can catch one having cast my very first hookless bait i wait for a bite if anywhere has supersized eels still prowling the depths it has to be a place like this without a hook though im in virgin territory it feels like ive been disarmed beeping its still in the mouth its still in its mouth look at that just came out oop come here there we go my first fish on a bob the technique actually works and it works for two reasons bit of role reversal here normally its me providing the hook this eel has got hundreds of little hooks in its mouth in the form of teeth and thats why it catches onto that bob it sort of hooks in the other thing is its a predator and so it thinks that bait is getting away so it hangs on and if im quick about it its up on the bank before it actually knows whats going on okay ooh so im putting you back no need to struggle im actually putting you back lovely ive just caught a fish without using a hook it absolutely works wade spurred on by my success i push further into even wilder backwaters to places where few people ever fish the eels here are as bold and as willing to strike as any ive seen and with my bobbing skills improving fast im soon dragging them out at up to feet long but im looking for a beast twice this size and time is running out if the animal described by captain cook really was an eel then seemingly the big ones are very rare or even perhaps a thing of the past so far the monster ive come in search of has eluded me but i still have some unfinished business with the longfin eel that may yet help me solve the mystery just in my short time here ive been hearing a lot about their aggression im in no doubt that im dealing with a very powerful and large animal there were those sheep dragged into the water and eaten alive and that was actually from somebody who saw that happening sheep bleating as for humans we have a swimmer who was swimming without clothes who had his private parts mauled and then there was the diver having his ribs actually cracked and then finally that newspaper report of a girl being dragged into the water girl screaming but i have to admit there is still a grain of doubt in my mind to be totally convinced i need to see the proof for myself and theres only one way that i can do that wade my destination is a remote river in the heart of a primeval wilderness i want to find out if wild longfin eels large or small are willing to attack a healthy adult human ive already been in the water with these animals in a zoo this time its going to be very different the place ive chosen is swarming with eels and because theyre wild theyll be hungry the question is will they be bold enough to have a crack at me to draw them in i first soak my clothes with fish guts put simply im turning myself into human bait ahh i feel my heart starting to pound ive done some crazy things in my time getting into a pool with piranhas going into murky water after snakeheads but this has to be one of the scariest things ive done for protection im wearing chain mail gloves and a thick wet suit and ill be sticking close to the bank within minutes eels start to emerge from their hiding holes the question is are any eels going to bite that is just so snakelike coming out of the water with its mouth like that im hoping theyre going for my hands but they seem to be interested in other parts of my clothing which is a bit disconcerting and even if i move if i move my legs i move my hands its not really sending them away at all theyre coming right in close the thing about these fish these are not fish that people feed these are wild fish so they are hungry theyre bumping my legs theyre tugging at my shirt and theyre coming in on my fingers as well im actually wearing gloves these are kevlar gloves and i wouldnt be too happy doing it without those ah i do want to hold my ground i mean ive come this far i dont want to get out too too quickly wade its broad daylight and from their point of view im a big animal but theyre totally unfazed get out no ill need kevlar underpants as well most fish would not do this at all even piranhas ow that was inside of the thigh inside of the thigh what i dont want is for them to draw blood if they draw blood that could really get them going ah ah that is one aggressive fish ah look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that ah i think its time for me to get out get out get out wade i came here wondering if the monster described so long ago by captain cook was in fact a giant eel short of seeing an 8-footer i cant be sure yet its clear to me that without protective clothing these eels would have ripped into my flesh and tried to eat me alive and with this animal it isnt just about size slip and fall over in some lonely river and its the hungry pack that could seal your fate,the new zealand longfin eel anguilla dieffenbachii is a species of freshwater eel that is endemic to new zealand it is the largest freshwater eel in new zealand and the only endemic species the other eels found in new zealand are the native shortfin eel anguilla australis also found in australia and the naturally introduced australian longfin eel anguilla reinhardtii longfin eels are long-lived migrating to the pacific ocean near tonga to breed at the end of their lives they are good climbers as juveniles and so are found in streams and lakes a long way inland an important traditional food source for maori who name them orea longfin eel numbers are declining and they are classified as endangered but over one hundred tonnes are still commercially fished each year description the easiest way to identify the longfin eel is by the length of its fins the dorsal top fin is about two-thirds the length of the body and starts significantly further towards the head than the anal bottom fin in the shortfin eel the fins are of similar length when a longfin eel bends its loose skin wrinkles distinctively inside each bend where a shortfin eels skin is smooth a longfins mouth extends past its eyes further than a shortfins female longfin eels are larger and longer-lived than males males average cm but reach up to cm in length with an average age of years years females are considerably larger ranging from cm with an average length of cm females attain an age of to years before migrating to sea to breed longfin eels in the north island migrate at a younger age and thus have faster generation times determining longfin sex is difficult as their sexual organs are not determined until they are over cm in length the only method to determine longfin eels sex is through internal examination and only becomes easy to distinguish when the eels mature and migrate life cycle like other members of the anguillidae longfin eels have a rather unusual life cycle they grow and mature into fertile adults in fresh water then migrate to the sea to breed this catadromous breeding system also ensures randomised mating creating a panmictic population the new zealand longfin eel is a very long-lived fish with records of females reaching years old and weighing up to kg they have the slowest growth rate of any eel species studied just centimetres a year longfin eels life cycle like other species of anguillidae eels is rather complex consisting of four distinct life stages which remained a mystery for many decades and still is not fully understood new zealand longfins breed only once at the end of their lives making a journey of thousands of kilometres from new zealand to their spawning grounds near tonga their eggs of which each female eel produces between and million are fertilized in an unknown manner but probably in deep tropical water the mature eels then die their eggs floating to the surface to hatch into very flat leaf-like larvae called leptocephalus that then drift along large oceanic currents back to new zealand this drifting is thought to take up to months there have been no recorded captures of either the eggs or larvae of longfin eels upon arriving in new zealand the larvae undergo a transformation metamorphosis into glass eels like small transparent adult eels these occupy estuaries for their first year during which they develop colouration and become elvers which resemble small adult longfin eels the elvers migrate upstream where they develop into adults the recruitment of glass eels into new zealands freshwater river networks is a very variable process thought to be affected by the el nino and la nina southern oscillations this is a major reason for the failure of longfin eel aquaculture in the 1970s diet longfin eels have an omnivorous diet and are opportunistic feeders their diet as small eels largely consists of insect larvae such as dragonfly nymphs procordulia grayi as the eels grow they also feed heavily on lymnaea snails and fish including galaxiids the upland bully and yearling trout which are taken by larger eels there are reports of these eels eating small waterfowl such as ducklings habitat and distribution anguilla dieffenbachii is endemic species to new zealand widely distributed through the countrys lakes and rivers including the chatham islands longfin eels are often found great distances inland up to km along fresh waterways and in high country lakes which are connected to the sea aiding in their inland distribution is their climbing ability in elver juvenile stage under cm in length these migration events frequently coincide with increased temperate water flow and low light conditions at this size the elvers can travel up to km inland over a summer and have been observed climbing near-vertical surfaces up to m tall this feat is accomplished through a combination of surface tension with the water and friction where in a waterway longfin eels live depends on their life stage as juveniles they prefer shallow water under m deep with coarse substratum and faster than average stream flow such as that found in riffles adult longfin eels tend to be found next to or under large pieces of debris and undercut river banks significance for maori orea are an important traditional food source for maori who have long had extensive knowledge of the timing of their upstream and downstream migrations commercial fishing the commercial fishing of longfin eels began to gain momentum in the 1960s and by the 1970s there was a tonne yearly catch the fishery went into decline in the early 1980s and in the fishing season only tonnes were taken commercial longfin eel fishing was included in the quota management system qms in for the south island and for the north island this set limits to the minimum and maximum size grams and kg and the total allowable catch tac as of the tac has not been reached in any fishing season since the implementation of the qms in recognition of the traditional significance of longfin eels maori have a percent allocation of fishery stocks the capture and export of glass eels in new zealand has been prohibited as of up to tonnes of eels including longfin eels were still being caught for export despite the species being officially classified as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species aquaculture there have been a number of attempts at aquaculture of longfin eels the first were in the 1970s and did not remain operational for long with the last farm closing in the most common reasons for these failures were economic the high cost of production vs low price for the eels variable recruitment of glass eels and the high mortality death rates in the farms since the early 2000s there has been renewed interest in the aquaculture of longfins due to the increasing knowledge of their biology and the diminishing stocks of european eels anguilla anguilla but no farms have been built conservation in biologist don jellyman predicted longfin numbers would drop by between and in the following decade the species was classified in and again in by the department of conservation as at risk declining under criteria c21 total area of occupancy ha km2 predicted decline the doc panel concluded though that the commercial fishery of the species is stable or increasing and noted that public discourse on the longfin eel portrays the species as being severely threatened despite data that indicate otherwise this conclusion has been seriously questioned repeatedly both before and since then throwing its validity into doubt in june it was reported that some pet food companies use the nationally threatened eels in their products sparking outrage by conservationists scientists and conservation groups have growing concern for the survival of the species as they can be legally killed and have a slow reproduction rate breeding only once at the end of their lifetime the iucn assessment noted a sharp decline in longfin numbers over the last century accompanied by significant reduction of habitat the iucn currently classes the species as endangered making the following notes population severely fragmented continued reduction in mature individuals continuing decline in areaextent andor quality of habitat despite this the new zealand government continues to allow its export and allows legal recreational killing of the fish references external

wildest rivers on the planet tracking down the facts that lie behind legends im fascinated by the real-life monsters that sometimes eat us and which feed on nightmares but as a biologist i want to know the truth now im back on the hunt lured by the riddle of an 8-foot flesh-eater thats said to devour humans if im right this alleged killer is born deep in the ocean yet transforms itself into a freshwater predator the fish im after has a grip like a vise and it stands accused of terrifying attacks screams wade imagine a land mass cut off from the rest of the world for million years a wilderness of impenetrable forests and lakes almost twice as deep as loch ness now suppose that in the cold dark waters of this lost world*****************a predator big enough to kill a man this was virtually the last place on earth to be discovered when the maori came here barely years ago there was one animal they revered above all others ive always thought of new zealand as a totally safe place to get in the water but just recently two separate reports have caught my eye and made me think again one incident concerns a young man clint haines who was out on a remote lake in new zealands south island according to this newspaper report haines had gone out to recover a friends boat propeller from the bottom of the lake he knew the lake well or at least he thought he*****************at about feet down something massive suddenly swam towards him and within seconds there were more of them he says up to about pounds in size in the pitch black one of these creatures sank its jaws into one of clints fins and started to drag him down wade panicking he dropped his flashlight and swam for his life screaming clints wife bev remembers how this aggressive pack actually pursued him to the surface where clint was screaming to get out hed come up so fast from deep water that he collapsed with the bends haines survived the attack but was plagued by nightmares wade for ian sutherland another diver working in northern new zealand a similar encounter proved*****************be more violent the creature in this case was already a local legend its head was reportedly a foot across without warning it rammed ian in the chest with enough force to crack one of his ribs by all accounts the animals that grabbed and thumped these two divers were supersized eels now ive heard about monstrous sea-dwelling eels some like this european conger can grow to feet long and the giant moray is a seriously large animal certainly big enough to attack humans one well-known account here of a diver getting his thumb ripped off and eaten but the idea that a freshwater eel could ever be huge or dangerous comes as a real surprise wade new zealand*****************fact has three kinds of freshwater eel the speckled eel grows to around feet long but its off my suspect list because it doesnt live in the lake where haines was attacked at little more than feet long the shortfin eel is simply too small to fit the bill the most likely perpetrator is the longfin an eel thats unique to new zealand and which is known to grow to at least feet modern records have this snakelike fish growing to around pounds but there are older anecdotal reports of much larger specimens in the 19th century the naturalist thomas potts mentions a 90-pounder landed from a place called stonyhurst and theres even a story of a 130-pound eel*****************from a deep lake in new zealands south island such an eel if it ever existed must have looked like an underwater python wade these accounts are certainly intriguing but buried in the archives of londons maritime museum is an even more tantalizing description of a creature thats not only a monster but also a man-eater some years ago british explorer james cook painstakingly mapped the coastline of new zealand as he did so he gathered information from the maori inhabitants about native wildlife and in one of his many journals he alludes very specifically to a man-eating monster following a conversation with the local chief cook writes and i quote we had another piece of information importing that*****************are here snakes and lizards of an enormous size feet long and equal to a mans body in circumference they sometimes seize and devour men according to cook the chief actually drew a picture of one of these creatures to show what he meant but the obvious conclusion that this beast must be a python or possibly some kind of huge lizard simply cant be right what makes this account so intriguing and also so problematic is that there are no snakes or any large reptiles in new zealand and there never have been wade as i head for new zealand my prime suspect for captain cooks devourer of men is not a snake but a fish that looks*****************a snake its a theory that seems more plausible when you consider maori folklore maori legends are full of tales about predatory beasts called taniwha now these potentially very dangerous creatures are quite slippery customers and sometimes they take the form of a giant eel wade im starting my search for a giant longfin at a place called mangawhitikau near waitomo on new zealands north island supposedly there are eels that have lived in this cave for at least years and have never seen daylight more disconcertingly the maori name for this underworld means bad place to cross the river eels are at the heart of maori culture legend has it that they all sprang from a single huge*****************the story goes that there was a drought up in heaven and a giant eel was sent down to earth to try and find water for the gods but while it was here it tried to seduce the wife of maui who was the most powerful of the maori gods and enraged maui fought with the giant eel and hacked it in two and the severed head gave rise to all the seawater eels and the tail so the story goes gave rise to all the freshwater eels wade even with a flashlight and a head lamp im straining to see more than a few feet ive no idea what might be lurking here but to tempt something out*****************the shadows i decide to dip a piece of meat into the water straightaway an eel emerges this one isnt huge but it is surprisingly bold despite living in pitch black it has absolutely no fear of the light or of me its on a single-minded search for flesh yet this carnivorous instinct doesnt on its own make the longfin a killer i want to find out if they can get big enough and aggressive enough to be seriously dangerous to people could they ever be in the words of cook devourers of men to get a proper look at what makes the longfin eel new zealands top freshwater predator i first have to catch one when it comes*****************bait anything goes fresh roadkill could be worth a try eels tend to be more active at night relying on smell rather than sight to find food i use a concoction of guts and offal to draw them in eels have a phenomenal ability to sense blood my two rods are each equipped with an electronic alarm primed to go off if something makes a grab for the bait beeping i dont have to wait long if theres flesh on offer it seems these animals are into it like starved piranhas wade even with a small one i have to take special care because these fish have poisonous blood the serum contains a neurotoxin that can kill dogs and*****************a splash into my eye or a cut as i try to unhook it could land me in serious trouble doesnt feel like a normal fish at all very very smooth skin they do actually have scales but theyre embedded under her layer of skin not very big eyes they dont really use their eyes to hunt but they do use smell and you can see what looks like a pair of horns on the front of the head there in fact these structures are tubes that funnel water into enlarged nasal chambers the eels sense of smell is even more sensitive than that of a great white shark having zeroed in an eel grabs its prey with powerful*****************that bristle with hundreds of teeth you can see why people consider these to be very similar to snakes even though they are technically fish there are plenty of eels here but nothing over feet long leaving legends aside i wonder if science can shed any light on the question of size just how big in theory could this animal grow wade inside the skull of a dead eel may seem like a strange place to look for an answer but dr don jellyman is the world authority in these animals and he knows exactly what hes after so this is the brain the spinal cord and this little item that sits in a small sac just in the*****************here and is part of the balancing system so thats what were after jeremy that little bone here holds the key to a lot of the life history of the eel its age its growth rate once magnified this tiny ear bone reveals the growth history of the fish so is that the same sort of principle as counting the rings on a tree something like that it is its exactly the same a 2-to 3-foot eel can be years old but amazingly this is just a youngster whats the oldest they might be do you think any conjectures well the oldest that ive aged is years old and from that lake the average age at which the females*****************was years its extraordinary isnt it one thing ive been thinking about is this mention in captain cooks journals about he was told about something that was snakelike and feet long would one of these be capable of growing to feet do you think in ideal conditions its quite likely in the wild that they would have grown to a very very large size like that so that could be a reliable report and at that length how much is that gonna weigh roughly well over pounds at that stage yeah yeah gosh - thats a big fish - yeah its a seriously big fish so that captain cook report it could have been one of these it could*****************have been it might be of interest just to have a look inside it so well just do a run up through here so ooh there is something in here - thats the stomach there - thats quite full isnt it lets take a peek im rather interested to know what this has got in it with toxic blood oozing out of the eels body im careful to wash my hands um so aha is that another eel its another eel yes its well-digested yeah yeah yeah yeah so they can be quite cannibalistic theyre just well-adapted to taking those opportunities as they arise if theres tucker there theyre into it yeah wade my photo fit of captain cooks*****************is starting to take shape its a fish with real nerve guided by the nose of a bloodhound and armed with hundreds of close-packed teeth it can live for more than a century and potentially at least grow to feet long it also happens to have toxic blood and a taste for its own kind but is it truly dangerous to find out ive booked myself onto a popular radio chat show man radio southland fm im talking with well-known angler jeremy wade whos really interested in hearing your stories about longfin eels so give us a call on im looking for evidence of aggression and the lines are soon buzzing man an eel came and latched on to*****************of hospital chuckling okay wade my respect for these longfins is growing by the minute so ill definitely take care when im out there trying to get my own hands-on experience man beware just be careful eel wrestling is not a good sport for tourists okay thanks for the warning stick to bungee jumping wade going on the radio has really helped me to tap into local knowledge and very quickly get an accurate sense of what this predator is capable of but since coming here ive also tracked down an old newspaper report that describes a terrifying assault on a young girl this appears to be a very clear example of an eel deliberately trying to kill a human wade in 8-year-old carol davis wandered into a stream on her fathers property for several days previously large eels had been attacking mr daviss ducks then for reasons that arent*****************one of them decided to have a go at carol screaming the idea that an eel could drag a girl into deep water is entirely possible this is a fish that can actually swim backwards with real power carols horror story has really concentrated my mind not only was she attacked in shallow water her ordeal also happened in broad daylight it makes me wonder what would happen to me under similar conditions its not just dark underground caves where you find eels lurking im in a wildlife park where i know there are half a dozen big longfins im not yet ready to try this out in the wild where if things went wrong id be miles from*****************help nonetheless theres no such thing as a tame eel and ive already heard enough to put me on edge their mouths are lined with hundreds of backward-pointing teeth and the ones in here are certainly big enough to grab an ankle or a hand aah im treading in sort of roots here the trouble is theyre gonna be lurking right in there i dont want to get my toes nipped after a couple of nervy encounters i decide to push my luck ive actually got one right here there we go whew short and dramatic thats my first real contact with one of these big longfin eels clearly well-fed eels like these just arent aggressive but im not*****************myself theyll be so placid in the wild in new zealands south island i leave the beaten track and push into the mountains some of the biggest eels mentioned in historical records were caught from deep lakes in the interior and this is where im focusing my search for a monster wade on lake manapouri in what feels like the middle of nowhere i first join evan brunton a man who tracks and catches eels for a living there are parts of this lake that plunge to more than a quarter of a mile deep room enough for a monster to hide in even today wade so weve actually got over feet in the middle i mean thats way*****************even here the chances of finding a giant eel are slim but the 16-pounder that evan hauls out is still an impressive animal so powerful you can imagine that a 30-pound could drag someone away theres some eels up in the speaks indistinctly that have been up to pound and theyve been caught and reliably weighed - yes they have - gosh wade evans accounts of monstrous 100-pound eels have got me itching to fish but first theres a niggling question at the back of my mind i can well believe that a massive eel could seize someone and drag them under but with teeth designed to grip rather than cut im skeptical about whether it could actually dismember and devour a person if captain cooks man-eater really is a huge longfin then this animal must have some other way to rip you apart to see how im laying on*****************journal how that could devour a person is still not immediately obvious with my surveillance cameras switched on i retreat to a makeshift control room the stage is set all i can do now is sit and wait for nearly two hours nothing shows up if eels are sensitive to electricity then it could be that my cameras are spooking them or perhaps theyre just biding their time until dark suddenly they appear out of nowhere and like a pack of wolves they start to attack the carcass straining to see in the pitch black i catch my first glimpse of how these predators could rip you to shreds here we go its getting in there yep its latching on its actually spinning its spinning around these eels are feeding like crocodiles gripping the victim firmly then spinning violently to twist off chunks of flesh it actually reminds me of*****************make a real mess of someone given half a chance ive also tracked down credible stories of massive eels living in new zealands remote backwaters yet just when im ready to try and catch one of these slippery monsters i run into an unexpected problem in wilderness areas like this fishing for eels with hooks is now strictly forbidden ive no choice but to give up my usual methods and start from scratch eel fisherman vic thompson is my teacher im gonna make a bob for you simply find a bit of steak like that or a bit of any red meat and cut it into a slim slice and ive got a bit

just*****************it feels like ive been disarmed beeping its still in the mouth its still in its mouth look at that just came out oop come here there we go my first fish on a bob the technique actually works and it works for two reasons bit of role reversal here normally its me providing the hook this eel has got hundreds of little hooks in its mouth in the form of teeth and thats why it catches onto that bob it sort of hooks in the other thing is its a predator and so it thinks that bait is getting away so it hangs on and if im quick about it its up on the bank before it actually knows whats going on okay ooh so im putting you back no need to struggle im actually putting you back lovely ive just caught a fish without using a hook it*****************works wade spurred on by my success i push further into even wilder backwaters to places where few people ever fish the eels here are as bold and as willing to strike as any ive seen and with my bobbing skills improving fast im soon dragging them out at up to feet long but im looking for a beast twice this size and time is running out if the animal described by captain cook really was an eel then seemingly the big ones are very rare or even perhaps a thing of the past so far the monster ive come in search of has eluded me but i still have some unfinished business with the longfin eel that may*****************newspaper report of a girl being dragged into the water girl screaming but i have to admit there is still a grain of doubt in my mind to be totally convinced i need to see the proof for myself and theres only one way that i can do that wade my destination is a remote river in the heart of a primeval wilderness i want to find out if wild longfin eels large or small are willing to attack a healthy adult human ive already been in the water with these animals in a zoo this time its going to be very different the place ive chosen is swarming with eels and because theyre wild theyll be hungry the question is will they be bold enough to have a crack at me to draw them in i first soak my clothes with fish guts put simply im turning myself into*****************bait ahh i feel my heart starting to pound ive done some crazy things in my time getting into a pool with piranhas going into murky water after snakeheads but this has to be one of the scariest things ive done for protection im wearing chain mail gloves and a thick wet suit and ill be sticking close to the bank within minutes eels start to emerge from their hiding holes the question is are any eels going to bite that is just so snakelike coming out of the water with its mouth like that im hoping theyre going for my hands but they seem to be interested in other parts of my clothing which is a bit disconcerting*****************even if i move if i move my legs i move my hands its not really sending them away at all theyre coming right in close the thing about these fish these are not fish that people feed these are wild fish so they are hungry theyre bumping my legs theyre tugging at my shirt and theyre coming in on my fingers as well im actually wearing gloves these are kevlar gloves and i wouldnt be too happy doing it without those ah i do want to hold my ground i mean ive come this far i dont want to get out too too quickly wade its broad daylight and from their point of view im a big animal*****************theyre totally unfazed get out no ill need kevlar underpants as well most fish would not do this at all even piranhas ow that was inside of the thigh inside of the thigh what i dont want is for them to draw blood if they draw blood that could really get them going ah ah that is one aggressive fish ah look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that ah i think its time for me to get out get out get out wade i came here wondering if the monster described so long ago by captain cook was in fact a giant eel short of seeing an 8-footer i cant be*****************yet its clear to me that without protective clothing these eels would have ripped into my flesh and tried to eat me alive and with this animal it isnt just about size slip and fall over in some lonely river and its the hungry pack that could seal your fate,the new zealand longfin eel anguilla dieffenbachii is a species of freshwater eel that is endemic to new zealand it is the largest freshwater eel in new zealand and the only endemic species the other eels found in new zealand are the native shortfin eel anguilla australis also found in australia and the naturally introduced australian longfin eel anguilla reinhardtii longfin eels are long-lived migrating to the pacific ocean near tonga to breed at the end of their lives they are good climbers as juveniles and so are found in streams and lakes a long way inland an important traditional food source for maori who name them orea longfin eel numbers are declining and they are classified as endangered but over one hundred tonnes are still commercially fished each year description the easiest way to identify the longfin eel is by the length of its fins the dorsal top fin*****************about two-thirds the length of the body and starts significantly further towards the head than the anal bottom fin in the shortfin eel the fins are of similar length when a longfin eel bends its loose skin wrinkles distinctively inside each bend where a shortfin eels skin is smooth a longfins mouth extends past its eyes further than a shortfins female longfin eels are larger and longer-lived than males males average cm but reach up to cm in length with an average age of years years females are considerably larger ranging from cm with an average length of cm females attain an age of to years before migrating to sea to breed longfin eels in the north island migrate*****************a younger age and thus have faster generation times determining longfin sex is difficult as their sexual organs are not determined until they are over cm in length the only method to determine longfin eels sex is through internal examination and only becomes easy to distinguish when the eels mature and migrate life cycle like other members of the anguillidae longfin eels have a rather unusual life cycle they grow and mature into fertile adults in fresh water then migrate to the sea to breed this catadromous breeding system also ensures randomised mating creating a panmictic population the new zealand longfin eel is a very long-lived fish with records of females reaching years old and weighing up to kg*****************have the slowest growth rate of any eel species studied just centimetres a year longfin eels life cycle like other species of anguillidae eels is rather complex consisting of four distinct life stages which remained a mystery for many decades and still is not fully understood new zealand longfins breed only once at the end of their lives making a journey of thousands of kilometres from new zealand to their spawning grounds near tonga their eggs of which each female eel produces between and million are fertilized in an unknown manner but probably in deep tropical water the mature eels then die their eggs floating to the surface to hatch into very flat leaf-like larvae called leptocephalus that then*****************along large oceanic currents back to new zealand this drifting is thought to take up to months there have been no recorded captures of either the eggs or larvae of longfin eels upon arriving in new zealand the larvae undergo a transformation metamorphosis into glass eels like small transparent adult eels these occupy estuaries for their first year during which they develop colouration and become elvers which resemble small adult longfin eels the elvers migrate upstream where they develop into adults the recruitment of glass eels into new zealands freshwater river networks is a very variable process thought to be affected by the el nino and la nina southern oscillations this is a major reason for the failure of*****************eel aquaculture in the 1970s diet longfin eels have an omnivorous diet and are opportunistic feeders their diet as small eels largely consists of insect larvae such as dragonfly nymphs procordulia grayi as the eels grow they also feed heavily on lymnaea snails and fish including galaxiids the upland bully and yearling trout which are taken by larger eels there are reports of these eels eating small waterfowl such as ducklings habitat and distribution anguilla dieffenbachii is endemic species to new zealand widely distributed through the countrys lakes and rivers including the chatham islands longfin eels are often found great distances inland up to km along fresh waterways and in high country lakes which are connected to the sea*****************in their inland distribution is their climbing ability in elver juvenile stage under cm in length these migration events frequently coincide with increased temperate water flow and low light conditions at this size the elvers can travel up to km inland over a summer and have been observed climbing near-vertical surfaces up to m tall this feat is accomplished through a combination of surface tension with the water and friction where in a waterway longfin eels live depends on their life stage as juveniles they prefer shallow water under m deep with coarse substratum and faster than average stream flow such as that found in riffles adult longfin eels tend to be found next to or under large pieces*****************debris and undercut river banks significance for maori orea are an important traditional food source for maori who have long had extensive knowledge of the timing of their upstream and downstream migrations commercial fishing the commercial fishing of longfin eels began to gain momentum in the 1960s and by the 1970s there was a tonne yearly catch the fishery went into decline in the early 1980s and in the fishing season only tonnes were taken commercial longfin eel fishing was included in the quota management system qms in for the south island and for the north island this set limits to the minimum and maximum size grams and kg and the total allowable catch tac as of the tac*****************not been reached in any fishing season since the implementation of the qms in recognition of the traditional significance of longfin eels maori have a percent allocation of fishery stocks the capture and export of glass eels in new zealand has been prohibited as of up to tonnes of eels including longfin eels were still being caught for export despite the species being officially classified as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species aquaculture there have been a number of attempts at aquaculture of longfin eels the first were in the 1970s and did not remain operational for long with the last farm closing in the most common reasons for these*****************were economic the high cost of production vs low price for the eels variable recruitment of glass eels and the high mortality death rates in the farms since the early 2000s there has been renewed interest in the aquaculture of longfins due to the increasing knowledge of their biology and the diminishing stocks of european eels anguilla anguilla but no farms have been built conservation in biologist don jellyman predicted longfin numbers would drop by between and in the following decade the species was classified in and again in by the department of conservation as at risk declining under criteria c21 total area of occupancy ha km2 predicted decline the doc panel concluded though that the commercial fishery of*****************species is stable or increasing and noted that public discourse on the longfin eel portrays the species as being severely threatened despite data that indicate otherwise this conclusion has been seriously questioned repeatedly both before and since then throwing its validity into doubt in june it was reported that some pet food companies use the nationally threatened eels in their products sparking outrage by conservationists scientists and conservation groups have growing concern for the survival of the species as they can be legally killed and have a slow reproduction rate breeding only once at the end of their lifetime the iucn assessment noted a sharp decline in longfin numbers over the last century accompanied by significant reduction of habitat*****************iucn currently classes the species as endangered making the following notes population severely fragmented continued reduction in mature individuals continuing decline in areaextent andor quality of habitat despite this the new zealand

hidden predator,bull shark,carcharhinus leucas,wade ithe bull shark is the bad boy of the shark worldi ithought to be responsible for more attacks on peoplei ithan any other sharki itheir ferocity is the stuff of nightmaresi ipound for pound they are the ultimate killer sharki ilast year i traveled to queensland australiai ito investigate three potential bull shark attacks i ithe first in the surf zone at the mouth of a river i ithe second on a man swimming at night in an inland lagoon i ithe third on a thoroughbred racehorse miles upstreami iat exactly the same time i was therei ithe biggest bull shark ever caughti iwas pulled out of a south african riveri ipopular with swimmersi iupon hearing thisi ii instantly feared another deadly situationi imy name is jeremy wadei ibiologist and extreme fishermani i travel the world iinvestigating stories of freshwater monstersi thats the killer blow thats about the thickness of my leg this feels a good-size fish iim heading to south africai ito find out why sharks are leaving their patchi iand moving into minei thats the fish dorsal and tail dorsal and tail ijanuary a series of unusual sightingsi iin the breede river south africai ikick-starts an investigationi iwhat the scientists discoveri ishocks both the scientific and the local communitiesi ifor not only is this river inhabited by sharksi iit is home to the biggest bull shark ever caughti ianywhere in the worldi imeasuring feet in lengthi iit is more than feet longer than the previous recordi ia year later the team is backi ito see if they can discover why it was herei iwhy it was so big and if that giant was alonei this is where i come in im just as puzzled as the scientists by whats going on here and my many years experience of tracking down and catching monster fish from rivers have got me the unique opportunity to join the investigation what we find out could help to answer the most important question of all is the presence of this known man-eater a human tragedy just waiting to happen iim more accustomed to searching for monstersi iin rivers that tumble from mountain passes i men singing in native language ior investigating tribal myths in tropical jungles i iplaces very remote from our modern worldi iso this is going to be very differenti ifrom anything ive done beforei ithis is the sleepy fishing village of witsandi iin a remote corner of south africa i inot the place i would normally hunt for a river monsteri ihowever under the surface of this peaceful scenei ilurks a monster bigger and more aggressivei ithan anything i have ever encounteredi ibut how can a saltwater shark survive in freshwateri iit is said that for most sharksi ispending a day in freshwateri iwould be like a man walking on the moon without a space suiti ibut bull sharks are differenti ithey have sensors all over their bodyi iwhich sample the salt content of the wateri iworking in a way similar to our taste budsi ia special organ called the rectal glandi iacts like an on-off switchi ireleasing or retaining salt as requiredi iits their ability to move from shallow coastal watersi iwhere they normally live up into riversi ithat makes them one of the most dangerous of all sharksi boy wait iive investigated fatal attacks in australian riversi ibut bull sharks have also attackedi iin the ganges in india the tigris in irani iin lake nicaraguai iand even in the us in new jerseys matawan creeki iand now one has been found here in the breede river i ionly this one was much much bigger i iswimming undetected where people swimi iperhaps freshwater rivers are no safer than the open seai iso far i only have a few photosi iand newspaper clippings to go oni iso i meet up with shark scientist meaghen mccordi iwho brings me right up to datei what exactly happened last year we were here for three days fishing on the third day we were up in the area up there thats commonly known as hunpunt imeaghen led last years expeditioni iwhich caught the bull sharki iknown further up the coast as the zambezi sharki mccord suddenly around in the afternoon our angler had his fish taken reel clicking and about hours later we managed to see that it actually was a zambezi shark what are you hoping to find out this year this year jeremy first of all we want to find out whether that shark was just a once-off in the system were really counting on you to catch us another animal inormally i head out on my expeditionsi ito unpick a riddle and satisfy my own curiosityi ibut this timei ii have a scientific team depending on mei iand the results could mean the differencei ibetween life and deathi ithis is the biggest fishing challenge i have ever facedi iand if i connect with one of these sharksi iit could be the biggest fish i have ever hookedi iits only now that i realize what ive gotten intoi the sharks in this river have a very specific way of feeding and that has actually given me quite a challenge in terms of what rig i use because ive got to come up with something that presents the bait actually in quite a delicate way but at the same time is strong enough to give me half a chance to get the shark in and to be honest at the moment im not quite sure how im going to achieve that isharks have evolved the greatest sensitivityi ito electricity of any animali itiny pores around the snouti icalled the ampullae of lorenzinii idetect minute electrical fieldsi iproduced by other animals in the wateri ibut they could also detect electrical microcurrentsi iproduced by my metal hook and leaderi iwhich is going to make bait presentation very difficulti im basically just looking at what else ive got in my bag ive got various different types of wire ive got smaller hooks yeah i think im just gonna have to play around with stuff for a few hours and just see what i can come up with what im thinking of using is something like this the trouble with these sharks here is if you fish too heavy theyre just not gonna take the bait the bait isnt going to act naturally so hopefully something like that is gonna work iits hard to believei ithat once ive caught a potential man-eateri ithe scientists will release it back into the riveri ilike putting a fox back into the chicken coopi iits no surprise that this project is so controversiali iwith my rig built i team up with skipper mark wolfi ihe has years of experience fishing the breede riveri ihis knowledge will be invaluablei iif im to catch myself a big sharki iwe head to the spoti iwhere the team caught the monster last yeari ito catch sharks in the breede riveri iyou first need live baiti this feels good bait size very strong oh there it is ii only use live bait if i have toi iand this is one of those occasionsi ithe sharks in this river will eat nothing elsei thats why theyre called a grunter you can hear that noise it makes fish grunting iim hoping the grunter struggling on the linei iwill have caught the attention of a sharki ii transfer it to my heavier geari iand get it straight back into the riveri its actually a very strongly swimming bait its about yards off there and thats right off the line it came in on one hook straight onto another one and out into the water its possible if theres shark in the area they actually checked that out on the way in and they could well be sort of lurking around eyeing that up iim using a balloon rather than a conventional floati iattached by a thin rubber bandi ithis allows the bait to swim freely in midwateri ibut when a shark takes the balloon will break awayi iso the shark wont feel any resistancei iwhich could make it drop the baiti ii will then begin a count of 20i ii have to know that the shark has properly taken the baiti iso that when i tighten upi imy circle hook will pull into the corner of its mouthi ii may only get one chance and i dont want to blow iti just a case now of waiting ion the surface this place is an earthly paradisei iin sharp contrast to the picture underwateri iwhere there lurks a beast that is the embodiment of savageryi has the shark taken that or is that the bait just running thats not shooting out at speed ah yes yes yes yes there we go one two three ifrom the moment the baits takeni ithe speed of the run tells me this has to be a sharki anchor up anchor up please anchor up iand nothing else in this river could engulf a bait that sizei 12 inow i must keep a cool headi iand wait for a count of before i engage the reeli 19 right tightening up tightening up tightening up tightening up theres the balloon heading for the horizon here we go ieven with my harness absorbing a lot of the straini ithis is like nothing ive ever hooked beforei oh this slings in the way a little bit of an obstacle course this fish just feels so powerful without even really trying its just taking line iive chased big fish all over the worldi iand experience tells mei ithat this could be the biggest ive hooked i imore than capable of dragging me overboardi iif i make a wrong movei looks like it might come up yes just saw a fin break the surface coming to the left now this is quite a fast fish its quite lively which is good cause it means its tiring itself out looks like a take on the line coming up coming up coming up reel clicking there it is i think i could be ready oh i think they might have what happened ithat shark felt as big as anything ive ever caughti what went ibut ill never know for certaini yeah it went exhales sharply thats actually thats bitten through the wire bitten through the wire so thats a bite-off ah ah score one to the fish ii was overconfidenti ii thought i was bringing the shark ini ibut now i realize the shark was bringing the fight to mei ii could see it was largei ibut it was not the 1000-pounder caught last yeari iwhich means theres more than one shark using this riveri iand thats a concern to everyone living herei i hate losing fish youre always haunted by the memory of the big one that got away but it did tell me something it suggests that there could be a lot more shark in here than anyone suspected ilast year the team courted controversyi iafter catching the 1000-pound bull sharki ifrom this south african riveri ithey ran a series of tests attached an electronic tagi iand then released it back into the riveri so you got the tag in what did you find out from that tag in the time you were here we really had no idea what to expect from the shark over the course of the next hours that we tracked her she moved up and down the river to within feet of people who were pumping for prawns and in shallow water that was probably just up to mid-thigh wade and how far up did you track her mccord we tracked her as far as kilometers upriver which we thought was really amazing and needless to say it sort of freaked out the local witsand residents imany of the human residents were less than happyi ithat the worlds biggest bull shark had been releasedi iand was again swimming freely in their riveri ibut this wasnt the only bull sharki ithat made the headlines that weeki iexperienced lifeguard sikhanyiso bangilizwei iwas keeping watch over a stretch of beachi ialong the natal shorei ihe went out on a training swimi ion a route he had swum many times beforei ithe unprovoked attack came out of the bluei ibangilizwe didnt stand a chancei iclose inspection of the wounds on bangilizwes bodyi iconfirmed that it was a bull sharki ithat attacked and killed himi ieven though this attack happenedi i600 miles up the coasti iit still helped to stoke the angeri iin witsands riverside communityi isome residents were understandably concernedi ithat the worlds biggest bull sharki ihad been put back into their riveri iand meaghen had some explaining to doi ishe even received serious threatsi ifor her part in releasing the sharki iits still hard to believe that after i catch onei ithe scientists will require me to release iti iback into the river where people fish and playi wade oh oh one two three iive been given a second chancei anchor up please anchor up iand im not going to let this one get awayi tightening up tightening up tightening up tightening up okay right were on were on were on were on and its running its running its running look at that its really cutting sideways really cutting sideways - reel clicking - oh that was really heart-stopping when it suddenly goes slack you think its off and then theres tension there again its probably kicking or rolling on the line even ithis apex predator is not accustomedi ito this kind of treatmenti there he is iinstead of running away its coming in to check me outi ii cant imagine what the shark is making of this experiencei hes coming down with a lot of fish you see them up on the surface you see them close in you think thats it theyre nearly done there i think this one was just coming up partly out of curiosity whats all this whats happening now hes checked me out hes not coming anywhere near again ilast time the shark brought things to an early endi iby rolling on the linei ithis one seems set for the long hauli two hours two hours its a different phase of the fight now it was tearing around you know using speed in the early stages there it is again there it is again there it is again theres definitely some tactics going on the speed didnt work so now just a bit of a war of attrition ah this is punishment itwo hours into the fighti ithe shark begins pulling the boat towards some shallowsi were under meters now iby now the battle is beginning to attract attentioni ithis is turning into an eventi ieveryone wants to see this sharki wade i can see the fish i can see the fish back to meters iif my line catches a rock down therei iit could cut through and the shark will be gonei we got to get away from the rocks here were still in meters now iive got a boat full of scientistsi irelying on me to get this shark ini ithe tension on board is palpablei - meters - there okay ive got the line if it goes it can go without the line catching anybody pull that line round the right have you got the tow strap round - yep - good okay brilliant - got a good hold - yeah okay ithis is my biggest catch everi iand hours is by far my longest fighti iits astonishing to thinki ithat ive hauled this beast from a riveri yeah chuckles ibut i was lucky to get it in at alli ibecause it was foul-hooked in the sidei isnagged on a flap of skin between the gill slitsi ithe scientists want to know why the sharks are herei right this is like sort of time is of the essence and theyre actually theyre starting to pump water to irrigate the gills that buys a little bit more time ilast years giant catch was a heavily pregnant femalei iwhich led the scientists to assumei ishe was in this river to deliver her 2-foot-long pupsi iour expectation is that this fish too is femalei mccord 2 man just gonna hold him in place mccord its a male indistinct talking iour first catch and we have answered one of our questionsi iit looks like the breede riveri iis a place where sharks come to feedi mccord 2 i9 feeti iand with an estimated weight near poundsi ihes one of the largest bull sharks ever caught anywherei iand im returning him back into the riveri iive just caught a giant but im not off the hooki ithe scientists want me to try for another i iand this time even biggeri ithere is heated controversy about returning the sharksi ito the river where people swim and playi ibut unlike bull sharks elsewhere in the worldi ithese bull sharks have never attacked a personi iso what makes the breede river sharks so unusuali ihunting for clues i talk to local fishermeni iwho fish these waters for grunter and cobi - wade big one - svede this one yeah icoba svede is a fisherman and a kite surferi ihes been here for yearsi iand has had his fair share of shark encountersi any thoughts why that might be and youre confident that if you just take basic precautions youre perfectly happy about going in the water yourself ieugene beukes is one of only a handfuli iof commercial fishermen left in witsandi ihis knowledge of sharksi ihas been passed down through his familyi yeah yeah are you surprised that no people have been attacked iive had a call from paul one of the tracking teami iwho has just witnessed a bull shark attacki iright off the harbor walli this is the victim is it it was incredible i just put the boat alongside and heard a giant splash about yards off the harbor wall here there was a giant pool of blood the fish floated up to the surface ione of the reasons bull sharks got their namei iis because they are known to ram their preyi ibefore they kill iti ithis can clearly be seeni iby the marks along the side of this cobi so you reckon its actually just hit it from the sides and then when its floundering in the water just came along and just i mean that i mean that is just muscle but thats the killer blow isnt it paul straight through ia battering ram armed with razor-sharp teethi thats about the thickness of my leg which is quite disconcerting its gone right through the backbone as well just clean through gee this is actually the biggest cob that ive seen so far and that is iwithouti the final third which is out there somewhere inside a shark iwitnessing how they hit monster-size preyi imakes me even more determinedi ito land a monster-size bull sharki ibefore i try againi ii have the opportunity to discoveri iexactly what the breede river bull sharks are doingi ithat sets them apart from bull sharks in other riversi iwe head out to track the shark that i caught and releasedi ithe acoustic tagi iwhich we secured to the back of the sharki itransmits a signali iwhich we hear as a ping on our hydrophonei ithe clearer the sound the closer the sharki its up its up wade yeah so a bit further up yeah all right maybe the hint of something we might be just out of the main range iwe end up miles upriver in search of the tagged sharki man shouting indistinctly what apparently the guy there just said you mustnt catch sharks here cause we swim here um im not quite sure what the logic of that is chuckles i think you know whether we catch them or not theyre here apparently the big one last year was tracked right past these houses on several occasions yeah meanwhile the one were looking for at the moment no sign or shall i say no sound of it iwe turn and retrace our steps back downriveri isearching as we goi ieventually we come across a group of fishing boatsi ijust off witsandi ia couple of fishermeni ihave just had a very close encounter with a sharki teeth marks there teeth there teeth there just trying to get a look at that man he had him in its mouth ithe shark tried to steal their catch as they brought it ini iso i know theres a shark here and its hungryi pinging wade ah theres a beep already yeah iwe found the tagged shark that i released yesterdayi 81 so were straight ahead so its actually oh oh ithe hydrophone signal peaks at 100i iso means the shark is within yards of our boati slightly worried about having my hands close to the water now pinging there we go according to the hydrophone the fish is being you know right under that boat im just listening to the beats and looking at the screen and then when i get the strongest signal i hold it here i look up and its just pointing straight at the boat ithe breede river bull sharksi ihave learned to shadow fishing boatsi iwaiting for fish to be hooked then taking them off the linei iits very specific systematic behaviori ithere are no records of bull sharks doing thisi ianywhere else in the worldi iand i just witnessed it firsthandi iits like a protection paymenti ithe sharks steal a percentage of the fishermens catchi iand in exchange they leave humans alone i iat least for nowi normally one of the first things youve got to do is actually locate the fish but it appears that here even though weve got a lot of water i dont have to go looking for the shark theyre gonna come looking for me ito many its the stuff of nightmares i ia heavily populated riveri ithats also home to massive hungry bull sharksi ibut can i make this worki for imei iand catch myself a monsteri imy plan is to position myself right next to the fishermeni iand let the sharks come to mei yep lots of activity on the river today thats gonna get the sharks quite excited ii set up seven miles upriveri iin a spot close to where the team landedi ithe big female shark last year i ibut well away from this years tagged sharki iwhich was last located near the river mouthi ithe tracking team are out searching for him right nowi theres boats generally around the river i think the sharks today are gonna be active this is their big feeding day this is when the humans come and do the work for them ithe biggest bull shark ever recordedi iwas caught in this riveri iand im determined to catch anotheri ithen the tracking boat appearsi oh no right meaghens making signs like this its checking us out yeah it looks like the tagged shark is actually around the boat and i had no awareness of that at all until the tracking boat turned up theres actually been a shark circling the boat for quite a few minutes apparently and we were just totally unaware of it iwere being shadowed by a giant shark which is clearly huntingi ifrom now on well keep meaghen on boardi iwith the tracking equipmenti ithis way ill know exactly when the tagged shark is nearbyi iso i can get my bait out of the water before it strikesi pinging its close pinging continues this is just really frustrating its just proving so hard to keep away from that tagged shark its just covering such an area of water its right behind us now and we just popped it in when we arrived here this is actually one of the favored spots all clear and you know about five minutes after anchoring were getting a signal the sharks right under the boat catching it again would not be a good idea because at the moment weve got a stable situation it comes along its taking fish from fishermans boats and everybodys happy the fishermen arent too happy but that is its main or important source of food if anything actually makes the sharks wary of fish near boats they could start feeding in a more opportunistic way which you know might not be good news for the people around here so very important to avoid hooking that fish again iif i hook the same shark again or if anyone else doesi iit may become wary of its normal food sourcei iand start searching for other preyi iwe move on once againi iwere learning so muchi iabout the behavior of the bull sharks in this riveri ithat the scientists are desperate for mei ito make another catchi ithe capture of the male sharki itold us that theyre probably here to feedi pinging iand the tracking showed usi ithat theyre actively following fishing boatsi ifor an easy supply of foodi icatching another big onei iwould confirm the breede river as home of the monster sharksi reel clicking iive left the tagged shark several miles upriveri iand set up just off the town of witsandi this is what i use for goliath tigerfish nile perch things like that 80-pound line so a big shark on here would be very interesting i might just try pulling the bait a little bit if theres a predator watching sometimes just a little bit of movement its thinking about it its thinking do i want it dont i want it but its got time to think about it if you move it suddenly it can be like a reflex bang theyll hit it something had a go yeah wait a minute the balloon is gone one two three ithis could be the monster i came here fori it knows its hooked now this feels a good-size fish oh wait a minute whats happened there its running its running its running ionly a shark in this river runs with this power and speedi ibut ive got a problemi oh wait a minute whats happened there suddenly went slack no thats round something thats round something ah its actually snagged iive already lost one shark to a broken linei ii dont want to lose anotheri i can still feel the fish if we can go back mark just get it off that snag whatever it is this is not good i think were clear i think were clear oh the line is a bit shredded there oh that line is in a bad way ithis shark has taken the linei iround some debris on the bottomi iand even though it hasnt gone throughi iits very badly frayedi im only on about i dont know might only be strength on the line imy line is wearing throughi ibut if i try to bring the shark in too quicklyi ii could lose iti im just so nervous cause i know the lines not in good way ione hour and one mile further upriveri a friend of mine whos caught bull sharks said to me bull sharks its not like a mako shark which is a real speed merchant a bull shark is very solid very muscular itll just like take you for a walk i feel like a 6-year-old child taking a rottweiler for a walk iit feels bigger and stronger than the other sharki its just getting more lively all of a sudden its right under the bow if we can go left all right okay ithree miles from where i hooked the sharki iand its still pulling the boati people who say catching fish doesnt cause any pain theyre wrong my back is killing me not to mention where the rod butt is jammed oh dear its gonna be an interesting color after the end of all this ias the hours passi ithe shark continues to drag the boat up the riveri this is totally not normal in a river i had a giant stingray on for two hours but weve gone past that it must be now ithe fight is now heading towards its third houri ithe shark has taken the boat and me four miles upriveri it might come up it might come up coming towards the surface - reel clicking - thats the tail thats the fish dorsal and tail dorsal and tail first time its broken the surface its gonna show again reel clicking thats the dorsal ah wait its under the boat back please back back back back back back thats the last here we go right now absolute concentration if i say let go just let go all right okay grunts ithe gaff is necessary to hold the head upi ibut it barely punctures the tough skini bloody hell its not really gaffed is it this is gonna break the gaff its gonna break the bloody gaff ithis shark has battled with me for hoursi iand dragged the boat five miles up the riveri get to the back i think mccord we just need to get to the back you guys need to get off never had a fight anywhere like that long before thats almost double the longest fight i had with a freshwater stingray and those things just glue themselves to the bottom wow chuckles mccord pull wade the gaffs now out ithis bull shark is definitely largeri ithan the last one i caughti iwell keep it alive while the team take samplesi imeasure it and insert the acoustic tagi ithen get it back into the riveri sharks can actually pump water over their gills so im wedging the mouth open with a bit of wood and just shoving water in its mouth iits another male bull shark i i910 long and more than pounds i ithe biggest fish ive ever caughti iand one of the largest male bull sharks ever landedi tags are there samples taken parasites all the rest of it very quick operation but this thing having been so strong for so long is now just feeling a bit like i am so we just need to get it revived isharks trigger a primal fear like no otheri iand even though its utterly exhaustedi iafter fighting with me for nearly four hoursi ithis bull shark can still prompt a nervous run for landi mccord laughs itwo catches proving that last years shark was not a flukei iand that the breede river is homei ito some of the largest bull sharks anywhere in the worldi when i first came here i never imagined that what we would find out would take the investigation so far forward and actually provide likely answers to some of the big questions about the sharks in this river it seems that they come here during the warmer months of the year to feed but its not a random feeding strategy instead of wasting energy by chasing free-swimming fish theyre actually taking their food from anglers lines like plucking fruit from a tree its a very efficient way of feeding and perhaps this explains why the sharks in this river are so big this easy food source also possibly explains why there have never been any attacks on humans and as long as the numbers of those small fish remain healthy this remarkable coexistence between humans and potential man-eaters should continue,the bull shark carcharhinus leucas also known as the zambezi shark informally zambi in africa and lake nicaragua shark in nicaragua is a species of requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm shallow waters along coasts and in rivers it is known for its aggressive nature and presence mainly in warm shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and usually lower reaches of rivers their aggressive nature has led to ongoing shark-culling efforts near beaches to protect beachgoers which is one of the causes of bull shark populations continuing to decrease bull sharks are listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list bull sharks are euryhaline and can thrive in both salt and fresh water they are known to travel far up rivers and have been known to travel up the mississippi river as far as alton illinois about kilometres mi from the ocean but few freshwater interactions with humans have been recorded larger-sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of nearshore shark attacks including many incidents of shark bites attributed to other species unlike the river sharks of the genus glyphis bull sharks are not true freshwater sharks despite their ability to survive in freshwater habitats this shark appears in the image of the colones bill from costa rica etymology the name bull shark comes from the sharks stocky shape broad flat snout and aggressive unpredictable behavior in india the bull shark may be confused with the sundarbans or ganges shark in africa it is also commonly called the zambezi river shark or just zambi its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names including ganges river shark fitzroy creek whaler van rooyens shark lake nicaragua shark river shark freshwater whaler estuary whaler swan river whaler cub shark and shovelnose shark evolution some of the bull sharks closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation its genus carcharhinus also includes the sandbar shark which is not capable of osmoregulation the bull shark shares numerous similarities with river sharks of the genus glyphis and other species in the genus carcharhinus but its phylogeny has not been cleared yet anatomy and appearance bull sharks are large and stout with females being larger than males the bull shark can be up to cm ft in in length at birth adult female bull sharks average m ft long and typically weigh kg lb whereas the slightly smaller adult male averages m ft and kg lb while a maximum size of m ft is commonly reported a single record exists of a female specimen of exactly m ft a m ft long pregnant individual reached kg lb the maximum weight of the m ft long pregnant female can be over kg lb ranking it among the largest of the requiem sharks bull sharks are wider and heavier than other requiem sharks of comparable length and are grey on top and white below the second dorsal fin is smaller than the first the bull sharks caudal fin is longer and lower than that of the larger sharks and it has a small snout and lacks an interdorsal ridge bull sharks have a bite force up to newtons lbf weight for weight the highest among all investigated cartilaginous fishes exceptional specimens in early june off the coast of the florida keys near the western part of the atlantic ocean a female believed to measure at least m ft and kg lb was caught by members of the rj dunlap marine conservation program in the arabian sea off the coast of fujairah in the united arab emirates a pregnant shark weighing kg lb and measuring m ft long was caught in february followed by another specimen weighing about kg lb and measuring about the same in length in january unconfirmed reports suggest that the very largest exceptional specimens can possibly weigh up to kg lb distribution and habitat the bull shark is commonly found worldwide in coastal areas of warm oceans in rivers and lakes and occasionally salt and freshwater streams if they are deep enough it is found to a depth of m ft but does not usually swim deeper than m ft in the atlantic it is found from massachusetts to southern brazil and from morocco to angola populations of bull sharks are also found in several major rivers with more than bull sharks thought to be living in the brisbane river one was reportedly seen swimming the flooded streets of brisbane queensland australia during the queensland floods several were sighted in one of the main streets of goodna queensland shortly after the peak of the january floods a large bull shark was caught in the canals of scarborough just north of brisbane within moreton bay still greater numbers are in the canals of the gold coast queensland in the warmer months of the year bull sharks frequent sydney harbour in the pacific ocean it can be found from baja california to ecuador the bull shark has traveled km mi up the amazon river to iquitos in peru and north bolivia it also lives in freshwater lake nicaragua in the ganges and brahmaputra rivers of west bengal and assam in eastern india and adjoining bangladesh it can live in water with a high salt content as in st lucia estuary in south africa bull sharks have been recorded in the tigris river since at least as far upriver as baghdad and has been rumored to also inhabit the cahora bassa lake upstream of the zambezi the species has a distinct preference for warm currents after hurricane katrina many bull sharks were sighted in lake pontchartrain in july some local fishermen in the atchafalaya river have reported increasing numbers bull sharks have occasionally gone as far upstream in the mississippi river as alton illinois bull sharks have also been found in the potomac river in st marys county maryland from to a golf course lake at carbrook logan city queensland australia was the home to several bull sharks they were trapped following a flood of the logan and albert rivers in and resided in the acres ha lake until when they disappeared after another series of floods the golf course capitalized on the novelty changing their logo to feature the sharks and hosting a monthly tournament called the shark lake challenge behavior freshwater tolerance the bull shark is the best known of species of elasmobranch across genera and four families to have been reported in fresh andor brackish water other species that enter rivers include the stingrays dasyatidae potamotrygonidae and others and sawfish pristidae some skates rajidae smooth dogfishes triakidae and sandbar sharks carcharhinus plumbeus regularly enter estuaries the bull shark is diadromous meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease as they are euryhaline fishable to quickly adapt to a wide range of salinities thus the bull shark is one of the few cartilaginous fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems many of the euryhaline fish are bony fishes such as salmon or tilapia and are not closely related to bull sharks evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect with one being that the bull shark experienced a population bottleneck during the last ice age this bottleneck may have separated the bull shark from the rest of the elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system elasmobranchs ability to enter fresh water is limited because their blood is normally at least as salty in terms of osmotic strength as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood despite this the solute composition ie osmolarity of a bull shark in fresh water is still much higher than that of the external environment this results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the sharks body however bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance these are the rectal gland kidneys liver and gills all elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland thereby conserving sodium and chloride the kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine but also play an important role in the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood the gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters this may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy bull sharks are able to regulate themselves to live in either fresh or salt water it can live in fresh water for its entire life but this does not happen mostly due to the reproductive needs of the shark young bull sharks leave the brackish water in which they are born and move out into the sea to breed while is theoretically possible for bull sharks to live purely in fresh water experiments conducted on bull sharks found that they died within four years the stomach was opened and all that was found were two small unidentifiable fishes the cause of death could have been starvation since the primary food source for bull sharks resides in salt water in a research experiment the bull sharks were found to be at the mouth of an estuary for the majority of the time they stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water the driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water however is its age as the bull shark ages its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases the majority of the newborn or very young bull sharks were found in the freshwater area whereas the much older bull sharks were found to be in the saltwater areas as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity reproduction is one of the reasons why adult bull sharks travel into the riverit is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival and a way to increase overall fitness of bull sharks the young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out initially scientists thought the sharks in lake nicaragua belonged to an endemic species the lake nicaragua shark carcharhinus nicaraguensis in following specimen comparisons taxonomists synonymized them bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean and vice versa with some taking as few as seven to days to complete the journey a study of six bull sharks confined to a stagnant golf course lake in brisbane australia from to uncovered their adaptability to low-salinity environments marking the longest recorded residency for the species under such conditions and demonstrating their ability to live indefinitely in low-salinity aquatic environments diet the bull shark is a marine apex predator capable of taking a variety of prey the bull sharks diet consists mainly of bony fish and small sharks including other bull sharks and stingrays their diet can also include turtles birds dolphins terrestrial mammals crustaceans and echinoderms they hunt in murky waters where it is harder for the prey to see the shark coming bull sharks have been known to use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey after the first initial contact they continue to bite and tackle prey until the prey is unable to flee the bull shark is a solitary hunter though may briefly pair with another bull shark to make hunting and tricking prey easier sharks are opportunistic feeders and the bull shark is no exception to this as it is part of the carcharhinus family of sharks normally sharks eat in short bursts and when food is scarce sharks digest for a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation as part of their survival mechanism bull sharks will regurgitate the food in their stomachs in order to escape from a predator this is a distraction tactic if the predator moves to eat the regurgitated food the bull shark can use the opportunity to escape reproduction bull sharks mate during late summer and early autumn often in bays and estuaries after gestating for months a bull shark may give birth to to live young they are viviparous born live and free-swimming the young are about cm in at birth the bull shark does not rear its young the young bull sharks are born into flat protected areas coastal lagoons river mouths and other low-salinity estuaries are common nursery habitats the male bull shark is able to begin reproducing around the age of years while the female cannot begin reproducing until the age of years the size of a fully matured female bull shark to produce viable eggs for fertilization seems to be cm to cm the courting routine between bull sharks has not been observed in detail as of yet the male likely bites the female on the tail until she can turn upside down and the male can copulate at that point mature females commonly have scratches from the mating process interactions with humans since bull sharks often dwell in very shallow waters are found in many types of habitats are territorial by nature and have no tolerance for provocation they may be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark bull sharks are one of the three shark species along with the tiger shark and great white shark most likely to bite humans one or several bull sharks may have been responsible for the jersey shore shark attacks of while it is a common misconception that these attacks were the inspiration for the novel jaws its author peter benchley has stated this is not the case the speculation that bull sharks may have been responsible is based on two fatal bites occurring in brackish and fresh water bull sharks have attacked swimmers around the sydney harbour inlets in india bull sharks swim up the ganges bramaputra mahanadi and other indian rivers and have bitten bathers many of these bite incidents were attributed to the ganges shark glyphis gangeticus a critically endangered river shark species although the sand tiger shark was also blamed during the 1960s and 1970s bull sharks have also attacked humans off the coast of florida visual cues behavioral studies have confirmed that sharks can take visual cues to discriminate between different objects the bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater it was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water bright yellow mesh netting was found to be easily avoided when it was placed in the path of the bull shark this was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black energy conservation in researchers tagged and recorded the movements of young bull sharks in the caloosahatchee river estuary they were testing to find out what determined the movement of the young bull sharks it was found that the young bull sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed this large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators the movement was found to be directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself one way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes the bull shark uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment ecology humans are the biggest threat to bull sharks larger sharks such as the tiger shark and great white shark may attack them but typically only target juveniles crocodiles may be a threat to bull sharks in rivers saltwater crocodiles have been observed preying on bull sharks in the rivers and estuaries of northern australia and a nile crocodile was reportedly sighted consuming a bull shark in south africa conservation the bull shark is listed as a vulnerable species on the iucn red list and its population is decreasing despite its status the species isnt named as a protected species threats to the bull shark are numerous such as getting caught in fishing nets overfishing for their oil skin and meat pollution to their habitat and more in many areas of the world including australia and south africa there are shark-culling measures around beaches to prevent attacks on beach-goers researchers tried to fix the problem of sharks getting too close to land by testing out a device called the sharksafe barriertm this barrier used magnetic and visual stimuli which utilized rows of piping to create a continuous magnetic field to deter the sharks however researchers concluded that the technology needs to be improved and tested further before it can be implemented as a reliable safety measure other research is being conducted to come up with conservation solutions for the bull sharks one example is the nature conservancy satellite tagging sharks to track their migration and find their habitats in order to guide what areas require further protection projects see also outline of sharks list of sharks list of fatal unprovoked shark attacks in the united states by decade

years expeditioni iwhich caught the bull sharki iknown further up the coast as the zambezi sharki mccord suddenly around in the afternoon our angler had his fish taken reel clicking and about hours later we managed to see that it actually was a zambezi shark what are you hoping to find out this year this year jeremy first of all we want to find out*****************that shark was just a once-off in the system were really counting on you to catch us another animal inormally i head out on my expeditionsi ito unpick a riddle and satisfy my own curiosityi ibut this timei ii have a scientific team depending on mei iand the results could mean the differencei ibetween life and deathi ithis is the biggest fishing challenge i have ever facedi iand if i connect with one of these sharksi iit could be the biggest fish i have ever hookedi iits only now that i realize what ive gotten intoi the sharks in this river have a very specific way of feeding and that has actually given me quite a challenge in terms*****************wateri ibut they could also detect electrical microcurrentsi iproduced by my metal hook and leaderi iwhich is going to make bait presentation very difficulti im basically just looking at what else ive got in my bag ive got various different types of wire ive got smaller hooks yeah i think im just gonna have to play around with stuff for a few hours and just see what i can come up with what im thinking of using is something like this the trouble with these sharks here is if you fish too heavy theyre just not gonna take the bait the bait isnt going to act naturally so hopefully something like that is gonna work iits hard to believei ithat once ive caught a potential man-eateri ithe scientists will release it back into the riveri ilike putting a fox back into the chicken coopi iits no surprise that this project*****************so controversiali iwith my rig built i team up with skipper mark wolfi ihe has years of experience fishing the breede riveri ihis knowledge will be invaluablei iif im to catch myself a big sharki iwe head to the spoti iwhere the team caught the monster last yeari ito catch sharks in the breede riveri iyou first need live baiti this feels good bait size very strong oh there it is ii only use live bait if i have toi iand this is one of those occasionsi ithe sharks in this river will eat nothing elsei thats why theyre called a grunter you can hear that noise it makes fish grunting iim hoping the grunter struggling on the linei*****************have caught the attention of a sharki ii transfer it to my heavier geari iand get it straight back into the riveri its actually a very strongly swimming bait its about yards off there and thats right off the line it came in on one hook straight onto another one and out into the water its possible if theres shark in the area they actually checked that out on the way in and they could well be sort of lurking around eyeing that up iim using a balloon rather than a conventional floati iattached by a thin rubber bandi ithis allows the bait to swim freely in midwateri ibut when a shark takes the balloon will break awayi iso*****************that is the embodiment of savageryi has the shark taken that or is that the bait just running thats not shooting out at speed ah yes yes yes yes there we go one two three ifrom the moment the baits takeni ithe speed of the run tells me this has to be a sharki anchor up anchor up please anchor up iand nothing else in this river could engulf a bait that sizei inow i must keep a cool headi iand wait for a count of before i engage the reeli right tightening up tightening up tightening up tightening up theres the balloon heading for the horizon here we go ieven with my harness absorbing a lot of the straini ithis is like nothing ive ever hooked beforei oh this slings in the way a little bit of an obstacle course this fish just feels so powerful without even really*****************its just taking line iive chased big fish all over the worldi iand experience tells mei ithat this could be the biggest ive hooked i imore than capable of dragging me overboardi iif i make a wrong movei looks like it might come up yes just saw a fin break the surface coming to the left now this is quite a fast fish its quite lively which is good cause it means its tiring itself out looks like a take on the line coming up coming up coming up reel clicking there it is i think i could be ready oh i think they might have what happened ithat shark felt as big as anything ive ever caughti what*****************ibut ill never know for certaini yeah it went exhales sharply thats actually thats bitten through the wire bitten through the wire so thats a bite-off ah ah score one to the fish ii was overconfidenti ii thought i was bringing the shark ini ibut now i realize the shark was bringing the fight to mei ii could see it was largei ibut it was not the 1000-pounder caught last yeari iwhich means theres more than one shark using this riveri iand thats a concern to everyone living herei i hate losing fish youre always haunted by the memory of the big one that got away but it did tell me something it suggests that there could be a*****************more shark in here than anyone suspected ilast year the team courted controversyi iafter catching the 1000-pound bull sharki ifrom this south african riveri ithey ran a series of tests attached an electronic tagi iand then released it back into the riveri so you got the tag in what did you find out from that tag in the time you were here we really had no idea what to expect from the shark over the course of the next hours that we tracked her she moved up and down the river to within feet of people who were pumping for prawns and in shallow water that was probably just up to mid-thigh wade and how far up did you*****************her mccord we tracked her as far as kilometers upriver which we thought was really amazing and needless to say it sort of freaked out the local witsand residents imany of the human residents were less than happyi ithat the worlds biggest bull shark had been releasedi iand was again swimming freely in their riveri ibut this wasnt the only bull sharki ithat made the headlines that weeki iexperienced lifeguard sikhanyiso bangilizwei iwas keeping watch over a stretch of beachi ialong the natal shorei ihe went out on a training swimi ion a route he had swum many times beforei ithe unprovoked attack came out of the bluei ibangilizwe didnt stand a chancei iclose inspection of the wounds on*****************bodyi iconfirmed that it was a bull sharki ithat attacked and killed himi ieven though this attack happenedi i600 miles up the coasti iit still helped to stoke the angeri iin witsands riverside communityi isome residents were understandably concernedi ithat the worlds biggest bull sharki ihad been put back into their riveri iand meaghen had some explaining to doi ishe even received serious threatsi ifor her part in releasing the sharki iits still hard to believe that after i catch onei ithe scientists will require me to release iti iback into the river where people fish and playi wade oh oh one two three iive been given a second chancei anchor up please anchor up iand im not going*****************let this one get awayi tightening up tightening up tightening up tightening up okay right were on were on were on were on and its running its running its running look at that its really cutting sideways really cutting sideways - reel clicking - oh that was really heart-stopping when it suddenly goes slack you think its off and then theres tension there again its probably kicking or rolling on the line even ithis apex predator is not accustomedi ito this kind of treatmenti there he is iinstead of running away its coming in to check me outi ii cant imagine what the shark is making of this experiencei hes coming down with a lot of fish you see*****************up on the surface you see them close in you think thats it theyre nearly done there i think this one was just coming up partly out of curiosity whats all this whats happening now hes checked me out hes not coming anywhere near again ilast time the shark brought things to an early endi iby rolling on the linei ithis one seems set for the long hauli two hours two hours its a different phase of the fight now it was tearing around you know using speed in the early stages there it is again there it is again there it is again theres definitely some tactics going on the speed didnt work so now just a bit*****************a war of attrition ah this is punishment itwo hours into the fighti ithe shark begins pulling the boat towards some shallowsi were under meters now iby now the battle is beginning to attract attentioni ithis is turning into an eventi ieveryone wants to see this sharki wade i can see the fish i can see the fish back to meters iif my line catches a rock down therei iit could cut through and the shark will be gonei we got to get away from the rocks here were still in meters now iive got a boat full of scientistsi irelying on me to get this shark ini ithe tension on board is palpablei - meters - there okay*****************flap of skin between the gill slitsi ithe scientists want to know why the sharks are herei right this is like sort of time is of the essence and theyre actually theyre starting to pump water to irrigate the gills that buys a little bit more time ilast years giant catch was a heavily pregnant femalei iwhich led the scientists to assumei ishe was in this river to deliver her 2-foot-long pupsi iour expectation is that this fish too is femalei mccord man just gonna hold him in place mccord its a male indistinct talking iour first catch and we have answered one of our questionsi iit looks like the breede riveri iis a place where sharks come to feedi mccord i9 feeti iand with an estimated weight near poundsi ihes one of the largest bull sharks ever caught anywherei iand im returning him back into the riveri iive just*****************a giant but im not off the hooki ithe scientists want me to try for another i iand this time even biggeri ithere is heated controversy about returning the sharksi ito the river where people swim and playi ibut unlike bull sharks elsewhere in the worldi ithese bull sharks have never attacked a personi iso what makes the breede river sharks so unusuali ihunting for clues i talk to local fishermeni iwho fish these waters for grunter and cobi - wade big one - svede this one yeah icoba svede is a fisherman and a kite surferi ihes been here for yearsi iand has had his fair share of shark encountersi any thoughts why that might be and youre*****************that if you just take basic precautions youre perfectly happy about going in the water yourself ieugene beukes is one of only a handfuli iof commercial fishermen left in witsandi ihis knowledge of sharksi ihas been passed down through his familyi yeah yeah are you surprised that no people have been attacked iive had a call from paul one of the tracking teami iwho has just witnessed a bull shark attacki iright off the harbor walli this is the victim is it it was incredible i just put the boat alongside and heard a giant splash about yards off the harbor wall here there was a giant pool of blood the fish floated up to the surface ione of*****************reasons bull sharks got their namei iis because they are known to ram their preyi ibefore they kill iti ithis can clearly be seeni iby the marks along the side of this cobi so you reckon its actually just hit it from the sides and then when its floundering in the water just came along and just i mean that i mean that is just muscle but thats the killer blow isnt it paul straight through ia battering ram armed with razor-sharp teethi thats about the thickness of my leg which is quite disconcerting its gone right through the backbone as well just clean through gee this is actually the biggest cob that ive seen so far and that*****************iwithouti the final third which is out there somewhere inside a shark iwitnessing how they hit monster-size preyi imakes me even more determinedi ito land a monster-size bull sharki ibefore i try againi ii have the opportunity to discoveri iexactly what the breede river bull sharks are doingi ithat sets them apart from bull sharks in other riversi iwe head out to track the shark that i caught and releasedi ithe acoustic tagi iwhich we secured to the back of the sharki itransmits a signali iwhich we hear as a ping on our hydrophonei ithe clearer the sound the closer the sharki its up its up wade yeah so a bit further up yeah all right maybe the hint*****************something we might be just out of the main range iwe end up miles upriver in search of the tagged sharki man shouting indistinctly what apparently the guy there just said you mustnt catch sharks here cause we swim here um im not quite sure what the logic of that is chuckles i think you know whether we catch them or not theyre here apparently the big one last year was tracked right past these houses on several occasions yeah meanwhile the one were looking for at the moment no sign or shall i say no sound of it iwe turn and retrace our steps back downriveri isearching as we goi ieventually we come across a group of fishing*****************ijust off witsandi ia couple of fishermeni ihave just had a very close encounter with a sharki teeth marks there teeth there teeth there just trying to get a look at that man he had him in its mouth ithe shark tried to steal their catch as they brought it ini iso i know theres a shark here and its hungryi pinging wade ah theres a beep already yeah iwe found the tagged shark that i released yesterdayi so were straight ahead so its actually oh oh ithe hydrophone signal peaks at 100i iso means the shark is within yards of our boati slightly worried about having my hands close to the water now pinging there we go according*****************the hydrophone the fish is being you know right under that boat im just listening to the beats and looking at the screen and then when i get the strongest signal i hold it here i look up and its just pointing straight at the boat ithe breede river bull sharksi ihave learned to shadow fishing boatsi iwaiting for fish to be hooked then taking them off the linei iits very specific systematic behaviori ithere are no records of bull sharks doing thisi ianywhere else in the worldi iand i just witnessed it firsthandi iits like a protection paymenti ithe sharks steal a percentage of the fishermens catchi iand in exchange they leave humans alone i iat least for*****************normally one of the first things youve got to do is actually locate the fish but it appears that here even though weve got a lot of water i dont have to go looking for the shark theyre gonna come looking for me ito many its the stuff of nightmares i ia heavily populated riveri ithats also home to massive hungry bull sharksi ibut can i make this worki for imei iand catch myself a monsteri imy plan is to position myself right next to the fishermeni iand let the sharks come to mei yep lots of activity on the river today thats gonna get the sharks quite excited ii set up seven miles upriveri iin a spot close*****************where the team landedi ithe big female shark last year i ibut well away from this years tagged sharki iwhich was last located near the river mouthi ithe tracking team are out searching for him right nowi theres boats generally around the river i think the sharks today are gonna be active this is their big feeding day this is when the humans come and do the work for them ithe biggest bull shark ever recordedi iwas caught in this riveri iand im determined to catch anotheri ithen the tracking boat appearsi oh no right meaghens making signs like this its checking us out yeah it looks like the tagged shark is actually around the boat and i had*****************frustrating its just proving so hard to keep away from that tagged shark its just covering such an area of water its right behind us now and we just popped it in when we arrived here this is actually one of the favored spots all clear and you know about five minutes after anchoring were getting a signal the sharks right under the boat catching it again would not be a good idea because at the moment weve got a stable situation it comes along its taking fish from fishermans boats and everybodys happy the fishermen arent too happy but that is its main or important source of food if anything actually makes the sharks wary of fish near boats they could start feeding in a more opportunistic way which you know might not be good news for the people around here so very important to avoid hooking that fish*****************iif i hook the same shark again or if anyone else doesi iit may become wary of its normal food sourcei iand start searching for other preyi iwe move on once againi iwere learning so muchi iabout the behavior of the bull sharks in this riveri ithat the scientists are desperate for mei ito make another catchi ithe capture of the male sharki itold us that theyre probably here to feedi pinging iand the tracking showed usi ithat theyre actively following fishing boatsi ifor an easy supply of foodi icatching another big onei iwould confirm the breede river as home of the monster sharksi reel clicking iive left the tagged shark several miles upriveri iand set up just off*****************town of witsandi this is what i use for goliath tigerfish nile perch things like that 80-pound line so a big shark on here would be very interesting i might just try pulling the bait a little bit if theres a predator watching sometimes just a little bit of movement its thinking about it its thinking do i want it dont i want it but its got time to think about it if you move it suddenly it can be like a reflex bang theyll hit it something had a go yeah wait a minute the balloon is gone one two three ithis could be the monster i came here fori it knows its hooked now this feels a*****************fish oh wait a minute whats happened there its running its running its running ionly a shark in this river runs with this power and speedi ibut ive got a problemi oh wait a minute whats happened there suddenly went slack no thats round something thats round something ah its actually snagged iive already lost one shark to a broken linei ii dont want to lose anotheri i can still feel the fish if we can go back mark just get it off that snag whatever it is this is not good i think were clear i think were clear oh the line is a bit shredded there oh that line is in a bad way ithis shark has*****************the linei iround some debris on the bottomi iand even though it hasnt gone throughi iits very badly frayedi im only on about i dont know might only be strength on the line imy line is wearing throughi ibut if i try to bring the shark in too quicklyi ii could lose iti im just so nervous cause i know the lines not in good way ione hour and one mile further upriveri a friend of mine whos caught bull sharks said to me bull sharks its not like a mako shark which is a real speed merchant a bull shark is very solid very muscular itll just like take you for a walk i feel like a 6-year-old*****************taking a rottweiler for a walk iit feels bigger and stronger than the other sharki its just getting more lively all of a sudden its right under the bow if we can go left all right okay ithree miles from where i hooked the sharki iand its still pulling the boati people who say catching fish doesnt cause any pain theyre wrong my back is killing me not to mention where the rod butt is jammed oh dear its gonna be an interesting color after the end of all this ias the hours passi ithe shark continues to drag the boat up the riveri this is totally not normal in a river i had a giant stingray on for*****************hours but weve gone past that it must be now ithe fight is now heading towards its third houri ithe shark has taken the boat and me four miles upriveri it might come up it might come up coming towards the surface - reel clicking - thats the tail thats the fish dorsal and tail dorsal and tail first time its broken the surface its gonna show again reel clicking thats the dorsal ah wait its under the boat back please back back back back back back thats the last here we go right now absolute concentration if i say let go just let go all right okay grunts ithe gaff is necessary to hold the head upi ibut*****************barely punctures the tough skini bloody hell its not really gaffed is it this is gonna break the gaff its gonna break the bloody gaff ithis shark has battled with me for hoursi iand dragged the boat five miles up the riveri get to the back i think mccord we just need to get to the back you guys need to get off never had a fight anywhere like that long before thats almost double the longest fight i had with a freshwater stingray and those things just glue themselves to the bottom wow chuckles mccord pull wade the gaffs now out ithis bull shark is definitely largeri ithan the last one i caughti iwell keep it alive while*****************team take samplesi imeasure it and insert the acoustic tagi ithen get it back into the riveri sharks can actually pump water over their gills so im wedging the mouth open with a bit of wood and just shoving water in its mouth iits another male bull shark i i910 long and more than pounds i ithe biggest fish ive ever caughti iand one of the largest male bull sharks ever landedi tags are there samples taken parasites all the rest of it very quick operation but this thing having been so strong for so long is now just feeling a bit like i am so we just need to get it revived isharks trigger a primal fear like*****************otheri iand even though its utterly exhaustedi iafter fighting with me for nearly four hoursi ithis bull shark can still prompt a nervous run for landi mccord laughs itwo catches proving that last years shark was not a flukei iand that the breede river is homei ito some of the largest bull sharks anywhere in the worldi when i first came here i never imagined that what we would find out would take the investigation so far forward and actually provide likely answers to some of the big questions about the sharks in this river it seems that they come here during the warmer months of the year to feed but its not a random feeding strategy instead of*****************energy by chasing free-swimming fish theyre actually taking their food from anglers lines like plucking fruit from a tree its a very efficient way of feeding and perhaps this explains why the sharks in this river are so big this easy food source also possibly explains why there have never been any attacks on humans and as long as the numbers of those small fish remain healthy this remarkable coexistence between humans and potential man-eaters should continue,the bull shark carcharhinus leucas also known as the zambezi shark informally zambi in africa and lake nicaragua shark in nicaragua is a species of requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm shallow waters along coasts and in rivers it is known for its aggressive nature and presence mainly in warm shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and usually lower reaches of rivers their aggressive nature has led to ongoing shark-culling efforts near beaches to protect beachgoers which is one of the causes of bull shark populations continuing to decrease bull sharks are listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list bull sharks are euryhaline and can thrive in both salt and fresh water they are known to travel far up rivers and have been known to travel up the mississippi river as far as alton illinois about kilometres mi from the ocean but few freshwater interactions with humans*****************been recorded larger-sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of nearshore shark attacks including many incidents of shark bites attributed to other species unlike the river sharks of the genus glyphis bull sharks are not true freshwater sharks despite their ability to survive in freshwater habitats this shark appears in the image of the colones bill from costa rica etymology the name bull shark comes from the sharks stocky shape broad flat snout and aggressive unpredictable behavior in india the bull shark may be confused with the sundarbans or ganges shark in africa it is also commonly called the zambezi river shark or just zambi its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names*****************ganges river shark fitzroy creek whaler van rooyens shark lake nicaragua shark river shark freshwater whaler estuary whaler swan river whaler cub shark and shovelnose shark evolution some of the bull sharks closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation its genus carcharhinus also includes the sandbar shark which is not capable of osmoregulation the bull shark shares numerous similarities with river sharks of the genus glyphis and other species in the genus carcharhinus but its phylogeny has not been cleared yet anatomy and appearance bull sharks are large and stout with females being larger than males the bull shark can be up to cm ft in in length at birth adult female bull sharks average m*****************long and typically weigh kg lb whereas the slightly smaller adult male averages m ft and kg lb while a maximum size of m ft is commonly reported a single record exists of a female specimen of exactly m ft a m ft long pregnant individual reached kg lb the maximum weight of the m ft long pregnant female can be over kg lb ranking it among the largest of the requiem sharks bull sharks are wider and heavier than other requiem sharks of comparable length and are grey on top and white

bull sharks have a bite force up to newtons lbf weight for weight the highest among all investigated cartilaginous fishes exceptional specimens in early june off the coast of the florida keys near the western part of the atlantic ocean a female believed to measure at least m ft and kg lb was caught by members of the rj dunlap marine conservation program in the arabian sea off the coast of fujairah in the united arab emirates a pregnant shark weighing kg lb and measuring m ft long was caught in february followed by another specimen weighing about kg lb and measuring about the same in length in january unconfirmed*****************suggest that the very largest exceptional specimens can possibly weigh up to kg lb distribution and habitat the bull shark is commonly found worldwide in coastal areas of warm oceans in rivers and lakes and occasionally salt and freshwater streams if they are deep enough it is found to a depth of m ft but does not usually swim deeper than m ft in the atlantic it is found from massachusetts to southern brazil and from morocco to angola populations of bull sharks are also found in several major rivers with more than bull sharks thought to be living in the brisbane river one was reportedly seen swimming the flooded streets of brisbane queensland australia during the queensland floods*****************were sighted in one of the main streets of goodna queensland shortly after the peak of the january floods a large bull shark was caught in the canals of scarborough just north of brisbane within moreton bay still greater numbers are in the canals of the gold coast queensland in the warmer months of the year bull sharks frequent sydney harbour in the pacific ocean it can be found from baja california to ecuador the bull shark has traveled km mi up the amazon river to iquitos in peru and north bolivia it also lives in freshwater lake nicaragua in the ganges and brahmaputra rivers of west bengal and assam in eastern india and adjoining bangladesh it can live*****************water with a high salt content as in st lucia estuary in south africa bull sharks have been recorded in the tigris river since at least as far upriver as baghdad and has been rumored to also inhabit the cahora bassa lake upstream of the zambezi the species has a distinct preference for warm currents after hurricane katrina many bull sharks were sighted in lake pontchartrain in july some local fishermen in the atchafalaya river have reported increasing numbers bull sharks have occasionally gone as far upstream in the mississippi river as alton illinois bull sharks have also been found in the potomac river in st marys county maryland from to a golf course lake at carbrook logan city*****************australia was the home to several bull sharks they were trapped following a flood of the logan and albert rivers in and resided in the acres ha lake until when they disappeared after another series of floods the golf course capitalized on the novelty changing their logo to feature the sharks and hosting a monthly tournament called the shark lake challenge behavior freshwater tolerance the bull shark is the best known of species of elasmobranch across genera and four families to have been reported in fresh andor brackish water other species that enter rivers include the stingrays dasyatidae potamotrygonidae and others and sawfish pristidae some skates rajidae smooth dogfishes triakidae and sandbar sharks carcharhinus plumbeus regularly enter estuaries the*****************shark is diadromous meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease as they are euryhaline fishable to quickly adapt to a wide range of salinities thus the bull shark is one of the few cartilaginous fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems many of the euryhaline fish are bony fishes such as salmon or tilapia and are not closely related to bull sharks evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect with one being that the bull shark experienced a population bottleneck during the last ice age this bottleneck may have separated the bull shark from the rest of the elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system*****************ability to enter fresh water is limited because their blood is normally at least as salty in terms of osmotic strength as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood despite this the solute composition ie osmolarity of a bull shark in fresh water is still much higher than that of the external environment this results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the sharks body however bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance these are the rectal gland*****************liver and gills all elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland thereby conserving sodium and chloride the kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine but also play an important role in the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood the gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters*****************in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters this may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy bull sharks are able to regulate themselves to live in either fresh or salt water it can live in fresh water for its entire life but this does not happen mostly due to the reproductive needs of the shark young bull sharks leave the brackish water in which they are born and move out into the sea to breed while is theoretically possible for bull sharks to live purely in*****************water experiments conducted on bull sharks found that they died within four years the stomach was opened and all that was found were two small unidentifiable fishes the cause of death could have been starvation since the primary food source for bull sharks resides in salt water in a research experiment the bull sharks were found to be at the mouth of an estuary for the majority of the time they stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water the driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water however is its age as the bull shark ages its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases the majority*****************the newborn or very young bull sharks were found in the freshwater area whereas the much older bull sharks were found to be in the saltwater areas as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity reproduction is one of the reasons why adult bull sharks travel into the riverit is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival and a way to increase overall fitness of bull sharks the young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out initially scientists thought the sharks in lake nicaragua belonged to an endemic species the lake nicaragua shark*****************nicaraguensis in following specimen comparisons taxonomists synonymized them bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean and vice versa with some taking as few as seven to days to complete the journey a study of six bull sharks confined to a stagnant golf course lake in brisbane australia from to uncovered their adaptability to low-salinity environments marking the longest recorded residency for the species under such conditions and demonstrating their ability to live indefinitely in low-salinity aquatic environments diet the bull shark is a marine apex predator capable of taking a variety of prey the bull sharks diet consists mainly of bony fish and small sharks including other bull sharks and stingrays their*****************can also include turtles birds dolphins terrestrial mammals crustaceans and echinoderms they hunt in murky waters where it is harder for the prey to see the shark coming bull sharks have been known to use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey after the first initial contact they continue to bite and tackle prey until the prey is unable to flee the bull shark is a solitary hunter though may briefly pair with another bull shark to make hunting and tricking prey easier sharks are opportunistic feeders and the bull shark is no exception to this as it is part of the carcharhinus family of sharks normally sharks eat in short bursts and when food is scarce sharks digest*****************a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation as part of their survival mechanism bull sharks will regurgitate the food in their stomachs in order to escape from a predator this is a distraction tactic if the predator moves to eat the regurgitated food the bull shark can use the opportunity to escape reproduction bull sharks mate during late summer and early autumn often in bays and estuaries after gestating for months a bull shark may give birth to to live young they are viviparous born live and free-swimming the young are about cm in at birth the bull shark does not rear its young the young bull sharks are born into flat protected areas coastal*****************river mouths and other low-salinity estuaries are common nursery habitats the male bull shark is able to begin reproducing around the age of years while the female cannot begin reproducing until the age of years the size of a fully matured female bull shark to produce viable eggs for fertilization seems to be cm to cm the courting routine between bull sharks has not been observed in detail as of yet the male likely bites the female on the tail until she can turn upside down and the male can copulate at that point mature females commonly have scratches from the mating process interactions with humans since bull sharks often dwell in very shallow waters are found in many*****************of habitats are territorial by nature and have no tolerance for provocation they may be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark bull sharks are one of the three shark species along with the tiger shark and great white shark most likely to bite humans one or several bull sharks may have been responsible for the jersey shore shark attacks of while it is a common misconception that these attacks were the inspiration for the novel jaws its author peter benchley has stated this is not the case the speculation that bull sharks may have been responsible is based on two fatal bites occurring in brackish and fresh water bull sharks have attacked swimmers around the*****************harbour inlets in india bull sharks swim up the ganges bramaputra mahanadi and other indian rivers and have bitten bathers many of these bite incidents were attributed to the ganges shark glyphis gangeticus a critically endangered river shark species although the sand tiger shark was also blamed during the 1960s and 1970s bull sharks have also attacked humans off the coast of florida visual cues behavioral studies have confirmed that sharks can take visual cues to discriminate between different objects the bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater it was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water*****************yellow mesh netting was found to be easily avoided when it was placed in the path of the bull shark this was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black energy conservation in researchers tagged and recorded the movements of young bull sharks in the caloosahatchee river estuary they were testing to find out what determined the movement of the young bull sharks it was found that the young bull sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed this large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators the movement was found*****************be directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself one way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes the bull shark uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment ecology humans are the biggest threat to bull sharks larger sharks such as the tiger shark and great white shark may attack them but typically only target juveniles crocodiles may be a threat to bull sharks in rivers saltwater crocodiles have been observed preying on bull sharks in the rivers and estuaries of*****************australia and a nile crocodile was reportedly sighted consuming a bull shark in south africa conservation the bull shark is listed as a vulnerable species on the iucn red list and its population is decreasing despite its status the species isnt named as a protected species threats to the bull shark are numerous such as getting caught in fishing nets overfishing for their oil skin and meat pollution to their habitat and more in many areas of the world including australia and south africa there are shark-culling measures around beaches to prevent attacks on beach-goers researchers tried to fix the problem of sharks getting too close to land by testing out a device called the sharksafe barriertm this barrier*****************magnetic and visual stimuli which utilized rows of piping to create a continuous magnetic field to deter the sharks however researchers concluded that the technology needs to be improved and tested further before it can be implemented as a reliable safety measure other research is being conducted to come up with conservation solutions for the bull sharks one example is the nature conservancy satellite tagging

jungle killer,wolf fish,hoplias aimara,thunder crashes my name is jeremy wade and i hunt monsters river monsters im always on the alert for new information new leads and new investigations ive received a tantalizing report its a story about a fish apparently attacking a diver now there are frustratingly few details and thats no wonder because this story comes from a remote country in south america a country called suriname but from what ive heard this is not the work of south americas most notorious river monster the piranha so what is it can there really be a fish that pound-for-pound can challenge the piranha here we go for the title of the most ferocious river monster of south america theres only one way to find out wade in pursuit of river monsters i travel to the four corners of the globe suriname is one place ive never had cause to visit until now ive come to investigate the possibility that although everyone knows the notorious piranha there may be a fish out here that has an even more fearsome reputation suriname is south americas best-kept secret it is the smallest country on the continent with a population of only half a million people but it can boast the largest continuous area of unspoiled rainforest in the world once a dutch colony it is a true melting pot of nationalities and cultures the majority of the sparse population live along the coast so the deeper into the country you go the further you are from the civilized world i have been to remote places before but this is of a new order if things go wrong out here there is little hope of being rescued but first i have to meet the victim in the story the man who was attacked by this mystery fish ive arranged to meet him where the attack happened at the dam two hours out of the capital paramaribo wade the dam was built on the suriname river and completed in creating one of the largest man-made lakes in the world called brokopondo on the banks of which i meet morris gantz a local man of dutch decent what was your job on the dam at the time this was definitely not a piranha attack they rush in snatching quick savage bites they dont cling onto their victims like a dog with a bone morris mutilated hand needed over stitches and even though it was years ago he still very much bears the scars thats the scar here its hard to believe theres a freshwater fish that would launch a solo attack on a diver did you know what fish it was wade anjumara also known as the wolffish so-called for its wolf like teeth these fish can grow to nearly feet and weigh pounds they are serious predators but i had until now never heard of one ever attacking a person i wonder if morris ever had any other kind of close encounter while he was diving did that make you slightly nervous they never came and took a nip out of any no no no no no so morris often saw piranhas but they never ever came close unlike this lone wolf wade this fish attacked and if morris hadnt had his knife who knows what could have happened could it be that the wolffish is more dangerous than the more notorious south-american horror the piranha to find out i need to confront one myself i wonder if morris monster still haunts this river from experience many river monsters have little regard for our modern world ive caught them near dams and in cities would this monster be any different the attack on morris was years ago and as far as im aware nothing like that has happened in this place since and also this place seems to be comparatively developed so im not really sure if this is where i should be looking i persevere through the night but with no luck wade in the morning i head back into town to paramaribo surinames capital city i need to find out where wolffish can be found i head downtown to the fish market to try my luck this looks like a small anjumara small wolffish speaking native language small is it ah yeah yeah i understand i understand this one isnt actually the anjumara this is a small relative called here the pataka ive caught something very similar to this maybe actually the same as this in brazil those teeth are probably almost as vicious as a piranhas and theyre also very slippery its like a bar of soap with teeth the big one is a sort of scaled-up version of this which is what were looking for the wolffish im hunting are times larger than these there are no wolffish here but i dont leave empty-handed ive been told of an old retired anjumara fisherman who lives in town maybe he can tell me where i can find one of these monsters his name is fritz van der bosch he shows me his old wolffish gear so this is very strong line it may be outdated but its an impressive rig and as we settle down to chat he tells me of his own strange experience of being attacked by a wolffish yes so your leg was out of the water laughs wade this story really puts the wolffish into a different league i have never heard of a fish trying to attack someone on land before and theres another more chilling story reptilian monsters like anacondas and gators are known to snatch dogs from the waters edge but a fish now im even more determined to find a wolffish but it sounds like what you need to do now is go a long way away so now you cant just do a short fishing trip you have to make an expedition sure okay wade it seems that people have driven out this aquatic wolf it now exists only beyond civilization to take it on im now preparing to travel deep into surinames wild interior usually there are signs of human habitation dotted around but out here there is nothing i once survived a plane crash in brazil and was lucky enough to walk to a nearby town but out here i wouldnt stand a chance the landing strip is the only clear patch of forest i have seen for nearly two hours i wonder just what ive got myself into pieter sonneveld has a european name but is surinamese he will help me talk with the local people so i can collate any wolffish stories from this area wade on the ground the rainforest is as impressive as it is from the air but our isolation is even more apparent not only are the heat and humidity oppressive but our little group are possibly the only human beings in thousands of acres of tangled rainforest at night this place takes on an even more sinister character animals calling well it looks like were just about here but im not totally sure where here is but it does sound like theres some serious water over here somewhere but im gonna have to wait until the morning to see exactly what im up against in all my years of fishing this could be the most unspoiled and remote river that ive ever fished the mighty corentyne river is miles long and surinames largest for most of its length it is completely uninhabited and rarely explored wade the river is punctuated by frequent crushing rapids and deep turbulent pools there are vast granite boulders everywhere some just under the water others creating waterfalls there are so many different fishing holes that i take every opportunity to get a bait or lure in the river to cover as much water as i can different types of fish prefer different parts of the river having never hunted for wolffish here i need to explore every likely fishing spot to see if i can discover the monsters lair im using my short bait caster rod for accuracy to get my eye in although it looks lightweight this beauty with its strong braided line is capable of landing fish over pounds but there are more than just wolffish here the corentyne is also home to the red-eye piranha one of the largest of its kind this river really is the best place to compare these two toothy south american monsters thats a fish on fish on hey fish off growls suddenly im getting action every cast aah when you get these things in they are just so well-hooked and yet sometimes you hook one and somehow it just manages to get rid of the hooks thats quite dramatic though short but very very dramatic thats one on thats one on lets see if i can keep this one but is this a wolffish i havent seen the fish yet that is a piranha in the back foul-hooked always feels bigger exhales sharply monster piranha that is black in color wade just by looking at one you can understand the piranhas reputation but ive done experiments using myself as a guinea pig and ive concluded that theyre only dangerous to people in extreme circumstances for piranhas the mob rules its death by cuts and for that they have no equal but im comparing wolffish with piranhas one against one and having now seen the piranhas they have to compete with im even more wary about meeting a wolffish i wonder if like wolves the fish im after are nocturnal hunters so i continue fishing into the night but its too risky to move around there are too many hazards and dangers that could send me into the dark water so i change tactics and stick to the shore im fishing with a big bait cast into the stream fish on but its just another monster piranha hes supposed to be asleep now but theres always one theres always one eh its november and the rainy season is fast approaching carbon-fiber rods make excellent lightning conductors i dont know how long i can stay out here luckily something picks up the bait it feels big much bigger than anything ive hooked so far the question is do i have one on the end of my line all right this is a new species for here thats a red-tailed catfish thats about the size of what i want but its the wrong species the local name for these fish is the motro tejalie which translates as motor car on account of all the noises they make when out of the water oops red-tailed catfish its another species thats active at night not what i was after but its quite interesting just to see a bit of variety here its a familiar species to me but in a different part of south america bit of excitement but the wrong kind of excitement thunder crashes animals calling wade after several more days of trying with no success my guide pieter suggests we visit the only village in the area and talk with the locals to see if they can give us the information that we need the tiriyo tribes village at amatopo has no more than huts it is their only settlement on the corentyne river they live with the wolffish so they know it better than anyone im hoping they will share some of its secrets with me how dangerous exactly is the anjumara speaking native language yateo was hunting and he came to a creek near here called mosquito creek and there was a troop of monkeys crossing the creek speaking native language they were going to the furthest branch on one side jumping across onto the furthest branch the other side and the whole group of monkeys had jumped apart from the last one one missed the branch landed in the water as soon as it hit the water it was attacked by a wolffish and killed suddenly the stories come thick and fast so somebody was actually bitten on the arm that speaks of a real sort of aggression yateos uncle was hunting one day with his dog dog barking the hunting dogs when theyre hunting theyre barking barking barking barking continues yateos uncle found his dog dead in the creek with its stomach ripped open and theres now another incident of somebody getting bitten in this case on the thumb so its another two animals to add to the list snakes swimming on the surface and just being taken from below theres a type of bird called an anamu this is a bird that comes to the water to drink and likewise thats just grabbed by one of these fish just lurking there in ambush hes sort of you know wary about getting in the water sometimes speaking native language people outside south america they know all about piranhas now locally wolffish this is a fish with a very big reputation its known to be very aggressive and there are certain circumstances where they will literally rip anything apart that goes near them reptiles birds primates even people speaking native language wade after listening to the tiriyo tribe its clear that having the weaponry is one thing having the attitude is quite another the wolffish is well equipped with both but one thing still eludes me where do you find them salamoni agrees to take me fishing but its like no fishing ive done before straightaway we do something i wasnt expecting salamoni leads me to a narrow creek one that no one has been through for some time we then take to the land and creep through the jungle looks like were following the course of sort of a dried-up subcreek so the chances are theres going to be a bit of a junction here that does look like the kind of place where you might find fish wade he fishes with a bow and arrow the way his ancestors have for centuries hes stringing the bow just getting the tension in the bow salamoni calling wade this is mimicking the sound of a water bird so theres a little bit of disturbance on the surface a little bit of whistling the idea is this calls the wolffish in calling continues i dont know if its coincidence or what but ive just seen movement on the surface which looked very much like a wolffish oh yes yes yes yes arrow fires oh its on wade he missed it but it has given me the last piece of this puzzle one thing very very striking that fish when it came in that was in very shallow water not just that very very tangly water so this isnt a monster of the deep this is a monster sometimes of the shallows the fishing with a line is gonna be very close quarters and also these snags are going to present a real problem not just in terms of getting a bait to a place where the fish can take it but also if i get a heavy fish on extracting it from all this stuff you know its going to be very challenging and who knows that might even be at night so this is going to be quite some fishing i decide to have a go myself using the gear im accustomed to wade im now using my larger fixed-spool reel and a big chunk of bait with a wire trace to stop any sharp teeth from biting through im also trying to make some disturbance on the surface like salamoni did to see if it will attract any hungry wolffish no takes on the bait no reaction to the popper looks a good spot but doesnt seem to be anything at home weve reached the end of the navigable stretch of this creek now its just this impenetrable tangle of branches now so if we were to hack our way through there wed just disturb everything and you could hardly get a bait into the water anyway very very interesting fishing on our way back to the village on the main river conditions are changing it may be nothing to worry about this black cloud here because the weather in the tropics it can be very localized you can see a storm over in one direction maybe it comes your way you get wet maybe it goes somewhere else but it seems to have passed us by or so i think wade with nothing for the pot salamoni takes me on a detour to catch some fish for dinner think this could be our spot here so off the rocks theres gonna be a nice slack with eddies happening on the other side but out on this exposed island in the middle of the river we are about to discover just how changeable and dangerous conditions are in the rainforest this is a classic example of pure fishing in a way its starting with absolutely nothing just coming down with a couple of rods no bait and just poking around in these cracks to find crabs and a crab is pulled to pieces and thats where we start from hopefully we turn that thunder crashes man bleep me should i take this off wade i would i would that lightning strike salamoni was standing in the water he actually felt a shock got a shock through the water abandoning were getting into the boat and were going i thought wed all escaped that lightning strike the sound man on my crew didnt our sound recordist has been hit was actually struck on the head by that bolt of lightning chris are you okay are you responding good good good good we might need some first aid here lets go quick quick quick how are you feeling all right were moving away from the storm thats good right rubber soles rubber soles rubber soles good wade ive got a bit of a headache james who is behind the camera at the moment has got a headache i think it might have actually hit all three of us chris definitely got the brunt of it very very lucky for him he was actually wearing thick rubber-soled boots so hes conscious which is a huge relief were arriving back at the camp wade i suspect that the lightning bolt actually struck very close to where we were all standing we all felt the effects of the strike but chris was obviously the closest the remoteness of our location is now even more apparent but thankfully chris condition continues to improve and within hours he is once more back on his feet and eager to get me fishing again if you just tell me again how far from here were going that night pieter lays out his plans for us to head even deeper into the jungle to try and reach some creeks that he believes will be the best places for us to catch a wolffish but it will mean camping and being self-sufficient for several days in a place even more remote with all that has happened it is a brave plan and we decide to sleep on it but i discuss it with the crew and theres really only one decision im actually going even more remote if such a thing is possible i figure that if im gonna find a big wolffish im gonna need to go somewhere where even the tiriyo dont normally go the sheer size of the corentyne river is humbling in places it is over two miles wide a confusion of tangled islands channels rocky outcrops and narrow rapids we are using a local boatman called bona who knows the river well without him i would quickly become lost in this watery maze the jungle echoes with eerie calls and cries but it is too impenetrable to reveal the creatures making the noise animals calling three hours later and with nothing but endless rainforest on either bank we arrive at our new base camp its a collection of small tents on a sandbar on an island in the middle of nowhere from here i will carry out my campaign to catch a wolffish i waste no time getting ready and before the sun sets we head out to the nearest creek to get our bearings wolffish it seems head up creeks during the wet season dispersing into the flooded forest but as the water recedes they are forced back down towards the main river it is then that they are their easiest to find im here in what should be the lowest water levels of the year but straightaway it is apparent the conditions are not ideal very much mixed feelings on arriving at the camp the thing that struck me immediately was that the water level is probably about two foot up on what wed hoped for what wed expected and what is ideal for catching the wolffish basically what that means is that the creeks are gonna be that much fuller so the fish arent gonna be concentrated theyre gonna be spread up the creek they wont be as hungry they wont be as aggressive so catching them is likely to be harder than i expected wade i have now heard incredible stories of how fearless wolffish are i have caught the huge piranha that they compete with in these rivers i have traveled so far and risked so much that to fall at the last hurdle would be a disaster this creek is a really eerie place a pool enclosed by rainforest in the heart of nowhere i have never felt so tiny and remote the fragility of my safety has never been so clear and to make matters worse im not alone a caiman south americas alligator large ones have been known to attack people although normally quite wary this one is completely unafraid of me testament to how far from people ive traveled i dont want him to come too close but its no wonder he has made this creek his home its piranha buzz off aah its alive with piranhas actually very frustrating every bait im throwing out is getting attacked but unfortunately its by piranhas ah piranha again im hoping that as the light fades they will become less active but at the moment ive got a dwindling supply of bait because the piranhas are just attacking it every time my best chance is to wait until night wade salamoni told me that once the sun sets the piranhas run and hide because thats when the wolffish come out to hunt it seems that piranhas know who the real river monster is fish on oh yeah i finally got a wolffish on my line but im not the only one with an eye on my catch theres a caiman right in front of me i do the only thing i can think of im gonna try and just pull this up on the side with the worst possible result oh bleep bleep bleep i was trying to pull the fish up on the side because the caiman was after it and ive lost it ive lost it damn should have had that fish if that caiman hadnt been there id have probably had that fish what i was trying to do was just slide it out on the side here hook came out grunts damn i cant risk going back even though i know wolffish are there caiman are territorial and it was certainly not afraid of me it will be there again tomorrow without doubt and next time it might not just go for the fish a 7-foot caiman could easily attack and a severe injury out here would have serious ramifications but morning gives us another problem rain the storm makes me and the whole crew nervous we are nearing the end of the dry season when the rainy season starts two things will happen first the creeks will flood and the fish already hard to find will disappear into flooded forest making them impossible to catch second and possibly more important we could become stranded the airstrip is upstream and its our only way home if the water gets too high and fast we will not be able to get out its a sobering thought and it makes me look as much to the sky as i do to the water and i certainly dont want to test the theory that lightning never strikes the same place twice the new creek that im targeting is much narrower and even more surrounded with snags and tangles than the previous one oh its off groans nothing seems to be going my way all my previous luck seems to have run out just putting bait on here not getting any response to artificial so im putting a lump of piranha on theres been a couple of fish actually moving in here one right underneath this tangle of branches so its fishing right in the middle of snags in a place like this if it gets even a few feet its wrapped itself around a branch so i give it just enough line to take the bait properly and then its just try and haul it to the boat theres been nothing moving here now for quite a while so i think what ill do ill go further up the creek and maybe drop in here later nothing doing here at the moment wade the only option left is to enter this creek at night with half-hidden roots and fallen trees navigating this waterway is a disaster waiting to happen and it seems every creek has its caiman to make matter worse i hear a rumble of thunder thunder crashes my window of opportunity is about to slam shut this could be my last chance to catch a wolffish oh wait wait wait wait wait oh off off off no that could have been a piranha that took it into a snag i think it could be time to call it a night these things are very active at the moment wade with the storm edging ever closer and hungry piranha seemingly beating any wolffish to my bait im considering calling it a night but then i make a discovery wait a minute ive got a scale here ive got a scale that looks like a small wolffish the storm is closing in but so are the wolffish i decide to fish on thunder rumbles here we go here we go finally a strong take its a wolffish the monster ive spent the past three weeks trying to catch and its a big one over she comes ah fantastic here we go theres the result thats lovely so here we are this is the wolffish the stories ive heard about these absolutely fearless anything comes near them dogs people theyll go for it it looks quite gap-toothed but actually pull those lips back and you see there are very spiky fangs underneath there the other thing about it is the fishing is just unlike anything ive done before its real guerilla close quarters hand-to-hand combat almost wade my quest for the wolffish has pushed me to my limits damn it seems appropriate that ive had to push deeper and deeper into the greatest rainforest in the world to find the most savage and untamed river monster to date the piranha gets all the press but this guy delivers the goods its well-armed with a fearsome set of teeth but its also fiery and fearless attacking animals and people even out of the water and im convinced this is the fish that possibly pound for pound is the toughest most monstrous fish of south america there it is the wolffish,hoplias aimara also known as anjumara traira trahira manjuma anjoemara and giant wolf fish is a species of freshwater fish found in the rivers of south america in amazonia the native populations are concerned by high levels of mercury contamination which have been linked to the consumption of contaminated fish h aimara is a good bioindicator of such contamination description this is the largest of the hoplias species with specimens caught at a length of cm in the largest rod and reel record stands at cm in they can weigh as much as kg lb this species has an elongated cylindrical shape the colour is basically brown with a lighter base colour although shades can vary with a number of vertical patches or stripes there are normally small spots visible on the upper anterior part of the body including the head the patterning can vary geographically the colour can be almost solid black through to pale brownish gold colour with marked dark stripes although it seems docile the fish has been known to attack divers and swimmers however there is rarely a fatal ending taxonomy there were thought to be two species of giant trahiras hoplias aimara valenciennes and hoplias macrophthalmus pellegrin each described from french guiana study of the type-specimens of each species showed that both names h aimara and h macrophthalmus referred to the same taxon the principle of priority of the international code of zoological nomenclature therefore means that the name hoplias aimara has precedence distribution habitat and ecology across most of northern south

the majority of the sparse population live along the coast so the deeper into the country you go the further you are from the civilized world i have been to remote places before but this is of a new order if things*****************wrong out here there is little hope of being rescued but first i have to meet the victim in the story the man who was attacked by this mystery fish ive arranged to meet him where the attack happened at the dam two hours out of the capital paramaribo wade the dam was built on the suriname river and completed in creating one of the largest man-made lakes in the world called brokopondo on the banks of which i meet morris gantz a local man of dutch decent what was your job on the dam at the time this was definitely not a piranha attack they rush in snatching quick savage bites they dont cling onto their victims like*****************dog with a bone morris mutilated hand needed over stitches and even though it was years ago he still very much bears the scars thats the scar here its hard to believe theres a freshwater fish that would launch a solo attack on a diver did you know what fish it was wade anjumara also known as the wolffish so-called for its wolf like teeth these fish can grow to nearly feet and weigh pounds they are serious predators but i had until now never heard of one ever attacking a person i wonder if morris ever had any other kind of close encounter while he was diving did that make you slightly nervous they never came and took*****************nip out of any no no no no no so morris often saw piranhas but they never ever came close unlike this lone wolf wade this fish attacked and if morris hadnt had his knife who knows what could have happened could it be that the wolffish is more dangerous than the more notorious south-american horror the piranha to find out i need to confront one myself i wonder if morris monster still haunts this river from experience many river monsters have little regard for our modern world ive caught them near dams and in cities would this monster be any different the attack on morris was years ago and as far as im aware nothing like that has*****************in this place since and also this place seems to be comparatively developed so im not really sure if this is where i should be looking i persevere through the night but with no luck wade in the morning i head back into town to paramaribo surinames capital city i need to find out where wolffish can be found i head downtown to the fish market to try my luck this looks like a small anjumara small wolffish speaking native language small is it ah yeah yeah i understand i understand this one isnt actually the anjumara this is a small relative called here the pataka ive caught something very similar to this maybe actually the same as this*****************brazil those teeth are probably almost as vicious as a piranhas and theyre also very slippery its like a bar of soap with teeth the big one is a sort of scaled-up version of this which is what were looking for the wolffish im hunting are times larger than these there are no wolffish here but i dont leave empty-handed ive been told of an old retired anjumara fisherman who lives in town maybe he can tell me where i can find one of these monsters his name is fritz van der bosch he shows me his old wolffish gear so this is very strong line it may be outdated but its an impressive rig and as we settle*****************to chat he tells me of his own strange experience of being attacked by a wolffish yes so your leg was out of the water laughs wade this story really puts the wolffish into a different league i have never heard of a fish trying to attack someone on land before and theres another more chilling story reptilian monsters like anacondas and gators are known to snatch dogs from the waters edge but a fish now im even more determined to find a wolffish but it sounds like what you need to do now is go a long way away so now you cant just do a short fishing trip you have to make an expedition sure okay wade*****************seems that people have driven out this aquatic wolf it now exists only beyond civilization to take it on im now preparing to travel deep into surinames wild interior usually there are signs of human habitation dotted around but out here there is nothing i once survived a plane crash in brazil and was lucky enough to walk to a nearby town but out here i wouldnt stand a chance the landing strip is the only clear patch of forest i have seen for nearly two hours i wonder just what ive got myself into pieter sonneveld has a european name but is surinamese he will help me talk with the local people so i can collate any wolffish*****************from this area wade on the ground the rainforest is as impressive as it is from the air but our isolation is even more apparent not only are the heat and humidity oppressive but our little group are possibly the only human beings in thousands of acres of tangled rainforest at night this place takes on an even more sinister character animals calling well it looks like were just about here but im not totally sure where here is but it does sound like theres some serious water over here somewhere but im gonna have to wait until the morning to see exactly what im up against in all my years of fishing this could be the most unspoiled*****************remote river that ive ever fished the mighty corentyne river is miles long and surinames largest for most of its length it is completely uninhabited and rarely explored wade the river is punctuated by frequent crushing rapids and deep turbulent pools there are vast granite boulders everywhere some just under the water others creating waterfalls there are so many different fishing holes that i take every opportunity to get a bait or lure in the river to cover as much water as i can different types of fish prefer different parts of the river having never hunted for wolffish here i need to explore every likely fishing spot to see if i can discover the monsters lair im using*****************short bait caster rod for accuracy to get my eye in although it looks lightweight this beauty with its strong braided line is capable of landing fish over pounds but there are more than just wolffish here the corentyne is also home to the red-eye piranha one of the largest of its kind this river really is the best place to compare these two toothy south american monsters thats a fish on fish on hey fish off growls suddenly im getting action every cast aah when you get these things in they are just so well-hooked and yet sometimes you hook one and somehow it just manages to get rid of the hooks thats quite dramatic though short but*****************very dramatic thats one on thats one on lets see if i can keep this one but is this a wolffish i havent seen the fish yet that is a piranha in the back foul-hooked always feels bigger exhales sharply monster piranha that is black in color wade just by looking at one you can understand the piranhas reputation but ive done experiments using myself as a guinea pig and ive concluded that theyre only dangerous to people in extreme circumstances for piranhas the mob rules its death by cuts and for that they have no equal but im comparing wolffish with piranhas one against one and having now seen the piranhas they have to compete with im even*****************wary about meeting a wolffish i wonder if like wolves the fish im after are nocturnal hunters so i continue fishing into the night but its too risky to move around there are too many hazards and dangers that could send me into the dark water so i change tactics and stick to the shore im fishing with a big bait cast into the stream fish on but its just another monster piranha hes supposed to be asleep now but theres always one theres always one eh its november and the rainy season is fast approaching carbon-fiber rods make excellent lightning conductors i dont know how long i can stay out here luckily something picks up the bait it*****************big much bigger than anything ive hooked so far the question is do i have one on the end of my line all right this is a new species for here thats a red-tailed catfish thats about the size of what i want but its the wrong species the local name for these fish is the motro tejalie which translates as motor car on account of all the noises they make when out of the water oops red-tailed catfish its another species thats active at night not what i was after but its quite interesting just to see a bit of variety here its a familiar species to me but in a different part of south america bit of*****************but the wrong kind of excitement thunder crashes animals calling wade after several more days of trying with no success my guide pieter suggests we visit the only village in the area and talk with the locals to see if they can give us the information that we need the tiriyo tribes village at amatopo has no more than huts it is their only settlement on the corentyne river they live with the wolffish so they know it better than anyone im hoping they will share some of its secrets with me how dangerous exactly is the anjumara speaking native language yateo was hunting and he came to a creek near here called mosquito creek and there was a*****************of monkeys crossing the creek speaking native language they were going to the furthest branch on one side jumping across onto the furthest branch the other side and the whole group of monkeys had jumped apart from the last one one missed the branch landed in the water as soon as it hit the water it was attacked by a wolffish and killed suddenly the stories come thick and fast so somebody was actually bitten on the arm that speaks of a real sort of aggression yateos uncle was hunting one day with his dog dog barking the hunting dogs when theyre hunting theyre barking barking barking barking continues yateos uncle found his dog dead in the creek with*****************stomach ripped open and theres now another incident of somebody getting bitten in this case on the thumb so its another two animals to add to the list snakes swimming on the surface and just being taken from below theres a type of bird called an anamu this is a bird that comes to the water to drink and likewise thats just grabbed by one of these fish just lurking there in ambush hes sort of you know wary about getting in the water sometimes speaking native language people outside south america they know all about piranhas now locally wolffish this is a fish with a very big reputation its known to be very aggressive and there are certain*****************where they will literally rip anything apart that goes near them reptiles birds primates even people speaking native language wade after listening to the tiriyo tribe its clear that having the weaponry is one thing having the attitude is quite another the wolffish is well equipped with both but one thing still eludes me where do you find them salamoni agrees to take me fishing but its like no fishing ive done before straightaway we do something i wasnt expecting salamoni leads me to a narrow creek one that no one has been through for some time we then take to the land and creep through the jungle looks like were following the course of sort of a dried-up*****************so the chances are theres going to be a bit of a junction here that does look like the kind of place where you might find fish wade he fishes with a bow and arrow the way his ancestors have for centuries hes stringing the bow just getting the tension in the bow salamoni calling wade this is mimicking the sound of a water bird so theres a little bit of disturbance on the surface a little bit of whistling the idea is this calls the wolffish in calling continues i dont know if its coincidence or what but ive just seen movement on the surface which looked very much like a wolffish oh yes yes yes yes arrow*****************oh its on wade he missed it but it has given me the last piece of this puzzle one thing very very striking that fish when it came in that was in very shallow water not just that very very tangly water so this isnt a monster of the deep this is a monster sometimes of the shallows the fishing with a line is gonna be very close quarters and also these snags are going to present a real problem not just in terms of getting a bait to a place where the fish can take it but also if i get a heavy fish on extracting it from all this stuff you know its going to be very*****************and who knows that might even be at night so this is going to be quite some fishing i decide to have a go myself using the gear im accustomed to wade im now using my larger fixed-spool reel and a big chunk of bait with a wire trace to stop any sharp teeth from biting through im also trying to make some disturbance on the surface like salamoni did to see if it will attract any hungry wolffish no takes on the bait no reaction to the popper looks a good spot but doesnt seem to be anything at home weve reached the end of the navigable stretch of this creek now its just this impenetrable tangle of*****************now so if we were to hack our way through there wed just disturb everything and you could hardly get a bait into the water anyway very very interesting fishing on our way back to the village on the main river conditions are changing it may be nothing to worry about this black cloud here because the weather in the tropics it can be very localized you can see a storm over in one direction maybe it comes your way you get wet maybe it goes somewhere else but it seems to have passed us by or so i think wade with nothing for the pot salamoni takes me on a detour to catch some fish for dinner think*****************could be our spot here so off the rocks theres gonna be a nice slack with eddies happening on the other side but out on this exposed island in the middle of the river we are about to discover just how changeable and dangerous conditions are in the rainforest this is a classic example of pure fishing in a way its starting with absolutely nothing just coming down with a couple of rods no bait and just poking around in these cracks to find crabs and a crab is pulled to pieces and thats where we start from hopefully we turn that thunder crashes man bleep me should i take this off wade i would i would that lightning*****************away from the storm thats good right rubber soles rubber soles rubber soles good wade ive got a bit of a headache james who is behind the camera at the moment has got a headache i think it might have actually hit all three of us chris definitely got the brunt of it very very lucky for him he was actually wearing thick rubber-soled boots so hes conscious which is a huge relief were arriving back at the camp wade i suspect that the lightning bolt actually struck very close to where we were all standing we all felt the effects of the strike but chris was obviously the closest the remoteness of our location is now even more apparent but thankfully chris condition continues to improve and within hours he is once more back on his feet and eager to get me fishing again if you just tell me*****************how far from here were going that night pieter lays out his plans for us to head even deeper into the jungle to try and reach some creeks that he believes will be the best places for us to catch a wolffish but it will mean camping and being self-sufficient for several days in a place even more remote with all that has happened it is a brave plan and we decide to sleep on it but i discuss it with the crew and theres really only one decision im actually going even more remote if such a thing is possible i figure that if im gonna find a big wolffish im gonna need to go somewhere where even*****************tiriyo dont normally go the sheer size of the corentyne river is humbling in places it is over two miles wide a confusion of tangled islands channels rocky outcrops and narrow rapids we are using a local boatman called bona who knows the river well without him i would quickly become lost in this watery maze the jungle echoes with eerie calls and cries but it is too impenetrable to reveal the creatures making the noise animals calling three hours later and with nothing but endless rainforest on either bank we arrive at our new base camp its a collection of small tents on a sandbar on an island in the middle of nowhere from here i will carry*****************my campaign to catch a wolffish i waste no time getting ready and before the sun sets we head out to the nearest creek to get our bearings wolffish it seems head up creeks during the wet season dispersing into the flooded forest but as the water recedes they are forced back down towards the main river it is then that they are their easiest to find im here in what should be the lowest water levels of the year but straightaway it is apparent the conditions are not ideal very much mixed feelings on arriving at the camp the thing that struck me immediately was that the water level is probably about two foot up on what wed*****************for what wed expected and what is ideal for catching the wolffish basically what that means is that the creeks are gonna be that much fuller so the fish arent gonna be concentrated theyre gonna be spread up the creek they wont be as hungry they wont be as aggressive so catching them is likely to be harder than i expected wade i have now heard incredible stories of how fearless wolffish are i have caught the huge piranha that they compete with in these rivers i have traveled so far and risked so much that to fall at the last hurdle would be a disaster this creek is a really eerie place a pool enclosed by rainforest in*****************actually very frustrating every bait im throwing out is getting attacked but unfortunately its by piranhas ah piranha again im hoping that as the light fades they will become less active but at the moment ive got a dwindling supply of bait because the piranhas are just attacking it every time my best chance is to wait until night wade salamoni told me that once the sun sets the piranhas run and hide because thats when the wolffish come out to hunt it seems that piranhas know who the real river monster is fish on oh yeah i finally got a wolffish on my line but im not the only one with an eye on my catch theres a caiman right in front of me i do the only thing i can think of im gonna try and just pull this up on the side with the worst possible result*****************bleep bleep bleep i was trying to pull the fish up on the side because the caiman was after it and ive lost it ive lost it damn should have had that fish if that caiman hadnt been there id have probably had that fish what i was trying to do was just slide it out on the side here hook came out grunts damn i cant risk going back even though i know wolffish are there caiman are territorial and it was certainly not afraid of me it will be there again tomorrow without doubt and next time it might not just go for the fish a 7-foot caiman could easily attack and a severe injury out here*****************have serious ramifications but morning gives us another problem rain the storm makes me and the whole crew nervous we are nearing the end of the dry season when the rainy season starts two things will happen first the creeks will flood and the fish already hard to find will disappear into flooded forest making them impossible to catch second and possibly more important we could become stranded the airstrip is upstream and its our only way home if the water gets too high and fast we will not be able to get out its a sobering thought and it makes me look as much to the sky as i do to the water and i certainly dont want*****************test the theory that lightning never strikes the same place twice the new creek that im targeting is much narrower and even more surrounded with snags and tangles than the previous one oh its off groans nothing seems to be going my way all my previous luck seems to have run out just putting bait on here not getting any response to artificial so im putting a lump of piranha on theres been a couple of fish actually moving in here one right underneath this tangle of branches so its fishing right in the middle of snags in a place like this if it gets even a few feet its wrapped itself around a branch so i give it*****************enough line to take the bait properly and then its just try and haul it to the boat theres been nothing moving here now for quite a while so i think what ill do ill go further up the creek and maybe drop in here later nothing doing here at the moment wade the only option left is to enter this creek at night with half-hidden roots and fallen trees navigating this waterway is a disaster waiting to happen and it seems every creek has its caiman to make matter worse i hear a rumble of thunder thunder crashes my window of opportunity is about to slam shut this could be my last chance to catch a wolffish oh*****************wait wait wait wait oh off off off no that could have been a piranha that took it into a snag i think it could be time to call it a night these things are very active at the moment wade with the storm edging ever closer and hungry piranha seemingly beating any wolffish to my bait im considering calling it a night but then i make a discovery wait a minute ive got a scale here ive got a scale that looks like a small wolffish the storm is closing in but so are the wolffish i decide to fish on thunder rumbles here we go here we go finally a strong take its a wolffish the monster*****************spent the past three weeks trying to catch and its a big one over she comes ah fantastic here we go theres the result thats lovely so here we are this is the wolffish the stories ive heard about these absolutely fearless anything comes near them dogs people theyll go for it it looks quite gap-toothed but actually pull those lips back and you see there are very spiky fangs underneath there the other thing about it is the fishing is just unlike anything ive done before its real guerilla close quarters hand-to-hand combat almost wade my quest for the wolffish has pushed me to my limits damn it seems appropriate that ive had to push deeper and deeper*****************the greatest rainforest in the world to find the most savage and untamed river monster to date the piranha gets all the press but this guy delivers the goods its well-armed with a fearsome set of teeth but its also fiery and fearless attacking animals and people even out of the water and im convinced this is the fish that possibly pound for pound is the toughest most monstrous fish of south america there it is the wolffish,hoplias aimara also known as anjumara traira trahira manjuma anjoemara and giant wolf fish is a species of freshwater fish found in the rivers of south america in amazonia the native populations are concerned by high levels of

silent assassin,short-tailed river stingray,potamotrygon brachyura,wade my name is jeremy wade biologist and extreme fisherman ive hunted down freshwater monsters all over the world hey indistinct shouting investigated macabre human deaths and savage attacks aah it is not often that i come across a fish ive not heard of before especially when it could be among the largest freshwater fish i have ever tackled motor whirring i am heading to the remote northeast corner of argentina to catch a monster that somehow got under my radar there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is a creature responsible for horrific injuries it will dissolve the flesh reel whirring ohh even death recently i heard rumors of a giant freshwater fish that if true would be a brand-new species to me one that i never knew existed in a country that i know little about im in argentina im on my way to the parana river its the second-biggest river system in south america after the amazon i know other rivers in south america very well and the creatures that live in them but this river is very little known in the outside world and its also new territory for me and most important this river harbors a killer a little while ago i heard about a child who died as a result of encountering something in the water girl humming a 12-year-old girl was playing close to her village on one of the remote islands set in this huge river she had entered the water countless times before but this time it would be different this time there was something waiting in the shallows only yards from the bank the attack was brief but ferocious aah aah she stood no chance against such weaponry aah aah aah she died soon after in her mothers arms killed by a freshwater monster engine shuts off the evidence from the death points to one suspect shallow water piercing barb and speed of attack all suggest a stingray but this is freshwater and i wasnt aware that there were stingrays in this river the parana river rises in southern brazil and travels through paraguay into argentina before emptying into the atlantic miles from its source the outback town of bella vista lies on the banks of this great river miles from the sea before the arrival of the spanish this corner of argentina was the land of the guarani people it is now the home of gauchos farmers and fishermen it still has the air of a frontier town here this is where i am basing myself on my quest for a leviathan i meet up with some fishermen to find out more about the death of the girl and the creature that i am pitting myself against mm-hmm and i discover a lot more than i expected speaking spanish speaking spanish they tell me about a small boy who was playing in the river only a short distance from his mother when he was attacked speaking spanish boy aah there was a commotion in the water then silence and the boys lifeless body floated in the shallows right where hed been playing conversing in spanish what they are describing is a ray but not one ive ever come across they call it chucho de rio or river dog ive caught giant rays before in thailand a massive creature with a tail like a bullwhip but what theyre describing here sounds very different and unlike that estuarine monster the chucho de rio has made its home miles from the sea and what really makes this monster different is that it has killed but how what makes this animal uniquely dangerous i visit the regional hospital to meet dr gomez a surgeon who knows all about stingray wounds conversing in spanish its not a clean cut youve got these serrations on the spike so what happens it makes a mess when it goes in and then it also rips the flesh when it comes out the two children most likely died because the barb punctured an artery or vital organ and they quickly bled to death but that is not the only cause of death from this massive stingray dr gomez draws the barb with its backward-facing serrations and venom dr gomez speaking spanish so the mucus thats on the spine it doesnt just contain bacteria there is actually a venom there resulting in deep putrid wounds laced with toxins the entire outer skin produces a necrotic venom which becomes more concentrated around the tail and along the barb meaning it is literally cloaked in a venom that destroys tissue i head out knowing that im on the trail of a creature with such a fearsome reputation that the local fishermen refuse to fish for them jose my boatman is an accomplished fisherman he has the all-important local knowledge that i always depend on his help will be essential if i am to navigate this labyrinth and find the hidden monster this river is a very very big river i was really quite taken aback by the size of it but as always youve got features this is a little channel and what weve got weve got a real push of current out here but then that current sort of eddies around theres a nice slack on that side there and its exactly the kind of place where any kind of fish would hang out and then the predators are gonna hang out feeding on them rays are members of the shark family but have flattened bodies and winglike fins as yet ive not been able to find out any accurate data about the size of the chucho de rio but the fishermen here tell me they grow very big i want to know how big stingrays patrol the river bottom predating on small fish and invertebrate which they locate using sensors that detect the preys minute electrical field my gear is too heavy to cast so i have to adapt for bait im using armored catfish which i float out underneath a bottle and i release by pulling sharply on the line jose has a handline attached to the bottle which he retrieves after the bait has dropped perfecto chuckles ive not got very much lead on theres quite a surge of current here but the whole thing that i was trying to do was to use the current to take it down and then pull it off just in the slack beside the current and thats exactly whatll happen to a food item if youre having to use loads of lead to keep it down then its not the kind of place where food is gonna settle but ive got a nice sort of slack bow in the line which tells me that that bait is in a good place this is the same rod that i took to south africa where i caught two 500-pound bull sharks in thailand i felt the full force of the rays strength its spinning the boat its taking the boat down but also the disappointment of losing what to this day could be the biggest fish ive ever had on my line ohh i am not going to let the same thing happen again so armed with what i learned out there i prepare to catch myself a monster oh here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go thats somethings really after that there somethings really after it theres a disturbance at the surface and then nothing hmm i may or may not have a bait left jose thinks that could have been a small ray maybe having trouble getting the bait in its mouth here we go here we go here we go reel whirring thats actually fairly unusual when i attempted to set the hook there there was nothing there but i left the bait in position and literally within a minute or so something was back at it so it suggests theres lots of lots of fish down there so just check that ive uh got the bait ah there we go so the bait is actually gone something actually pulled it off whatever is down there seems to be onto me its gone very quiet im forced to try another location yeah well that bait lasted about a minute something like that it started off as a vicious tapping and then off it went one after another my baits are stolen yeah well thats not gonna catch anything though that isnt new eh something down there is outsmarting me removing the bait even before i can get it to the bottom you know always theres this conflict between do i just stick it out carrying on doing what im doing or do i change something and you have to sort of reach a happy medium with that you have to sort of give something a good go but be prepared to change if you know it looks like youre doing something wrong reel whirring grunts something on there i think oh its a piranha its a piranha wow right whats happened there is that the baits been chopped in half and then i foul-hooked a piranha in the back i think its fairly clear that this is whats been taking my bait and you know talk about caught red-handed theres the evidence chunky chunky piranha ive not actually caught this kind of piranha before they call it palometa here its very similar to the red-belly piranhas in the amazon its got that orangey throat area very very solid muscular head um its a very serious piranha that there are killers of all sizes patrolling this river motor whirring but it is said that the people who live along its banks fear stingrays more than any other mm its a great viewpoint here whenever possible i like to look down on a river you really can just see so much more and whats really apparent here is what looks like the opposite bank when youre down at water level actually thats just an island theres loads of islands here whats also interesting here i can see theres a couple of houses dotted around and i think its very important that i go and talk to those people these are the people who can tell me not just where to go and try to catch fish but they might have heard as well about these incidents that ive heard about these people live a nomadic existence during the wet season their ranches are submerged underwater they spend months cut off from the outside world at a ranch on an island i talk with a group of gauchos who explain the dangers of living in such isolation alongside one of the rivers most feared predators conversing in spanish yes you know there are stingrays here conversing in spanish i just asked do you know anybody whos ever been wounded by one yes yes you know not just people but also cows and horses too conversing in spanish he said they have known horses to die as a result of a blood vessel being punctured horse neighs conversing in spanish but also theyve had other horses die from infection speaking spanish he says its almost as if the horses are crying because the pain is so bad horse neighs the first place ive stopped yes there are rays here and not just people but also large animals have actually been killed by these rays im after a creature that can kill a horse yet is virtually unknown to the outside world rays have a finely tuned sensory system which they use to locate prey but these sensors could also detect my thick line and hook so by changing to finer gear i hope to fool the ray into taking my bait im gonna scale down and uh thats just a bit finer still very strong 175-pound breaking strength that this is the main line here its not gonna create a lot of drag when it moves through the water the currents not gonna pick it up im actually quite pleased with that setup i give it one more go in the hope that as evening falls the piranhas will stop feeding reel whirring grunts nothing nothing thats very odd imitates reel whirring stop ding dun dun dun speaking spanish piranhas are still active by the look of it cursed by piranhas it is vital to understand the behavior of the other fish in the river besides your quarry in order to avoid the other species like the omnipresent piranha to remove these sight hunters from the equation i begin fishing at night insects chirping i set my line now confident it is past piranha feeding time grunts nothing so much for that plan another one bites the dust but i feel as though the noose is tightening i am closing in so i further fine-tune my approach i discard the bottle and begin casting dropping the bait quickly to the river bottom reducing the amount of time its hanging around in midwater now will i finally be rid of the curse of the piranhas reel whirring there see that grunts it feels like a piranha but its too big for a piranha i think reel whirring wade ah look at that so much for piranhas not feeding at night sighs these parana river piranhas are among the largest and most ferocious i have ever come across and its so big i cant really get my hand around it ive encountered piranhas before i know that in the right conditions they are capable of attacking and devouring the largest prey in seconds i dont think i particularly want to fall in here piranhas big piranhas but also active at night it shows just how hungry everything is in here i fish for hours thats really kicking ah i think thats a is that a piranha only to pull in one piranha after another each as big as the last that could be time to call it call it a night if these guys are active but its hard to give up when i know the monster stingray must be down there wonder what this is ooh ooh look at that grunts so this is a sort of this is a predatory catfish this is a small one these things grow oops ohh they grow over pounds so you know or foot long but i mean blows the thing about this fish for me is you know its a catfish but its a very athletic streamlined catfish its a catfish that hunts actively this ones got quite spiky fins there so i ought to be careful ohh ow bleep thats just dug its spine right in the back of my hand that went right oh my god ive handled these fish actually like loads of times before this is the first time ive been stabbed by one of these it kicked and it just that was its pectoral spine going in the back of my hand although painful these catfish spines do not have a venom what this is making me think about is im gonna have to try and deal with a stingray at night and you know just a moments loss of concentration with a small catfish and thats the result in the amazon stingrays are known as wish you were dead fish because of the agonizing pain following a stab from the barb even though stingray meat is good to eat and a large ray could feed many people fishermen here refuse to hunt them the next morning i meet fellow fisherman donal pereira who hooked one accidentally a momentary lack of concentration and he felt the full force of the stingrays barb speaking spanish so he was actually fishing for one at the time so he wasnt walking in the water he actually had one on the line from the fishing from the bank and then when he pulled it in he lifted it up and suddenly it just whipped its tail around conversing in spanish this happened years ago and theres still a very obvious scar there and hes telling me and ive sort of i didnt believe it at first like i wanted to hear it again six or seven years to heal it was suppurating for that amount of time you know from just one moment of being stabbed six seven years of a nasty wound taking all that time to heal necrosis can lead to gangrene the death of one cell quickly cascades spreading to the surrounding cells killing everything around it following envenomation the victim suffers severe pain vomiting paralysis tremors even heart failure and if not treated death as i head back to my boat i come across a macabre sight my first encounter with the chucho de rio but this is not the way i was hoping to see it wood creaking conversing in spanish the lad in the boat just said what a monstrous animal it is very much like an alien it doesnt look like any normal fish the guts have been taken out no tail tails been hacked off on this and this is actually a fish that i didnt know existed until i came here ive known for ages that you get stingrays in freshwater but this particular species were talking about a very short time that ive known this existed and here is the evidence in the flesh i mean theres no doubt about it this is a very very creepy-looking fish youve got these fine denticles all over the body like miniature teeth some of them are more enlarged as we get to the tail look at that thats starting to get some really serious sharp lumpy denticles there you know thats quite apart from the spine youve got on the back which is just like this sort of dirty serrated blade so i mean this animal its not just the tail this is just like a very lethally armed animal this stingray is much bulkier than the one i caught in thailand which was flatter more slight thats a good 48-inch wingspan the power of this massive body is transmitted to the tail just measuring the size of the tail as well as the size of the animal inches across so thats quite a serious club-like weapon never mind the big spike in the end one tipped with tissue-destroying venom now to find out the true weight of the chucho de rio grunting its registering just over pounds there and of course its missing the tail and its missing all the guts and its been out in the sun dehydrating and bleeding so its something like when this was alive you know i think we can be fairly safe about that a genuine river monster but if the stories are true then there are even bigger fighters out there that is what im after to see for myself the weaponry and the behavior that makes this creature a killer this body of water is vast ive been here now for nearly two weeks and jose and i have scoured the area without any results so i cant restrict myself to fishing just at night i have to get a bait in the water as often as i can the rivers got a very different character to it today theres this wind blowing upstream and what that does its creating these standing waves here about foot high it actually turns into quite an intimidating place and there is so much competition for food especially from the ever-present piranhas feeding well i just cast the bait out and there was instantly something on the bait but it just felt like piranhas it was like imitates gobbling like that coming through whereas what i actually want is something that just goes chomp reel clicking grunts reel whirring feels like a piranha but the parana river is full of surprises ah its a different kind of catfish this looks like a new species for me although its very similar to one ive caught in the amazon yeah there we go thats a different fish and again its just another fish that is going to you know polish off my baits you know it really is a problem actually just having a bait down there thats gonna survive long enough for the stingray which is very much the top predator thatll come along and find it motor whirring big strikes often come when you least expect them so i have to stay prepared for when my rod bends double with the weight of a 250-pound monster reel whirring here we go thats a fish theres a fish on this is by far the biggest fish yet to take my bait its coming close here he is there it is there it is there it is thats a stingray at last my first glimpse of a live chucho de rio hes off the bottom but theres trees down here although this is only a juvenile it is still armed with a deadly barb and tissue-destroying venom thats a long way off yet but i dont want to bring this into the boat so i ask jose to head for the nearest beach speaking spanish i put on knife-proof kevlar gloves to protect me against the barb ill just pull it up as soon as its out of the water its tail is aiming for me i noticed that this ray is a heavier build than other rays ive caught and the tail much shorter more like a dagger than a whip im gonna see if i can get a look at that the rays tail is coated with toxic venom just gonna see if i can get any mucus off here general fish slime thats just sort of slime thats mucus but living in there youve got a cocktail of bacteria im actually thinking about what those cowboys were saying theyve had horses die from fatal bleeding but also from the infection when theyve stepped on a ray grunts thats actually one heavy beast and thats the im just feeling the weight of this animal now and this is a small one im just thinking a weapon like that with 500 maybe pounds behind it you know its like somebody coming at you with a medieval mace in a way its like a club with a nail in it anyway lets get it back easing it into slightly deeper water now just looking at the pattern of this and just you know it does just completely disappear into the background it really does bring home how dangerous potentially these things are when you just see how theyre just almost invisible in the water that was actually a small one what i want to see now is a big one of those but if i do get one i think im really gonna have my hands full birds squawking ive been trolling this river now for days straight and im beginning to think that the only giant ray im going to see is the one hanging on the riverbank so im fishing all the hours i can to maximize my chances reel whirring grunts look at that dorado jose and i fish all over the river this is a mandube catfish mystery bait remover thats another night with no stingrays theyre proving elusive ive caught everything except what i came for now i try something that i wouldnt normally do ive got a second rod out a lot of people in the town are giving me advice what i need to be doing and one of the things that keeps cropping up is you havent got enough lines in the water i dont totally hold with that i dont necessarily believe that two rods gives you double the chance but it all comes down to just one bait being in the right place even though ive given in to using two rods only one is really strong enough to land a monster if the lighter rod happens to hook a fish i could be outgunned reel clicks reel whirring grunts thats a good fish thats a good-sized fish this feels like a ray uh just my luck the fish took the bait on the lighter outfit which isnt really up to the job sighs this is bigger than the last one for sure in thailand a giant ray snapped a rod that wasnt right for the job something i really dont want to happen again on the limit of what this gear can hold really yeah thats moving its moving plus it looks like the river bottom is littered with dead trees one snag and this fish is gone im off a very snaggy island at the moment if we can just slowly slowly go down in the current then were clear of that and were were then adjacent to a beach and also the currents slack there we can just very slowly coax it into shallow slack water because the ray took the bait on the weaker rod i have limited pulling power so im in for the long haul its now been on well over an hour at last ive got past the piranhas catfish and dorado but the creature on the end of the line might be twice my size and it isnt going to give itself up easily hours and minutes now this is becoming a war of attrition which will crack first the ray the rod or me ooh yes yes after grueling days of fishing ive hooked what could be the biggest totally freshwater river monster ive ever had on my line it feels like it has come unstuck from the bottom a couple of times but most of the time its just a dead weight every now and again theres a slight movement it rises and then it sort of sticks down again rays stick themselves to the bottom prying them off is like pulling the plug out of the river this just feels like a dead weight a dead weight it could be in a tree it could be in a tree its using all its bulk and the flow of the river to defeat me what im gonna do is just take the boat upstream a little bit and im just gonna apply some pressure just from the other side cause if it is in a snag possibly if i can just get a different angle on it jose has to maneuver very precisely in the strong current thats the tail hitting the line tail hitting the line with a fish like this im not in control all i can do is react three hours this is my longest battle ever beating even the south african bull shark that took hours and minutes my back and arms are now burning groaning that is fish i think that is fish that is fish that is fish that is fish its back my maneuver worked so a bit of tactics there nothing was happening nothing nothing nothing and i think it might have just hooked the line round a branch so we just changed the angle of the pull slightly look at that there it goes there it goes thats good thats good i want to get it to the beach where i can handle it safely but that means coaxing it yards further downstream weve got literally just feet from the bank as the creature tires i have it exactly where i want it there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is finally after perhaps the most punishing battle i have ever had i land one of the biggest strongest and most alien freshwater fish ive ever seen the thing i really want to do with this one though is get a closeup of the tail i mean obviously not too close and to think this is a fish that until recently i didnt even know existed the chucho de rio is unlike any other ray ive come across okay nearly which would make it easily pounds but what really makes this species stand out is that it is a killer with a weapon as brutal as a medieval mace like a club fortified with rusty nails which it drives in with its massive bulk i might actually just kneel on top of the animal uh okay grunts thats what i wanted to look at the dead animal i saw had its tail chopped off this one has its sting intact its got two stings on there and also by the look of it you know this can come a long way on either side its also very flexible so i wouldnt want to get anywhere near this time to put this back in the water my arms are just aching so much ive been fishing solid for days if this feels anything like i do its very tired what im about to do know is actually very significant because this is a fish and i always like to return fish alive but this is a fish where you know the locals dont give it any quarter this stingray has evolved to survive in totally freshwater in fact it is now thought to be incapable of living in the sea just bent over it here im just not seeing the shape of the fish at all ive just got this huge broad back with this amazing pattern on it as fish go it has to be one of the strangest fish there is and in a river as well you know the size of this thing ive been fishing the worlds rivers now for four decades but landing a monster like this makes me wonder what else is out there still to discover,the short-tailed river stingray potamotrygon brachyura is a species of river stingray family potamotrygonidae native to the rio de la plata basin in south america it is sometimes known as the giant freshwater stingray but this name is typically used for urogymnus polylepis growing to a disc diameter of about m ft and a weight of kg lb with unconfirmed records of even larger specimens the short-tailed river stingray is the largest freshwater species in its family and one of the heaviest strict freshwater fish in south america only matched by the arapaima arapaima and piraiba catfish brachyplatystoma filamentosum the primary threat to the short-tailed river stingray is fishing for food and as a game fish if not released but it is also under pressure from habitat loss and occasionally caught for aquaria description the short-tailed river stingray is circular in shape and humped in the back the species can reach about m ft in disc diameter and kg lb in weight making it the largest freshwater species in the family potamotrygonidae they have a dark pattern on their backs probably used as camouflage the rays tail is very muscular and thick covered with short spines at the base and a venomous sting at the end distribution the short-tailed river stingray is found in the rio de la plata basin including the paraguay parana and uruguay rivers in the countries of argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay it may also range into bolivia in the pilcomayo river a tributary of the paraguay river but this remains unconfirmed in the north it ranges from the upper paraguay river basin including the pantanal and south to the lowermost freshwater sections of the rio de la plata unlike some other freshwater rays it has not been able to spread to the upper parana river basin after the itaipu dam flooded the guaira falls which represented a natural barrier to its range lifestyle female short-tailed river stingrays give birth to up to fully formed young stingrays per litter the pups start off eating plankton and then move on to consume small mollusks crustaceans the larvae of aquatic insects and fish references

jeremy wade biologist and extreme fisherman ive hunted down freshwater monsters all over the world hey indistinct shouting investigated macabre human deaths and savage attacks aah it is not often that i come across a fish ive not heard of before especially when it could be among the largest freshwater fish i have ever tackled motor whirring i am heading to the remote northeast corner of argentina to catch a monster that somehow got under my radar there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is a creature responsible for horrific injuries it will dissolve the flesh reel whirring ohh even death recently i heard rumors of a giant freshwater fish that if true would be a brand-new species to me one that i never knew existed in a country that i know little about im in*****************im on my way to the parana river its the second-biggest river system in south america after the amazon i know other rivers in south america very well and the creatures that live in them but this river is very little known in the outside world and its also new territory for me and most important this river harbors a killer a little while ago i heard about a child who died as a result of encountering something in the water girl humming a 12-year-old girl was playing close to her village on one of the remote islands set in this huge river she had entered the water countless times before but this time it would be different this*****************and travels through paraguay into argentina before emptying into the atlantic miles from its source the outback town of bella vista lies on the banks of this great river miles from the sea before the arrival of the spanish this corner of argentina was the land of the guarani people it is now the home of gauchos farmers and fishermen it still has the air of a frontier town here this is where i am basing myself on my quest for a leviathan i meet up with some fishermen to find out more about the death of the girl and the creature that i am pitting myself against mm-hmm and i discover a lot more than i expected speaking spanish speaking spanish they tell me about a small boy who was playing in the river only a short distance from his mother when he was attacked speaking spanish boy aah*****************gomez speaking spanish so the mucus thats on the spine it doesnt just contain bacteria there is actually a venom there resulting in deep putrid wounds laced with toxins the entire outer skin produces a necrotic venom which becomes more concentrated around the tail and along the barb meaning it is literally cloaked in a venom that destroys tissue i head out knowing that im on the trail of a creature with such a fearsome reputation that the local fishermen refuse to fish for them jose my boatman is an accomplished fisherman he has the all-important local knowledge that i always depend on his help will be essential if i am to navigate this labyrinth and find the hidden monster this river is a very very big river i was really quite taken aback by the size of it but as always youve got features this is a little channel*****************what weve got weve got a real push of current out here but then that current sort of eddies around theres a nice slack on that side there and its exactly the kind of place where any kind of fish would hang out and then the predators are gonna hang out feeding on them rays are members of the shark family but have flattened bodies and winglike fins as yet ive not been able to find out any accurate data about the size of the chucho de rio but the fishermen here tell me they grow very big i want to know how big stingrays patrol the river bottom predating on small fish and invertebrate which they locate using*****************that detect the preys minute electrical field my gear is too heavy to cast so i have to adapt for bait im using armored catfish which i float out underneath a bottle and i release by pulling sharply on the line jose has a handline attached to the bottle which he retrieves after the bait has dropped perfecto chuckles ive not got very much lead on theres quite a surge of current here but the whole thing that i was trying to do was to use the current to take it down and then pull it off just in the slack beside the current and thats exactly whatll happen to a food item if youre having to use loads*****************lead to keep it down then its not the kind of place where food is gonna settle but ive got a nice sort of slack bow in the line which tells me that that bait is in a good place this is the same rod that i took to south africa where i caught two 500-pound bull sharks in thailand i felt the full force of the rays strength its spinning the boat its taking the boat down but also the disappointment of losing what to this day could be the biggest fish ive ever had on my line ohh i am not going to let the same thing happen again so armed with what i learned out there*****************prepare to catch myself a monster oh here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go thats somethings really after that there somethings really after it theres a disturbance at the surface and then nothing hmm i may or may not have a bait left jose thinks that could have been a small ray maybe having trouble getting the bait in its mouth here we go here we go here we go reel whirring thats actually fairly unusual when i attempted to set the hook there there was nothing there but i left the bait in position and literally within a minute or so something was back at it so it suggests theres*****************of lots of fish down there so just check that ive uh got the bait ah there we go so the bait is actually gone something actually pulled it off whatever is down there seems to be onto me its gone very quiet im forced to try another location yeah well that bait lasted about a minute something like that it started off as a vicious tapping and then off it went one after another my baits are stolen yeah well thats not gonna catch anything though that isnt new eh something down there is outsmarting me removing the bait even before i can get it to the bottom you know always theres this conflict between do i just*****************whats really apparent here is what looks like the opposite bank when youre down at water level actually thats just an island theres loads of

kevlar gloves to protect me against the barb ill just pull it up as soon as its out of the water its tail is aiming for me i noticed that this ray is a heavier build than*****************rays ive caught and the tail much shorter more like a dagger than a whip im gonna see if i can get a look at that the rays tail is coated with toxic venom just gonna see if i can get any mucus off here general fish slime thats just sort of slime thats mucus but living in there youve got a cocktail of bacteria im actually thinking about what those cowboys were saying theyve had horses die from fatal bleeding but also from the infection when theyve stepped on a ray grunts thats actually one heavy beast and thats the im just feeling the weight of this animal now and this is a small one im just thinking*****************a small one what i want to see now is a big one of those but if i do get one i think im really gonna have my hands full birds squawking ive been trolling this river now for days straight and im beginning to think that the only giant ray im going to see is the one hanging on the riverbank so im fishing all the hours i can to maximize my chances reel whirring grunts look at that dorado jose and i fish all over the river this is a mandube catfish mystery bait remover thats another night with no stingrays theyre proving elusive ive caught everything except what i came for now i try something that i wouldnt normally do ive got a second rod out a lot of people in the town are giving me advice what i need to be doing and one of the*****************that keeps cropping up is you havent got enough lines in the water i dont totally hold with that i dont necessarily believe that two rods gives you double the chance but it all comes down to just one bait being in the right place even though ive given in to using two rods only one is really strong enough to land a monster if the lighter rod happens to hook a fish i could be outgunned reel clicks reel whirring grunts thats a good fish thats a good-sized fish this feels like a ray uh just my luck the fish took the bait on the lighter outfit which isnt really up to the job sighs this is bigger*****************the last one for sure in thailand a giant ray snapped a rod that wasnt right for the job something i really dont want to happen again on the limit of what this gear can hold really yeah thats moving its moving plus it looks like the river bottom is littered with dead trees one snag and this fish is gone im off a very snaggy island at the moment if we can just slowly slowly go down in the current then were clear of that and were were then adjacent to a beach and also the currents slack there we can just very slowly coax it into shallow slack water because the ray took the bait on the*****************rod i have limited pulling power so im in for the long haul its now been on well over an hour at last ive got past the piranhas catfish and dorado but the creature on the end of the line might be twice my size and it isnt going to give itself up easily hours and minutes now this is becoming a war of attrition which will crack first the ray the rod or me ooh yes yes after grueling days of fishing ive hooked what could be the biggest totally freshwater river monster ive ever had on my line it feels like it has come unstuck from the bottom a couple of times but most of the time*****************and im just gonna apply some pressure just from the other side cause if it is in a snag possibly if i can just get a different angle on it jose has to maneuver very precisely in the strong current thats the tail hitting the line tail hitting the line with a fish like this im not in control all i can do is react three hours this is my longest battle ever beating even the south african bull shark that took hours and minutes my back and arms are now burning groaning that is fish i think that is fish that is fish that is fish that is fish its back my maneuver worked so a bit of tactics there nothing was happening nothing nothing nothing and i think it might have just hooked the line round a branch so we just changed the angle of the pull slightly*****************at that there it goes there it goes thats good thats good i want to get it to the beach where i can handle it safely but that means coaxing it yards further downstream weve got literally just feet from the bank as the creature tires i have it exactly where i want it there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is finally after perhaps the most punishing battle i have ever had i land one of the biggest strongest and most alien freshwater fish ive ever seen the thing i really want to do with this one though is get a closeup of the tail i mean obviously*****************too close and to think this is a fish that until recently i didnt even know existed the chucho de rio is unlike any other ray ive come across okay nearly which would make it easily pounds but what really makes this species stand out is that it is a killer with a weapon as brutal as a medieval mace like a club fortified with rusty nails which it drives in with its massive bulk i might actually just kneel on top of the animal uh okay grunts thats what i wanted to look at the dead animal i saw had its tail chopped off this one has its sting intact its got two stings on there and also*****************the look of it you know this can come a long way on either side its also very flexible so i wouldnt want to get anywhere near this time to put this back in the water my arms are just aching so much ive been fishing solid for days if this feels anything like i do its very tired what im about to do know is actually very significant because this is a fish and i always like to return fish alive but this is a fish where you know the locals dont give it any quarter this stingray has evolved to survive in totally freshwater in fact it is now thought to be incapable of living in the*****************just bent over it here im just not seeing the shape of the fish at all ive just got this huge broad back with this amazing pattern on it as fish go it has to be one of the strangest fish there is and in a river as well you know the size of this thing ive been fishing the worlds rivers now for four decades but landing a monster like this makes me wonder what else is out there still to discover,the short-tailed river stingray potamotrygon brachyura is a species of river stingray family potamotrygonidae native to the rio de la plata basin in south america it is sometimes known as the giant freshwater stingray but this name is typically used for urogymnus polylepis growing to a disc diameter of about m ft and a weight of kg lb with unconfirmed records of even

the mutilator,red-bellied pacu,piaractus brachypomus,wade papua new guinea a land renowned for cannibalism macabre rituals headhunters and bitter tribal conflict but now something new is ripping through the heart of this island aah a creature that is tearing chunks from unsuspecting fishermen devouring certain body parts my name is jeremy wade biologist and extreme fisherman ive spent my life searching for freshwater monsters wade those teeth im heading to papua new guinea to find out what has acquired the taste for one particular part of the human body wade details about the attacks are unclear all i have to go on are a few sketchy reports from newspapers and internet the incidents first surfaced in the australian press which reported two separate but very similar fatal attacks in the sepik river in the remote northern region of papua new guinea patrick mo had just returned from a long day on the water he was bathing in the river margins right in front of his house when it struck he was hit by a powerful lone hunter a fast swimmer with jaws like a vice that ripped and tore his flesh screaming mo had certain body parts bitten off as a result of which he bled to death wade a second attack was eerily similar frances samben went to the river to wash dishes and cool off something he had done countless times before but this time it was to be very different this time hes not be going home aaah ive tracked freshwater killers all over the world but this is my first visit to papua new guinea which lies north of australia where the coral sea meets the south pacific it is one of the most dramatic and untouched islands anywhere on earth despite more than years of human habitation this landscape has changed little since prehistoric times much remains unexplored new species are regularly discovered so is the river killer a new arrival or has it been hiding away for centuries it is only now that i begin to realize the sheer size of this island and the remoteness of the area where im heading theres just an awful lot of forest out there im used to flying over forest in the amazon but this is very different while the amazon tends to be very flat most of it here were talking serious mountains and just completely cloaked in greenery the other thing is in the amazon if you look carefully you did see buildings down there you can see tin roofs occasionally glinting back at you and clearings in the trees but here just none of that at all it appears to be completely uninhabited down there wade these steep-sided mountains and impenetrable forests led to isolation and diversity among its plants and animals and suspicion and bitter tribal conflict between its people tribal fighting still exists in the less-accessible mountain regions but right now it is the water level that concerns me were now approaching the floodplain of the sepik river and theres a lot of water there this is supposed to be now into the dry season but im still seeing lots of water not just confined in the banks of the river but spreading throughout the landscape and the fish and everything else in the water are gonna be very spread out and its gonna make my job pretty difficult wade rising in the central mountains the sepik river snakes for over miles through impenetrable forest this is one of the last great unexplored rivers it is to papua new guinea what the congo is to africa and the amazon is to south america after four flights hours and miles i arrive in ambunti in the remote northwest corner of the country ive never been here before so im not too sure what im getting into theres no roads here so i think the stuffs coming out of the plane now and then its on to the water my base for the next two weeks is a village deep in the heart of the forest these tribes are cut off from the outside world the only way in or out is along this river little has changed here for centuries their culture is rich in superstition myths and mystery and they are notoriously wary of outsiders im met by one of the elders i sent word of my intended visit many months ago turning up unannounced is not taken kindly i do my best to smile and look friendly but im not getting much reaction so this is spirit house yes spirit house wade this was once the site of human sacrifice and even cannibalism now it is the place of worship and ceremony and where outsiders are called when they visit but im not too sure how welcome i am ive um been hearing stories about something in the water attacking people is this something that you know anything about yes so what is happening speaking pidgin there are over languages in papua new guinea but the trade language common to all is pidgin they also understand a little english the thing about pidgin is that there are english words that are recognizable and in the middle of that was a phrase ball cutter theres something in the water called a ball cutter and this does agree very much with the stories that ive heard people have been coming out of the water with injured genitals its interesting the first place that ive asked yes yes we know about this there is very something dangerous in the water so these injuries people being attacked is this something that has happened here speaking pidgin so it sounds like this is something they heard about here but nobody here has actually been attacked or at least not yet anyway and theyre saying the stories coupled with the name of this animal the ball cutter you know it is something that they are afraid of theyre very worried about particularly mothers are very concerned that their children are very careful in the water wade for villagers living here avoiding the river is virtually impossible their lives revolve around it now somewhere down there is a creature with teeth sharp enough to emasculate a man causing him to bleed to death in minutes ive investigated similar incidents before drag unwinds fish on look at that wade in central africa i caught a goliath tigerfish a species that has attacked and killed people in the congo river what weve got to worry about now is he biting his way out but that is mile away and goliaths are not found around here the village elders told me that none of the native fish species would be capable of inflicting such horrific injuries but something out there is responsible for these fierce attacks and i have no idea what it could be ive not been here before so i dont know what fish im likely to catch but what ill probably do ill probably start off light light line a little hook and a small bit of bait and try and catch some small fish that will start to give me a picture of whats down there and then what ill do i will try and move on to fish further up the food chain that are feeding on those little fish and catch the predators ive got a selection of artificial lures which resemble small fish but i might also just put a bit of dead fish on my line ive got some bigger hooks for that and because predators are very likely to have teeth ive got some wire along as well so basically ive just got a bag of bits and ill sort of make it up as i go along but starting with the small ones and gradually working my way up the food chain ive not been able to find out exactly where the attacks took place but i do know that they occurred close to a village so that is where i begin a bit of coconut as bait the villagers have told me that the fish around here find coconut irresistible im fishing right in front of the houses two reasons really fish often come very close to where people are because thats where people wash their dishes all that kind of thing also shallow water fish contrary to popular belief tend to be found very often in the shallows rather than in the deep theres more light there therefore more vegetation therefore theres more food and in no time at all i get a bite oh thats taking line off the clutch strong strong fish oh oh aaah lets have a look somethings actually that didnt break the line i wasnt putting that much pressure on that now that has actually cut it something down there has cut the line um thats interesting i was fishing very very close to the side and theres something down there with teeth whats interesting though it actually took a bit of coconut so youve got a vegetarian with teeth word has reached me of an incident in a nearby village ramson tero was attacked while paddling his canoe but his attacker wasnt a fish it was a 20-foot crocodile what happened was that ramson was collecting palm fronds for roofing his house and the first thing he knows is that a crocodile has actually come from underneath speaking pidgin he didnt see the body of the croc at all but it came along and just crunched one end of the boat gasping the size of the crocodiles jaws were more or less the length of his arm and he said he could have put his arm right down its throat that was the size of it at that point hes thinking well how do i get out of this ramson sat it out in the tree until the crock eventually lost interest and he was able to get away on his broken canoe speaking pidgin he was lucky over the years dozens of people have been killed by crocodiles in the sepik river this skin came from a 20-foot monster said to have learned to flip over canoes sepik river crocodiles certainly have a history of killing but are they the ball cutter im looking for the elders told me they doubt the native fish species here are capable of inflicting these injuries but something did bite through my line so i have to keep an open mind i head out with alphonse mavasanye a fisherman and crocodile specialist to see if somehow a crocodile could be responsible for these unusual mutilations he has brought me to the same area where ramson was attacked alphonse is actually going to try and call this crocodile to us the splashing mimics the sound of a large crocodile moving quickly through the water squeaking the call that of a young one both sounds should attract crocodiles to us ramson described the croc that attacked him as being over feet long wade but they kill by ripping and spinning tearing at flesh and devouring huge chunks at a time growling so it is unlikely that a large croc would only attack the genitals but could it be a smaller one or is something else lurking down there yeah yeah yeah yeah see the eyes just on the edge of this bit of vegetation here about yards in front of the boat now dense floating islands of vegetation perfect crocodile habitat its right in the vegetation they can stay submerged for over an hour you dont know theyre there until they attack each time we spot one it spooks and disappears they seem very wary but eventually alphonse grabs a baby one squeaking so this ones a salty one year so this could belong to the big one yeah this could be one of the children one of the children for the big one so the squeaking noise what is the squeaking noise - is it really - yes so you think it may be a good idea to put it back now - yeah yeah we can put it back i cant be certain that crocs are not responsible for the attacks but alphonse tells me that theyre rarely seen near villages now and both the genital attacks occurred close to the victims houses i think something else in this water has a taste for human flesh we saw one crocodile tonight i suppose an animal about or foot something like that judging by the amount of light coming back from the eyes but other than that its just been small ones and i suppose in one sense a bit of a relief not to come across the big one but in another sense im quite disappointed and also surprised that we havent seen more crocodiles tonight alphonse tells me that in recent years crocodile numbers are down and it is only in the past few years that the attacks on people have occurred could it be that whatever is attacking the fisherman is also attacking the crocodiles the next morning i set off again on the edge of the village im on the sepik river in a remote part of papua new guinea miles from home on the trail of a creature that is attacking unsuspecting fisherman blimey strong strong fish i can hardly believe my eyes when i see what is on the end of my line looks like a piranha it has got teeth but theyre not piranha teeth unless im very much mistaken that looks like a fish that i know from the amazon called a pacu the thing that gives it away is looking at the teeth theyre not cutting teeth they are grinding teeth i actually had my line cut a few days ago by a mystery fish here in the lakeside im actually seeing this now i think this is what it could be although theyre grinding teeth they have got quite sharp ridges on it and i think this is what it could have been wade unlike a piranha these teeth are not designed for slicing through flesh they are primarily vegetarian they feed on things like nuts that fall in the water so very interesting catch but i dont think this is actually the fish that im after phew whats it doing here the pacu is typically found on the other side of the world in south america and doesnt belong in the sepik puzzled i meet up with alphonse again i just wondered if you can tell me what this fish is doing here you said produced it was put here so its a new fish to give people something else to eat yeah yeah wade ive investigated introduced species before and know the devastating impact they can have on a river absolutely stiff with fish in the us silver carp escaped from a fish farm their numbers exploded and they now dominate entire stretches of the illinois river i feel the boat being buffeted as theyre banging into it the wels catfish was moved from the cold rivers of northern europe to the warm rich waters of spain where they grew into monsters with no natural predators and ample food both species have run amok upsetting the natural balance so could something like this now be happening in the sepik river word of my quest is spreading through the nearby villages ive been told of a fisherman named nick sarkat who was savaged by something in the river which wasnt a crocodile wade and then what you saw the size of the bite that was also similar to human teeth wasnt it - yes - so it looks like a person has bitten your foot - yes what are you thinking is down in the water whatever is down there is not only fast and ferocious its also powerful wade the village elders told me that there were only a handful of fish species out there none of them capable of carrying out such an attack i head out further from the village along smaller tributaries there has been so little exploration out here that new species are regularly discovered could it be that something unknown to science is responsible for these attacks theres something in the water here thats actually attacking people what im doing now im fishing to see if theres anything predatory down there im putting a lure on and what that will do that will flash and wobble vibrate and thats the kind of movement that could get a reflex grab so something with teeth is likely to go after this i change locations and try different lures but the result is always the same im just not getting any interest at all if this was an amazon lake a lake where you didnt have lots of commercial fishing then id expect maybe four or five different species certainly some hits but just nothing at all so it just points to the fact that theres not a great deal in the way of predatory fish in these waters having drawn a blank in the flooded forest as evening closes in i head back towards the village each of the attacks occurred close to where people live and the creature has clearly acquired the taste for flesh so what i need is a bait that tastes just like human and considering their cannibalistic past there are many people here who know just the thing wade in the days when the tribespeople here were cannibalistic they called human flesh long pig because the meat tasted so much like pork so that is what i will use its obviously something that a predator would be interested in but also with moving water here what that will do that will send a nice oily trail downcurrent so not just anything here but if theres anything downstream they might sniff that and move up and investigate there he is this looks like a pacu this is interesting because this was on a piece of meat so this supposedly vegetarian fish has just broken that habit this pacu the piranhas vegetarian relative seems to like the taste of flesh there we go so much for the vegetarian pacu if the pacu are eating pork then they could just as easily go for human flesh aaah so are they now taking on the behavior of their deadly relative the piranha im thinking that maybe i might have dismissed the pacu as the possible perpetrator of these attacks too soon in its normal habitat the amazon it is a vegetarian but it certainly has the weaponry to inflict serious damage on flesh all it would need would be a motive now if it turns out that there is not enough of its normal kind of food here then its gonna do what any animal would do in that situation which is to eat anything it can find in order to survive where piranhas are concerned small means deadly but pacu can grow much bigger here in papua new guinea theres virtually no commercial fishing and theres very little under the water in the way of predators so its quite possible that after only years youd find a bigger pacu living here than anything youd find in the amazon wade so is this yet another example of an introduction gone wrong especially as the attacks only started after the pacus arrival in the sepik river in their native south america there are or more fish species that share the common name pacu the one that has been introduced into papua new guinea is among the largest when young this pacu mimics the red-bellied piranha but as they grow they lose their red coloration and transform into formidable beasts pacu are armed with jaws powerful enough to crush the hard nuts that fall from trees these jaws are more than capable of ripping through soft human tissue if it were to resort to piranha-type behavior this river system would be forever transformed a vegetarian turned carnivore may be scientifically shocking but out here transformation is a way of life singing in native language tribespeople turn themselves into mythical beasts and carry out hypnotic dances to ward off evil or appease the river spirits when they are in trouble boys all along the sepik river are transformed into men through bloodletting by having the skin on their chests and backs cut leaving scars said to be the teeth marks of crocodiles and now if my hunch is correct the pacu is also undergoing a transformation from harmless vegetarian to flesh-eating river monster now my focus is catching a pacu capable of killing a man at the village i meet up with alphonse he tells me that since their introduction the pacu have been devastating the river system wade so youre saying that before the pacu was here this whole area even in the high water like now was covered with floating weed floating grass - yeah - and thats now gone do the crocodiles have a problem with the pacu these floating islands are the remnants of what once covered the entire lake the pacu are quite literally eating the native species of the sepik river out of house and home but it is not only the grass that they are eating - really - yeah - youve seen that - yeah all the fish from this lake the tale of destruction gets worse and worse i know the pacu eat the small fish the pacu are eating fish they are attacking snakes as they swim across the surface snakes is what the bird even water birds arent safe small ducks have been eaten as they paddle around - duck - duck the question is does everything include a particular part of the male anatomy aaah to find out exactly what big pacu are capable of i need to catch one so now im changing tack and heading deeper into the flooded forest sepik river people are extremely superstitious and believe that hostile spirits reside in the middle of these forests for them this is a menacing place what were doing is were paddling very very quietly through this area of flooded trees here and theres some signs of fish ive actually seen some fish chewing the ends of the weeds and some fish actually swirling underneath these nut trees so its just moving slowly and just casting close under the trees there are signs of pacu everywhere the sound of fruit hitting the water alerts them and they race in to eat it wade another catch but the red coloration tells me that again its a juvenile maybe i have to go further in although i find myself drawn in to local superstition im more concerned about what is lurking among the root tangles the heat in here is overwhelming and the trees cut out any breeze so the humidity is oppressive this is very different from fishing by the village there it doesnt matter you make a noise theyre used to the noise here the only noise they are listening for is the sound of falling nuts anything else other than that is going to scare them away personally i really enjoy this sort of close-quarters fishing where youre relying on stealth to get close to the fish youre not sort of making a lot of noise and just casting a long way and the only way you can get your bait into these areas is by getting in close another catch but this time the pull on the line suggests a larger pacu not wanting to put my hands anywhere near those jaws i use a long-handled grip to lift it out theyre getting bigger getting bigger the fishs muscular body makes it capable of bursts of speed it can attack and make a quick get away without being seen thats not the size that i want to catch i want to catch two maybe three times the length of that but thats good to see anyway as evening rolls in i head back to the village word has spread of my investigation and a fisherman has come to see me his name frances samben is familiar speaking pidgin as he talks i realize that this is the man the newspapers claim was killed by the ball cutter aaah the stories that i heard he didnt survive the encounter but im very pleased to say that in reality although this was a pretty terrifying experience by all accounts he did actually live to tell the tale wade although the rumors of sambens death were exaggerated the attack did leave him hospitalized and in agony the fish was large and incredibly powerful the bite was not a clean cut like a piranhas but tore and ripped his flesh aaah and he struggled to fight it off this echoes the story told to me by nick sarkat this giant relative of the piranha is as i thought growing to quite a size and with teeth to match i begin fishing again now fully aware of the strength of this creature but the difficulty will not be bringing it in or even landing it what worries me most is getting close to those jaws yeah yeah big one big one big one there it is look at that its really big its really big this could be the one ive been looking for i know theres snags on the bottom im trying to keep it away from that yeah just see it this black water you can just see it down there yeah yeah yeah oh yes just keep it away from stuff on the bottom but theres also peoples houses in the water keep it away from that for the moment its in open water thats good ill get it well and truly tired out before i try and do anything with this one then i need to examine it without losing a chunk of my hand i dont want to rush it grunts oh that actually just take a look at that as i lifted it out that straightened the hook as i lifted it out ooh this is interesting because ive just been seeing small ones of these that is thats a different animal from what i have been catching this is more of a size whew so the coloration on this is actually quite different from the small ones the small ones have a very dramatic red belly which on this have sort of faded away to this rather light orange but the biggest difference is aah gosh very muscular fish he just gave a bit of a kick there this is all muscle here so its a very strong fish very powerful but im just ooh im just trying to look at the business end here just look at that on the small one they were quite delicate teeth on here i mean those are real crushers what this fish normally feeds on in the amazon is seeds and nuts they often have tough cases to be opened so these teeth basically theyre nutcrackers this thing really does look like a giant piranha but the teeth on this not designed for cutting but for crushing and tearing seeing those teeth reminds me of all of the stories ive been told about the attacks on people aah those teeth really do look uncannily like human teeth and to be bitten by those i think that would be a very creepy experience it would be just like being bitten by a person they say when a piranha bites you when it actually bites you dont know its happening because its such a clean cut but this would be a very jagged messy tear and i think youd certainly know about this when this bit you and if these fish hear something splashing in the water they dont go heading in the opposite direction like other fish they come heading for that sound with those teeth bared im left in no doubt that the pacu is the ball cutter a vegetarian turned man-eater an outsize piranha with a taste for human flesh an alien invader running amok dominating entire stretches of the sepik river the river people now accept that the ball cutter is something they have to live with its just a graphic example of the unintended side effects that you can get when you start meddling with nature this nightmare may seem easy to dismiss as someone elses problem far from our own backyard but perhaps not pacu have now turned up in different states in the us so far numbers have not exploded nor has anyone been attacked but just as in the sepik things can change very quickly and once the genie is out of the bottle you can never put it back,piaractus brachypomus also known as the red-bellied pacu or pirapitinga is a large species of pacu a close relative of piranhas and silver dollars in the serrasalmid family it is native to the amazon basin in tropical south america but it formerly included populations in the orinoco which was described in as a separate species p orinoquensis additionally p brachypomus is widely farmed and has been introduced to other regions in south florida they are invasive in rivers canals or lakes as with a number of other closely related species p brachypomus is often referred to as the red-bellied pacu in reference to the appearance of the juveniles this has resulted in a great deal of confusion about the nature and needs of all the species involved with the reputation and requirements of one frequently being wrongly attributed to the others ecology in general its behavior resembles that of the closely related tambaqui colossoma macropomum it is migratory but the pattern is poorly understood spawning occurs at the beginning of the flood season between november and february larvae of the red-bellied pacu are found in whitewater rivers but adults mainly live in flooded forests and floodplains of various river types including those of both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor unlike the tambaqui the red-bellied pacu also occurs in the headwaters of nutrient-poor rivers not just in the lower sections it mainly feeds on fruits seeds and nuts but it is opportunistic and will also take zooplankton insects crustaceans and small fish especially in the dry season in general more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the red-bellied pacu than the tambaqui meaning that the former is overall a more efficient seed disperser appearance piaractus brachypomus can reach up to cm ft in length and kg lb in weight juveniles have a distinct red chest and stomach and are easily confused with the carnivorous red-bellied piranha pygocentrus nattereri but the two can be separated by their teeth which are molar-like in piaractus brachypomus this similarity is believed to be batesian mimicry by p brachypomus in an attempt of avoiding predation by other species adults lack the bright red chest and belly and resemble the tambaqui colossoma macropomum but can be separated by several meristic and morphological features the red-bellied pacu has a smaller adipose fin that lacks rays as well as differences in teeth and operculum the red-bellied pacu also has a more rounded head profile less elongated and pointed the other member of its genus p mesopotamicus can be distinguished by its smaller scale-size and the higher number of lateral scales more than connection to humans the red-bellied pacu supports major fisheries and based on a review by ibama it was the 12th most caught fish by weight in the brazilian amazon in just after the tambaqui the red-bellied pacu is often kept in aquaculture hybrids between this species and the tambaqui have been produced in aquaculture it can also hybridize with p orinoquensis but the offspring appears to be

papua new guinea a land renowned for cannibalism macabre rituals headhunters and bitter tribal conflict but now something new is ripping through the heart of this island aah a creature that is tearing chunks from unsuspecting fishermen devouring certain body parts my name is jeremy wade biologist and extreme fisherman ive spent my life searching for freshwater monsters wade those teeth im heading to papua new guinea to find out what has acquired the taste for one particular part of the human body wade details about the attacks are unclear all i have to go on are a few sketchy reports from newspapers and internet the incidents first surfaced in the australian press which reported two separate but very similar fatal attacks in the sepik river in the remote northern region of papua new guinea patrick mo had just returned from a long day on the water he was*****************in the river margins right in front of his house when it struck he was hit by a powerful lone hunter a fast swimmer with jaws like a vice that ripped and tore his flesh screaming mo had certain body parts bitten off as a result of which he bled to death wade a second attack was eerily similar frances samben went to the river to wash dishes and cool off something he had done countless times before but this time it was to be very different this time hes not be going home aaah ive tracked freshwater killers all over the world but this is my first visit to papua new guinea which lies north of australia where*****************regions but right now it is the water level that concerns me were now approaching the floodplain of the sepik river and theres a lot of water there this is supposed to be now into the dry season but im still seeing lots of water not just confined in the banks of the river but spreading throughout the landscape and the fish and everything else in the water are gonna be very spread out and its gonna make my job pretty difficult wade rising in the central mountains the sepik river snakes for over miles through impenetrable forest this is one of the last great unexplored rivers it is to papua new guinea what the congo is to africa and the amazon is to south america after four flights hours and miles i arrive in ambunti in the remote northwest corner of the country ive never been here before so*****************has actually been attacked or at least not yet anyway and theyre saying the stories coupled with the name of this animal the ball cutter you know it is something that they are afraid of theyre very worried about particularly mothers are very concerned that their children are very careful in the water wade for villagers living here avoiding the river is virtually impossible their lives revolve around it now somewhere down there is a creature with teeth sharp enough to emasculate a man causing him to bleed to death in minutes ive investigated similar incidents before drag unwinds fish on look at that wade in central africa i caught a goliath tigerfish a species that has attacked and killed people in the congo river what weve got to worry about now is he biting his way out but that is mile away and goliaths are not found around here*****************village elders told me that none of the native fish species would be capable of inflicting such horrific injuries but something out there is responsible for these fierce attacks and i have no idea what it could be ive not been here before so i dont know what fish im likely to catch but what ill probably do ill probably start off light light line a little hook and a small bit of bait and try and catch some small fish that will start to give me a picture of whats down there and then what ill do i will try and move on to fish further up the food chain that are feeding on those little fish and*****************the predators ive got a selection of artificial lures which resemble small fish but i might also just put a bit of dead fish on my line ive got some bigger hooks for that and because predators are very likely to have teeth ive got some wire along as well so basically ive just got a bag of bits and ill sort of make it up as i go along but starting with the small ones and gradually working my way up the food chain ive not been able to find out exactly where the attacks took place but i do know that they occurred close to a village so that is where i begin a bit of coconut*****************bait the villagers have told me that the fish around here find coconut irresistible im fishing right in front of the houses two reasons really fish often come very close to where people are because thats where people wash their dishes all that kind of thing also shallow water fish contrary to popular belief tend to be found very often in the shallows rather than in the deep theres more light there therefore more vegetation therefore theres more food and in no time at all i get a bite oh thats taking line off the clutch strong strong fish oh oh aaah lets have a look somethings actually that didnt break the line i wasnt putting that much pressure*****************that now that has actually cut it something down there has cut the line um thats interesting i was fishing very very close to the side and theres something down there with teeth whats interesting though it actually took a bit of coconut so youve got a vegetarian with teeth word has reached me of an incident in a nearby village ramson tero was attacked while paddling his canoe but his attacker wasnt a fish it was a 20-foot crocodile what happened was that ramson was collecting palm fronds for roofing his house and the first thing he knows is that a crocodile has actually come from underneath speaking pidgin he didnt see the body of the croc at*****************but it came along and just crunched one end of the boat gasping the size of the crocodiles jaws were more or less the length of his arm and he said he could have put his arm right down its throat that was the size of it at that point hes thinking well how do i get out of this ramson sat it out in the tree until the crock eventually lost interest and he was able to get away on his broken canoe speaking pidgin he was lucky over the years dozens of people have been killed by crocodiles in the sepik river this skin came from a 20-foot monster said to have learned to flip over canoes*****************river crocodiles certainly have a history of killing but are they the ball cutter im looking for the elders told me they doubt the native fish species here are capable of inflicting these injuries but something did bite through my line so i have to keep an open mind i head out with alphonse mavasanye a fisherman and crocodile specialist to see if somehow a crocodile could be responsible for these unusual mutilations he has brought me to the same area where ramson was attacked alphonse is actually going to try and call this crocodile to us the splashing mimics the sound of a large crocodile moving quickly through the water squeaking the call that of a young one*****************recent years crocodile numbers are down and it is only in the past few years that the attacks on people have occurred could it be that whatever is attacking the fisherman is also attacking the crocodiles the next morning i set off again on the edge of the village im on the sepik river in a remote part of papua new guinea miles from home on the trail of a creature that is attacking unsuspecting fisherman blimey strong strong fish i can hardly believe my eyes when i see what is on the end of my line looks like a piranha it has got teeth but theyre not piranha teeth unless im very much mistaken that looks like a fish that i know from the amazon called a pacu the thing that gives it away is looking at the teeth theyre not cutting teeth they are grinding teeth i actually*****************my line cut a few days ago by a mystery fish here in the lakeside im actually seeing this now i think this is what it could be although theyre grinding teeth they have got quite sharp ridges on it and i think this is what it could have been wade unlike a piranha these teeth are not designed for slicing through flesh they are primarily vegetarian they feed on things like nuts that fall in the water so very interesting catch but i dont think this is actually the fish that im after phew whats it doing here the pacu is typically found on the other side of the world in south america and doesnt belong in the*****************puzzled i meet up with alphonse again i just wondered if you can tell me what this fish is doing here you said produced it was put here so its a new fish to give people something else to eat yeah yeah wade ive investigated introduced species before and know the devastating impact they can have on a river absolutely stiff with fish in the us silver carp escaped from a fish farm their numbers exploded and they now dominate entire stretches of the illinois river i feel the boat being buffeted as theyre banging into it the wels catfish was moved from the cold rivers of northern europe to the warm rich waters of spain where they grew*****************monsters with no natural predators and ample food both species have run amok upsetting the natural balance so could something like this now be happening in the sepik river word of my quest is spreading through the nearby villages ive been told of a fisherman named nick sarkat who was savaged by something in the river which wasnt a crocodile wade and then what you saw the size of the bite that was also similar to human teeth wasnt it - yes - so it looks like a person has bitten your foot - yes what are you thinking is down in the water whatever is down there is not only fast and ferocious its also powerful wade the*****************elders told me that there were only a handful of fish species out there none of them capable of carrying out such an attack i head out further from the village along smaller tributaries there has been so little exploration out here that new species are regularly discovered could it be that something unknown to science is responsible for these attacks theres something in the water here thats actually attacking people what im doing now im fishing to see if theres anything predatory down there im putting a lure on and what that will do that will flash and wobble vibrate and thats the kind of movement that could get a reflex grab so something with teeth is likely*****************go after this i change locations and try different lures but the result is always the same im just not getting any interest at all if this was an amazon lake a lake where you didnt have lots of commercial fishing then id expect maybe four or five different species certainly some hits but just nothing at all so it just points to the fact that theres not a great deal in the way of predatory fish in these waters having drawn a blank in the flooded forest as evening closes in i head back towards the village each of the attacks occurred close to where people live and the creature has clearly acquired the taste for flesh so*****************i need is a bait that tastes just like human and considering their cannibalistic past there are many people here who know just the thing wade in the days when the tribespeople here were cannibalistic they called human flesh long pig because the meat tasted so much like pork so that is what i will use its obviously something that a predator would be interested in but also with moving water here what that will do that will send a nice oily trail downcurrent so not just anything here but if theres anything downstream they might sniff that and move up and investigate there he is this looks like a pacu this is interesting because this was on a*****************of meat so this supposedly vegetarian fish has just broken that habit this pacu the piranhas vegetarian relative seems to like the taste of flesh there we go so much for the vegetarian pacu if the pacu are eating pork then they could just as easily go for human flesh aaah so are they now taking on the behavior of their deadly relative the piranha im thinking that maybe i might have dismissed the pacu as the possible perpetrator of these attacks too soon in its normal habitat the amazon it is a vegetarian but it certainly has the weaponry to inflict serious damage on flesh all it would need would be a motive now if it turns out*****************there is not enough of its normal kind of food here then its gonna do what any animal would do in that situation which is to eat anything it can find in order to survive where piranhas are concerned small means deadly but pacu can grow much bigger here in papua new guinea theres virtually no commercial fishing and theres very little under the water in the way of predators so its quite possible that after only years youd find a bigger pacu living here than anything youd find in the amazon wade so is this yet another example of an introduction gone wrong especially as the attacks only started after the pacus arrival in the sepik river in*****************native south america there are or more fish species that share the common name pacu the one that has been introduced into papua new guinea is among the largest when young this pacu mimics the red-bellied piranha but as they grow they lose their red coloration and transform into formidable beasts pacu are armed with jaws powerful enough to crush the hard nuts that fall from trees these jaws are more than capable of ripping through soft human tissue if it were to resort to piranha-type behavior this river system would be forever transformed a vegetarian turned carnivore may be scientifically shocking but out here transformation is a way of life singing in native language tribespeople turn themselves into*****************meet up with alphonse he tells me that since their introduction the pacu have been devastating the river system wade so youre saying that before the pacu was here this whole area even in the high water like now was covered with floating weed floating grass - yeah - and thats now gone do the crocodiles have a problem with the pacu these floating islands are the remnants of what once covered the entire lake the pacu are quite literally eating the native species of the sepik river out of house and home but it is not only the grass that they are eating - really - yeah - youve seen that - yeah all the fish from this lake the tale of destruction gets worse and worse i know the pacu eat the small fish the pacu are eating fish they are attacking snakes as they swim across the*****************snakes is what the bird even water birds arent safe small ducks have been eaten as they paddle around - duck - duck the question is does everything include a particular part of the male anatomy aaah to find out exactly what big pacu are capable of i need to catch one so now im changing tack and heading deeper into the flooded forest sepik river people are extremely superstitious and believe that hostile spirits reside in the middle of these forests for them this is a menacing place what were doing is were paddling very very quietly through this area of flooded trees here and theres some signs of fish ive actually seen some fish chewing the ends*****************the weeds and some fish actually swirling underneath these nut trees so its just moving slowly and just casting close under the trees there are signs of pacu everywhere the sound of fruit hitting the water alerts them and they race in to eat it wade another catch but the red coloration tells me that again its a juvenile maybe i have to go further in although i find myself drawn in to local superstition im more concerned about what is lurking among the root tangles the heat in here is overwhelming and the trees cut out any breeze so the humidity is oppressive this is very different from fishing by the village there it doesnt matter you make*****************noise theyre used to the noise here the only noise they are listening for is the sound of falling nuts anything else other than that is going to scare them away personally i really enjoy this sort of close-quarters fishing where youre relying on stealth to get close to the fish youre not sort of making a lot of noise and just casting a long way and the only way you can get your bait into these areas is by getting in close another catch but this time the pull on the line suggests a larger pacu not wanting to put my hands anywhere near those jaws i use a long-handled grip to lift it out theyre getting bigger*****************bigger the fishs muscular body makes it capable of bursts of speed it can attack and make a quick get away without being seen thats not the size that i want to catch i want to catch two maybe three times the length of that but thats good to see anyway as evening rolls in i head back to the village word has spread of my investigation and a fisherman has come to see me his name frances samben is familiar speaking pidgin as he talks i realize that this is the man the newspapers claim was killed by the ball cutter aaah the stories that i heard he didnt survive the encounter but im very pleased to say*****************in reality although this was a pretty terrifying experience by all accounts he did actually live to tell the tale wade although the rumors of sambens death were exaggerated the attack did leave him hospitalized and in agony the fish was large and incredibly powerful the bite was not a clean cut like a piranhas but tore and ripped his flesh aaah and he struggled to fight it off this echoes the story told to me by nick sarkat this giant relative of the piranha is as i thought growing to quite a size and with teeth to match i begin fishing again now fully aware of the strength of this creature but the difficulty will not be bringing*****************in or even landing it what worries me most is getting close to those jaws yeah yeah big one big one big one there it is look at that its really big its really big this could be the one ive been looking for i know theres snags on the bottom im trying to keep it away from that yeah just see it this black water you can just see it down there yeah yeah yeah oh yes just keep it away from stuff on the bottom but theres also peoples houses in the water keep it away from that for the moment its in open water thats good ill get it well and truly tired out before i*****************different from the small ones the small ones have a very dramatic red belly which on this have sort of faded away to this rather light orange but the biggest difference is aah gosh very muscular fish he just gave a bit of a kick there this is all muscle here so its a very strong fish very powerful but im just ooh im just trying to look at the business end here just look at that on the small one they were quite delicate teeth on here i mean those are real crushers what this fish normally feeds on in the amazon is seeds and nuts they often have tough cases to be opened so these teeth basically theyre nutcrackers this thing really does look like a giant piranha but the teeth on this not designed for cutting but for crushing and tearing seeing those teeth reminds me of*****************of the stories ive been told about the attacks on people aah those teeth really do look uncannily like human teeth and to be bitten by those i think that would be a very creepy experience it would be just like being bitten by a person they say when a piranha bites you when it actually bites you dont know its happening because its such a clean cut but this would be a very jagged messy tear and i think youd certainly know about this when this bit you and if these fish hear something splashing in the water they dont go heading in the opposite direction like other fish they come heading for that sound with those teeth*****************im left in no doubt that the pacu is the ball cutter a vegetarian turned man-eater an outsize piranha with a taste for human flesh an alien invader running amok dominating entire stretches of the sepik river the river people now accept that the ball cutter is something they have to live with its just a graphic example of the
