Demon Fish,Goliath Tigerfish,Hydrocynus goliath,"In an African river there lurks a super predator.
A creature with the combined
strength, speed and ferocity
of all the river monsters
I have ever encountered...
..creating the most horrific yet perfect
killing machine in all of the world’s rivers.
Something bit this fish right in half.
My name is Jeremy wade,
biologist and extreme fisherman.
I'm on the trail of this terrifying monster.
And it's going to take all my skills as a fisherman
to capture one.
(Child sings in local language)
This is a story from the heart of Africa...
..of a cursed beast that preys
on the unsuspecting.
Its powers are Legendary,
its ferocity the stuff of nightmares.
On the banks of an African river,
a young girl is playing.
(Sings to herself
She enters the water as she has done
hundreds of times before.
Around her waist is a belt
made from shiny bottle caps.
What she doesn't know is that today,
in this spot, there lurks a monster.
A creature of terrifying appearance,
like a relic from prehistoric times.
Armed with bone-crunching jaws
as powerful as a hyena's,
it is as secretive as a crocodile
and as deadly as a great white shark.
(Sings softly)
This super predator is only found in
the most inaccessible part
of the most inaccessible river on Earth.
Very few outsiders have ever heard of it.
Even many of the locals have never seen it.
I'm heading to Central Africa,
to the Congo River,
to track down and catch
one of these elusive killers
to see if this creature
really does deserve its reputation
as a supreme underwater predator.
The first thing a fisherman does when he goes
to a new place is to check out the river.
But nowhere else in the world would you expect
to be greeted by a sight anything at all like this.
This massive river is second only
in flow and area to the Amazon,
draining a huge swathe of Africa
half the size of the US.
That's the Congo River.
To reach this point it has run nearly
3,000 miles, crossed the Equator twice,
and narrowed from ten miles at its widest
to around a mile here,
where it splits the two war-ravaged capital cities
of Kinshasa and Brazzaville.
From here it plummets nearly 1,000ft
in a series of rapids
to the Atlantic Ocean almost 300 miles away.
And wherever there is a river
there are humans hard-wired to seek out its fish.
I meet up with Wedda, one of only a handful
of fishermen that choose to fish these waters.
Lovely little miniature fish here.
Because this is a very delicate...
Yes, yes, yes, I've got two! I've got two!
Whoa! Look at this.
Because this is a very, very whippy
bit of bamboo here,
you can actually feel these things
going ding, ding, ding!
I got two.
Two fish. Look at that.
My first fish in the Congo. Fantastic.
Kaki. These are the Kaki fish again.
That's exciting.
It’s always significant, your first fish.
It's hard to believe but many species of fish
can survive fast-flowing rapids like these.
Wedda is one of only a handful of fishermen
who choose to fish these waters.
I'm seeing what the local guys use here.
I'm slightly embarrassed using such gear,
which is very expensive in comparison.
I actually think this will stand a chance
of getting out large fish from here
which the bamboo and lighter line
doesn't do, perhaps.
The creature I'm pursuing
is a voracious predator...
There's the hook.
..that not only attacks the small fish
these fishermen are after...
..but will also take a chunk out of a crocodile.
It's the Goliath tiger fish.
Not just one of the top predators here,
but among the most ferocious freshwater
predators in all the world’s rivers.
Goliath tiger fish are said to grow six feet long
and weigh well in excess of 100Ibs.
They have jaws packed with
razor-sharp interlocking teeth.
And with their streamlined body and huge tail,
they are capable of incredible bursts
of speed when striking prey.
Their ferocity when hunting is Legendary.
The fishermen tell me
there's someone I should meet
who has a unique way of fishing these waters.
This is Philippe Tenta.
He fishes these rapids...with a net.
That is the scale of a goliath tiger fish
which he caught the day before yesterday.
- Combien de kilo?
- Trente kilo.
- Trente kilo? Ici?
- Oui.
whoo.
70lbs. Here. That's a big old tiger fish.
Teeth on it probably like that, you know, so...
Just the thought of that kind of fish
in this kind of water.
You don't get much more extreme.
He's about to check his nets.
So you've got cable
where it's going over the rocks.
Here we go. Here's the net coming in.
As would be expected, fishing with nets in such
turbulent water is not without its problems.
(Low chatter)
The net's actually... It’s stuck.
I have no idea what he plans to do about it.
But I wasn't expecting that.
Jumping into these waters
is nothing short of suicidal.
But I realise now that this is something
he must do on a daily basis.
If people call me an extreme fisherman,
what does that make him?
I know he knows what he's doing
but to me it looks the most insanely
dangerous way to make a living.
Swimming in this super-sized
washing machine-type water,
with a net which is designed to catch things.
All this effort
and there's actually nothing in this net.
We're just gonna redeploy a fresh net.
And it is just...just mind-boggling.
You just wouldn't get me doing that.
That kind of fishing seems very reckless to me
but this is a country where people are forced
to go to extreme lengths simply to survive.
Philippe tells me about a man whose father
was attacked by a goliath tiger fish.
So I head to a suburb of Brazzaville,
the capital of the Republic of Congo,
to meet Jean-Pierre Montbeli,
a fisherman with a story to tell.
(Speaks in local language)
(Speaks in local language)
He shows me a macabre souvenir,
a scale that he took from the massive
goliath tiger fish that attacked his father.
It sounds like he was a specialist fisherman
for tiger fish.
He was fishing on his own.
He didn't come back one day and...
They are known to jump out of the water.
They're very fast.
They have just these wickedly sharp teeth.
Some time later, they found the boat,
but with nobody in.
But there was a fish in the boat
with a hook in its mouth.
when they looked, some distance away,
his body was there as well.
The thing that's horrifying is it sounds like...
..there were marks on his father's throat.
It sounded like he was standing up in the boat.
A freak accident. It sounded like the fish jumped
out of the water and bit him on the throat.
Montbeli's story raises a few questions.
But this is the second account of
a goliath tiger fish attacking and killing a person.
I've come down to the market,
which is something I always try and do.
The reason I do this is it's just
such a great clearing-house for information
about boats, fishermen, and also about fish.
There's actually a fish in Africa
called the African bonytongue,
which is a relative of the Arapaima,
which lives in the Amazon.
It’s a bit like the way the piranhas
are relatives of the goliath tiger fish here.
All this seems very strange, the fact you've got
relatives living thousands of miles apart.
But it's all evidence of the fact that Africa
and South America used to be joined.
It's a bit of an arms race down there.
In order to survive,
the fish have had to get tooled up.
Sharp teeth, poisonous spines,
and a bolt of electricity
are all mechanisms that have evolved.
(Conversation in local language)
- Makunga.
- Makunga.
I'm starting to see some of the weird and
wonderful fish from this river. Makunga, this one.
Argh!
Oooh!
Very toothy. Argh!
(Speaks local language)
This is an electric catfish.
This is an electric catfish. It’s still alive.
He got his finger in its mouth.
Ah, the tail. And that's OK?
OK. Ah!
But here... Zzzz!
OK, OK.
But to stand any chance of catching a goliath,
I need to head upstream
to a less-densely populated part of the river.
I want to see for myself if this fish deserves
its reputation as an indiscriminate killer.
Success in fishing is largely about preparation
and I use the journey north
to begin the groundwork.
Catching the fish is about getting
local intelligence.
There's no way you can get that
without talking to people.
Where I'm going,
they're not gonna speak English.
Having left the capital,
not many will speak French.
So I'm brushing up on my Lingala, which is
the language they speak on the Congo River.
It’s the trade language that everybody speaks
as well as the other little local languages.
The goliath tiger fish is the ultimate
freshwater predator,
combining characteristics from all the other
river monsters I've ever battled.
It has the bloodthirsty reputation of the piranha,
dentition more fearsome than the payara,
the cunning of the wels catfish,
and the strength of the piraiba.
Add to that, the athleticism of the arapaima
and a bony head to rival that of the alligator,
and it's clear I'm going to have to draw on
all of my past experiences to catch one.
Basically, I've got some pretty serious
treble hooks.
I'll be using this kind of wire.
If I used ordinary fishing line down to the hooks
the goliath tiger fish will chomp through it
so I'm using this kind of stuff.
It’s a breaking strain of 135lbs.
Just 100 miles upstream from Brazzaville
we arrive in the section of river
where the young girl was attacked
and killed by a goliath tiger fish.
But that was on the opposite bank
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
And I don't have papers for the DRC.
With the country still experiencing unrest,
I can't risk going there.
I stop and chat to some fishermen.
They show me a tiny goliath tiger fish
that they have just caught.
It looks like a piranha
but this is just a baby goliath tiger fish.
These things grow to the size of a person.
This confirms that it could be
a good place to start fishing.
So we've got a lump of rock here, a cliff.
Some boulders at the bottom.
The current comes down,
gets deflected out into the middle.
And we've got this nice eddy here.
So I'm actually fishing off the back of the boat,
letting the back current take it.
But it's classic ambush predator country.
I've got the bait about 50 yards down
from the boat.
I'm feeling hopeful. Something could take that.
- (whizz of line unreeling)
- Fish on! Fish on!
Argh!
The bait went round the corner.
I lost sight of the float, I lost sight of the float.
And I just pulled on the line. I was retrieving it.
Suddenly, there's a wrench on the rod.
Ah, look at that.
That's tiger fish.
There we go - chung, chung, chung.
It would have had a really good
mouthful of that...
..of the hook as well.
But...
failed to get a good hook-up.
That fish was on for two or three seconds.
That's sort of par for the course with these fish.
But I'm just looking up the wire here.
You can see, as it was running away,
the slime off the fish, some of it,
left itself on the wire trace there.
So those are the tantalising clues...
..about the fish that was on the end of this line,
which I never saw.
But it's left a little bit of itself on the wire there.
A little further upriver is the village of Maipili
where I set up camp.
Just pulling into a little village here.
One of these very large ''baleiniers''
they call them. Big whale boat.
On its way down river buying up
firewood and charcoal, by the look of it.
Plus people jumping on for a lift.
As night draws in,
I 'm left to ponder my near miss.
I had the right spot,
but I had underestimated the animal.
It just spat out my treble hook with contempt.
I've been talking to some of the people here.
They say, ''Just use loads of those.
Maybe ten on the line. Something will hold.''
But it's not just a case of the more the merrier.
I think that might hook something
fairly well, possibly.
But that amount of metalwear
might actually put something off
from actually coming along
and taking the bait in the first place.
The other thing is,
if something grabs hold of that,
the pressure that I'm exerting
is divided over nine points.
On the other hand, something like that...
It’s a bit of compromise.
I've got a big treble hook on the end.
Then I've got a single hook further up.
If just that single hook gets a hold,
I've got a lot of pressure that can actually
work that into the bone of the fish's mouth.
The goliath's reputation as a fierce predator
has immortalised it in local culture.
Known by the Congolese as mbenga,
it crops up again and again in tales of mutilation,
human death and sorcery.
The next day,
I head out with a more substantial rig.
I've got some artificial lures with me
but everybody here tells me this predator
is most likely to hit a bait that is alive.
(Speaks French) OK.
Goliath tiger fish are active hunters.
As well as having good eyesight,
they can detect vibrations in the water
which can lead them to prey.
But does the mbenga
intentionally target people?
Or is there another reason to explain
the attacks that I've heard about?
I've just got this on the clicker, on the ratchet.
If it's actually in the full current
that's just pulling it away,
but the fact that that is just holding nicely...
..is good.
It’s in a little quiet pocket of water,
relatively quiet, out in the current.
That's what I'm looking for.
It’s where a predator would wait
without expending much energy,
where there's not too much current.
Just for future reference,
just getting a fix on where we are.
Cos this is...
This just feels like a good spot.
Right.
It might be off. Damn, it's off!
Ahh!
No question about me putting pressure
on that or not.
The float just shot under.
That fish was tearing away.
Argh!
wow.
Look at that. Look at that.
Phew!
That's the kind of thing you'd expect to see
if you're shark fishing.
This is freshwater.
Something down there just bit this fish in half.
One thing that's going through my mind,
I've heard stories of people getting attacked.
Just looking at the state of this fish,
it really does make you realise
what a mess that would make of a person,
if it went for your arm or your leg
or anywhere else.
So far, the numbers just aren't in my favour.
Not many people have really fished for these
on rod and line.
But they say it's...three or four out of ten
that you hook, you'll get in.
Some people say it's even less than that.
So, for me, it's nought out of two so far.
Sometimes, they will actually jump
in the early stages.
This one didn't jump. It was just going deep.
The fish has left a slime trail up the trace.
There you go.
This line here is 200lb breaking strain.
No stretch.
I was just hanging on for all I was worth.
I mean, it's just...
..such a fearsome creature in so many ways.
Not just the force of the teeth, but also
the strength of the body, which I've now felt.
Like the girl I heard about
who had a fish grab her torso...
(Sings)
The morning after
I'm called to meet the village elders.
They have stories to tell me about attacks
by mbenga on people from the village.
(Speaks French)
The story that is emerging is that if you live here
and you go to the water every day
then there are certain...
things that you should try not to do.
(Speaks French)
Anything that goes in the water
that moves, creates a disturbance...
(Speaks French)
- If you put a baby in the water...
- (Speaks French)
It seems that the sound of splashing
in the water attracts them.
But it wasn't just the sound that attracted it
to the little girl who was killed across the river.
They're being bitten on the hands and arms.
Anything that shines, a shiny watch
or bracelet or something, there is a risk.
On that day she was wearing a belt
around her waist made from shiny bottle caps.
Her waist is exactly where she was attacked.
It is only now, when I find out why
she was wearing the belt,
that the tragedy of this story becomes clear.
(Speaks French)
There is a type of traditional protection -
it sounds like a wristlet or an amulet...
- (Speaks French)
- ..and it will protect you
against carnivorous fish,
also hippopotamus, crocodiles.
It’s sort of like a good-luck charm.
So, I guess these are people
who actually go to the water a lot.
They go there to fish,
to wash their clothes, their pots and pans.
You never know what's within a few feet of you.
So, in that kind of situation,
you need all the protection you can get.
The tragic irony of the girl's death
is that the belt was given to her
by her parents to ward off evil spirits.
But it ended up attracting
the predator that killed her.
Fred has been my boatman
for the past two weeks now.
He has helped me understand the spirituality
that swirls around this region,
like the currents in the river.
Together, we fish every hour...
..along huge stretches of the river.
But the fish seem to have vanished.
It's as though they were never here.
I change location and I change rigs and bait.
But nothing.
I continue asking the locals
and they direct me further north.
Very few things are put down to
accident or chance.
If you're bitten by a goliath tiger fish, it's because
the spirit of a sorcerer was in that fish
and it made the fish do that for some reason.
Maybe someone's put a curse on you
for whatever reason.
When you're actually fishing for one,
and not catching one,
you actually do start to think that...
..maybe this isn't a real fish at all.
Maybe it is purely...
..a mythological beast,
a figment of the collective imagination.
Because, at the moment,
there doesn't seem to be anything down there.
But I know it is more than a myth.
Because everyone I speak to
has a different story
about somebody who has been attacked.
(Speaks French)
I've just asked if they know of anybody having
any accidents with goliath tiger fish.
They were gesturing like this
on the arm and on the leg.
And it sounds like further upriver...
It seems to be a common occurrence -
there are people around
who have been bitten by them.
(Men singing)
After weeks of no results,
it's difficult to keep my focus.
But I have to because just one lapse
in concentration
and I could miss the chance when it comes.
This fish is basically a scaled-up piranha.
And once it gets to a case
of being close quarters,
I'm going to have to be very careful.
I'm going to have to really watch my step
and just take extreme care.
That is where this fishing
just has a totally other dimension.
Part of me's hoping that float's gonna disappear
and the line's gonna go screaming out.
But part of me's thinking, ''well...''
(Ratchet whirs rapidly)
It might jump, might jump.
Watch that line on the rocks.
It’s a smaller one.
Hey!
That's what they do, that's what they do.
That's three takes and no fish.
Three takes, no fish.
That's so close, so close, so close, so close.
This was a really lively bait.
Ah, yeah.
That's another fish...
(Frustrated groan)
I'm thinking, with hindsight, if I'd had more
ironmongery in there, that might have...
(Groans)
You know, days and days go by,
nothing happens, nothing happens,
and then one is there.
It just comes out of nowhere
and it's gone in a matter of seconds.
Damn! If I put this fish on, just rigged up,
normally I could have had it,
I could have bloody had it.
If I'd had...
I think I need to get another bait out there
pretty soon.
I don't know if we've got any good baits.
That was the good bait.
It is an odd thing about this fish.
It definitely does exist.
But you can almost reach a situation,
both myself and the local people,
where you sort of forget about it.
You think it doesn't exist
because you don't see it.
You hear about it, but you don't see it.
Then suddenly, it's right in front of you
and it's tearing into flesh.
If I had one fish at least under my belt now
I could accept this a bit philosophically.
But I've just been here now for so many days.
I've had three chances.
I've just caught nothing
the whole time I've been here.
It really does feel like a...
It really does feel like a test of character
and I feel that I'm failing at the moment.
It looks like I'm going to go home empty-handed,
having come all this way.
And that is just so demoralising.
It’s like the fish is taunting me, almost.
The fish is...
There's just enough of a sign of the fish...
..to get the hopes up, and then just dashed.
I head back to the village,
knowing that I need more help
if I'm not to go home empty-handed.
The elders tell me about an old man
who not only protects them from danger
but also brings them luck.
Right, this is the house of the feticheur,
the local...the witch doctor.
(Speaks French)
His assistants appear first.
while we wait in silence for him to emerge,
I wonder if the man held in such reverence
by the villagers
will have the power to change my fortunes.
(Man cries out)
The people of Central Africa hold feticheurs
like this man in very high regard.
His knowledge has been passed down
over generations
and his powers lie in his ability
to call on the spirits.
He uses substances from the forest
to create the potions.
(Speaks local language)
(Speaks French)
Ah. OK.
(Speaks local language)
I have no idea what this will involve.
But for a small payment,
I'm hoping he can change my fortunes.
what he's asking for is success in the fishing,
but also protection from the fish.
This is a dangerous fish.
I'll try and get one of these fish
and put it back alive,
but that does carry something of a risk.
It’s sort of a lucky charm.
I'm thinking I'm gonna need all the help I get
in the next few days.
(Rattling)
(Speaks local language)
(Man speaks local language)
(Applause)
The ceremony finishes
with the villagers thanking the spirits.
(Singing)
I'm still not too sure what to think
about the ceremony with the witch doctor.
But, if nothing else, Fred seems a lot happier.
(Sings)
It's as though he knows something that I don't.
we head out with a renewed sense of purpose.
Fred explains to me in more detail
exactly what the witch doctor said.
He has consulted a spirit of a dead fisherman.
And he has said that the place to catch the fish
is to come all the way up here from the village
and then work down.
I'm actually quite superstitious at times.
You do something which actually,
technically has no bearing on your fishing.
But you have a good result.
And here, I suppose it's the equivalent of
praying, in a way, talking to the ancestors.
If you do that and you have a good result
or you return safely,
then you'll keep doing that
and you will believe that is the reason
you return safely from your fishing trip.
The people of this village have spoken
to the spirits on our behalf.
They say this is the place to come.
I've been here for three weeks now
and I've had three hits,
but still nothing tangible
to show for all my efforts.
(whirs)
Fish on!
Fred, the net.
OK, I've got to just get a...
keep pressure from above cos
there's rocks and I've got...
It’s gonna jump, it's gonna jump.
That's the float. we're gonna see the fish
very soon, gonna see it very soon.
There it is. That's a good fish. Look at that.
The net, the net, the net.
Careful, Fred, careful, careful, careful.
Right, we want to be very careful now.
Ready with the net? we want to get the head in.
La tete, la tete.
Ooh. Securez la poisson.
Bon.
I've got her.
OK.
What we've gotta worry about now is
it biting its way out.
We got the fish, we got the fish.
Right, now, just a moment.
Is there anything in this or not?
I put it in this morning.
Like the feticheur said it was under my pillow.
Today...I took it with me fishing.
I want to do something that fishermen
never do when they catch these -
have a look at it then release it alive,
back into the river.
The mouth is going, the fish is breathing. Good.
And the gills are going. That's good.
This water is nicely aerated.
That's a good thing as well.
Now, those teeth.
That will take lumps out of other fish,
it will take lumps out of crocodiles
and there are stories, well documented,
about taking lumps out of people.
wow. There we go.
What a freshwater monster this thing is.
What I'm looking at here
is the ultimate piranha.
Those teeth just like a piranha's. Triangular.
Sharps blades down the side
and they interlock almost like scissors.
They will just cut a lump out.
Two big differences, though.
One is, piranhas hunt in packs.
This is a solitary hunter.
The other thing is the size.
People who think the piranhas are scary,
if they saw one of these things,
their nightmares might be populated
by a slightly different animal.
One sort of diabolical anatomical
detail on this fish
is that it hasn't just got one hinge on its jaw.
It’s got a double hinge. It’s got one hinge here.
It’s got another hinge there,
which enables it to open that jaw much wider.
So it can almost open like that
and just come straight in
and take a really huge bite out of its prey.
It’s just a murderous animal, this thing.
This fish may look inactive now,
but once it's revived a bit, there's a danger
it could slice me at any moment.
I actually don't want to let it go too soon,
even though there's a risk to me
if I stay in the water too long beside it.
what I don't want is for this fish to
swim into the powerful water
and not be able to hold itself upright.
It will just roll belly-up and get
battered on some of these rocks here.
So I want it to be completely recovered
before it goes.
I want it to be able to swim off,
keeping itself vertical unaided.
- (Speaks French)
- Ah. Oh, yes.
- (Speaks French)
- No, no, no.
(They speak French)
We're having a discussion
because Fred thought
that we'd take it back to the village
for everyone to eat.
- That is quite a nice idea.
- (Speaks French)
He tells me,
''This fish has been given to us by God. ''
(Speaks French)
He said even for the feticheur
who gave me the charm,
told me I'd have success in the fishing,
send him a piece of the meat.
It's not just our village,
the people over the river have helped.
It would be...
It would make everybody happy.
But it wouldn't make me happy...
well, it would, in one way. But it would make me
more happy to put this back.
It’s gonna upset him as well,
if he sees this swim away.
I'm trying to explain the important thing for me
is to see it, and not to kill it.
I think it's very important that...
..animals that we find frightening in appearance,
that we try and understand them.
we don't just hack them to pieces
and kill them and look at the body.
I want to look at this thing alive
and then see it swim off.
If the fish dies because it
has really exhausted itself
fighting against me
and in that very wild, rocky water,
if the fish dies,
we'll take it back for everyone to eat.
If it recovers, if it can support itself,
I'm going to let it go.
So we now just wait and see.
Looking now at some of the marks on its head
I think it bashed itself on the rocks
while fighting with me.
It’s possible that it might die.
But what I wanna do is
give it the best chance possible.
To me the mbenga ranks as one of
the most difficult fish I've ever caught.
But I don't think it deserves its reputation
as an indiscriminate killer.
Each attack involves splashes
or bright, shiny objects in the water,
which, to a goliath tiger fish,
resembles its normal food - other fish -
and it responds in the only way that it knows.
After an hour, the decision is taken from me
as I feel the life slipping away from this monster.
No, it's not going to make it.
So, I mean, the good thing is, although the fish
has died, it won't be going to waste.
To the people of the Congo,
the mbenga is much more than just a fish.
It is a spirit that pervades their folklore.
Yet many people here, I now realise,
have never seen this monster in the flesh.
(Grunts with effort)
I begin to suspect that, for Fred,
returning this fish
would have meant much more
than just losing a meal.
(Excited shouting)
Bringing this fish out of the shadows into
the light of day has been a monumental task.
It's easy to tell myself now that my success
was down to my persistence.
But I still wonder how much was down to factors
outside my control or understanding.
No, no...
OK. whoa!
(Cheering)
(Excited chatter)
It’s never good when a fish dies, but, you know,
When it gets that kind of reaction when you
bring it in, that's a big meal for lots of people.
There's over 200 people in this village
and they'll all have a piece.
A lot of them won't have seen a fish like that
or not a good-size one.
They've heard about it, it is a legend.
But they don't see them very often so, you know,
if a fish has to die or a fish does die,
at least...a reaction like that
is some sort of compensation.
It’s not the ending that I wanted,
but...it is fitting in a way.
(Cheering)","Hydrocynus goliath, also known as the goliath tigerfish, giant tigerfish, or mbenga, is a very large African predatory freshwater fish of the family Alestidae.


== Distribution ==
Goliath tigerfish (Hydrocynus goliath) is one of five recognized African species of the Hydrocynus genus and is found in the Congo River Basin (including Lualaba River and Lake Upemba), and Lake Tanganyika. The type locality is the city of Mbandaka in the Main Congo, where it was discovered in 1898 by French explorer Boulenger. They are typically found in highly oxygenated fast-flowing waters such as those found in deep river channels and open lakes, making them strong swimmers able to capture prey even in turbulent waters.
A 2011 study which reconstructs the phylogenetic history of genus Hydrocynus using comparisons of a protein-coding gene called cytochrome b, revealed several mtDNA clades in this region, suggesting a higher tigerfish species richness than traditionally recognized. The study’s analyses indicate that populations of H. goliath may have been prevented from upstream dispersal in the geologic past by knickpoints, or sharp changes in the channel bed slope, in the Luvua river. This prevention of upstream dispersal would restrict H. goliath to the Congo River Basin as reflected in the modern range of the species. Four additional species (H. vittatus and three unknown species) appear to be present in this Basin, while two (H. vittatus and an unknown species) appear to be present in Lake Tanganyika.
Based on the study’s sequence comparisons, H. goliath possesses low nucleotide diversity, suggesting that existing populations originate from a historically small effective population which underwent rapid population growth at some point in the past. Additionally, a high haplotype diversity value indicates that its expansion may have undergone a more recent expansion in its population range and size.


== Description ==

The goliath tigerfish has a characteristic silvery gray dorsum and flanks, with a thunniform body plan similar to that of tuna, featuring black adipose fins. The goliath tigerfish is described as the ""Monster Fish of the Congo"" by a 2008 documentary by National Geographic, a reflection of its monster-like qualities and of its perception by local people and hunters. This large-toothed, highly predatory fish grows to an average length of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) and a weight of 50 kg (110 lb). The largest recorded specimen weighed 70 kg (154 lb), and they can reach a maximum recorded length of about 2 m (6.6 ft), making them the largest of the tigerfish of genus Hydrocynus. 
In addition to being the largest in body size of their genus, they also have incredibly large conical teeth. Due to their predatory nature, they possess well-developed pharyngeal teeth similar to those of sharks and piranhas.Their teeth are spaced out along the jaw and shaped like daggers in order to facilitate biting pieces out of prey fish or tearing prey into smaller pieces for digestion. The premaxilla holds six to seven teeth while the dentary or lower jaw holds five, for a total of 12 to 20 upper teeth plus 8 to 14 lower teeth. Its teeth fit into distinct grooves along its jaws, interlocking together with the smallest teeth found at the very back of the jaws. In each jaw quadrant, all teeth are replaced at the same time over the course of about five days.  On average each of its teeth can grow up to 2.5 cm (1 in), according to biologist and television presenter Jeremy Wade, which is comparable to the tooth size of a Great White shark. These massive jaws and teeth are what sets this species apart from all other tigerfish of the genus Hydrocynus and make for easy identification, especially given its endemism to the Congo Basin.


== Reproduction ==

Despite being mostly solitary hunters, female goliath tigerfish migrate together and breed near each other on riverbanks or lakeshores. Thousands of eggs are laid among thick vegetation to protect the eggs and the young from predators, given that goliath tigerfish are not attentive parents. Infant fish feed on animal plankton during their larval stage before transitioning to small fish and eventually an adult diet of larger fish. Juvenile fish grow quite slowly, averaging four to six inches of growth per year. It can take up to ten years for a juvenile tigerfish to reach its full adult size. 


== Diet ==
Hydrocynus goliath is a piscivore, feeding on any fish it can overpower, including smaller members of the same species. Their huge, powerful, rigid teeth make them one of the most ferocious predators of the Congo basin, dangerous for the smaller fish they prey on as well as for the hunters who attempt to capture them for sport and for food.  They have been known to attack larger animals, taking ""chunks"" out of large fish, crocodiles, humans, or even each other in desperate times. 
When hunting, this fish uses the calmer eddies of the rapids to ambush its prey, using its keen sight to detect prey. When a target is noticed, the fish accelerates to chase it down. The Nile crocodile is the only known natural predator of mature goliath tigerfish. Humans are also considered predators as they hunt tigerfish for food and sport.


== Interaction with and significance to humans ==

A number of incidents have been reported in the Congo of this fish attacking humans. This reputation, combined with its strength, has earned it an almost mythical status among anglers, and it has been called the ""greatest freshwater gamefish in the world"". Hunters and fishermen in the Congo River Basin often spend entire days battling these huge fish. Its enormous size and shearing teeth make it powerful and difficult to capture, earning it the title of one of the world’s greatest sports fishing challenges in sports fishing magazines.
Throughout the Congo, the goliath tigerfish is known by its native Swahilli name ""mbenga,"" which translates to ""dangerous fish."" Native people believe the fish to be an evil spirit which is to be avoided, especially at the start of a journey on water. 
The goliath tigerfish is one of many fishes that plays an important role in the diet and economy of African countries. In the Central African Republic, a study investigates how to manage infestations of Dermestes beetles in the dried fishes which are crucial for supplying protein to Central Africans.  The study shows that tigerfish are susceptible to the development of Dermestes, with considerable losses to the fish product as it eats through the skin, lays larvae, and contaminates the fish as a food source. Infestation of dried fishes comes with financial loss for Central and South African economies, with an estimated annual loss of £750,000 ($1,000,000 USD) in South Africa specifically. Dried fish carrying the Dermestes and their larvae can go on to damage timber, cotton, linen, and other materials. Though methods of prevention through traditional management of dried fishes were investigated, the development of the Dermestes subspecies found in dried tigerfish has not yet been effectively reduced. 
In addition to pests, bacteria is commonly found in dried tigerfish. To combat this, many sellers use either traditional methods or toxic pesticides that increase the shelf life. Researchers recommend further study regarding the specific bacterial concentrations at each stage of the processing of dried fish, as well as training for the sellers regarding safer handling practices. 


=== In the home aquarium ===
The goliath tigerfish is sometimes kept as a display fish in home aquarium setups, however due to their enormous size, often times reaching over 84 in (2,100 mm) in length they are not suitable, except among the most experienced fishkeepers with the ability to house them. The recommended size of such a tank setup would be around 4,000 U.S Gallons. They are predatory fish with razor sharp teeth and are hostile to most other inhabitants; it's recommended to keep them alone or with larger and more boisterous species that can hold their own against the Tiger fish. When feeding, this massive fish will only feed on live prey, making feeding them difficult. 


== Conservation status ==
The current conservation status of the goliath tigerfish is unknown, but it is listed as ""least concern"" according to the IUCN Red List’s 2010 assessment.

Death Ray,Giant Freshwater Stingray,Urogymnus polylepis,"I'm Jeremy wade,
biologist and extreme angler.
From the depths of the Amazon
to the suburbs of Berlin,
I've been busy, tracking down
the world's most frightening freshwater fish...
..and uncovering the truth
about their evil reputations.
It's taking line! That's taking line!
I've tangled with man-eating catfish...
This is the one that goes after people, as well.
..swum with piranhas...
..and grappled with ferocious gar.
Agh!
My next assignment
is a beast of terrifying power.
It's spinning the boat.
It's taking the boat down.
Some people say
this is the world's biggest freshwater fish.
If my line jams, it could pull me in.
This is a monster that can stab you
with an eight-inch bayonet.
Its flesh-dissolving venom
has no known antidote.
Just catching this fish will test me to the limit.
But my aim isn't simply to measure
one of these giants.
I also want to know where it lives
and how dangerous it really is.
- I've a feeling this could be...
- Agh!
- ..my toughest challenge yet.
- Here it comes! Here it comes!
I think we're going to need a bigger boat!
In just the past few years,
a strange and possibly deadly creature
has come out of the shadows.
I've read dramatic accounts
of epic, six-hour battles...
..and heard that this predator
can inflict horrendous wounds.
Some people are even claiming
that this little-known beast
is the world's biggest freshwater fish.
The name of this monster
is Himantura chaophraya,
the giant freshwater stingray.
Shaped like a UFO, this Southeast Asian giant
is said to grow to 16ft long and 7ft across.
Some sources put its weight at over 1,300Ibs.
Even this basic information is very hard to verify.
It all sounds incredibly impressive,
but how much of this stuff can I really believe?
It seems that no-one knows how big this thing
actually grows or why.
I've encountered river stingrays before,
a thousand miles up the Amazon.
Here, they're known as
''wish you were dead'' fish,
because of their agonisingly painful sting.
But these stingrays are relatively small.
The thought of a 16-footer
sends a real shiver down my spine.
These are some examples of the wounds
caused by marine stingrays.
Typically, what you're talking about
is a very deep puncture wound,
normally to the foot or the lower leg
but sometimes higher up.
And the people generally talk about this
as being extremely painful.
As well as the actual immediate wound,
you have this very long-lasting effect
of tissue necrosis.
It's just a very painful, messy wound.
Here's one from New Zealand.
You can see here that the barbs
are actually still embedded in the leg.
The bit you can see is probably about
five, maybe six inches long.
This is in the upper leg.
This person was very lucky.
If that had been a little bit further round,
that could have punctured the femoral artery.
That could have been a fatal wound.
That could have killed him.
Note to self. ''Don't get stung. ''
This is the barb from a stingray,
actually quite a small one.
But you get the general idea.
The barb sits on top of the tail
and it whips it over its back, a bit like a scorpion,
or it can also whip it round to either side.
And looking at this, you can just see
just how wickedly sharp that point is.
The second thing is you've got
these grooves running underneath.
That is for delivering the venom
from the gland at the base here,
but also for making it
a more efficient stabbing weapon.
You’ll see exactly the same thing
on a bayonet or a combat knife.
And the third thing, looking closely at this,
you see these serrations along the edge here,
and it works on the same principle
as an arrowhead. It goes in very cleanly...
but, you know, it's going to make
a real mess when you pull it out.
Imagine being stabbed
by a large steak knife,
only this one's smeared with poison
and it really shreds your flesh
when it comes out.
Yep. I've heard that
the giant freshwater stingray
has a barb that is eight inches long,
which is a really sobering thought.
I'm quite curious to have a look at one of those,
hopefully not too close.
It's not something I want to bring back
as a souvenir in my leg.
My quest for the giant freshwater stingray
takes me to Southeast Asia.
First, to Thailand's capital, Bangkok.
Surprisingly, this huge
and potentially lethal monster
lives right under our noses.
Normally,
when looking for underwater monsters,
you're thinking hundreds of miles upriver,
in remote wilderness, but not this time.
I'm literally taking a short cab ride
from the airport
and I'm slap-bang in the middle of Bangkok
and just a few miles away from the sea.
Even more incredibly, scientists only discovered
the giant freshwater stingray
a mere 20 years ago.
Its species name, chaophraya,
comes from this very river,
running through the heart of Bangkok.
And yet this monster in our midst
is still cloaked in mystery.
I want to find out how big it really gets.
I also want to know
how far this animal travels inland.
In most people's eyes,
stingrays are sea creatures,
not river fish.
Barely an hour's drive from the capital,
I track down a story that puts me on edge...
..and reminds me that the venom of
this creature has no known antidote.
Four months ago, local fisherman Pun Sang
was surprised to hook
one of these rarely-seen giants.
For people here, such a huge fish
is a potentially lucrative catch.
(Speaks Thai)
The stingray came to the side of the river
and then wouldn't come any further.
It basically got buried in the mud.
So what he had to do was get in the water,
which was about chest-deep,
and then completely go underwater with a rope,
feed the rope through the spiracles,
the water intake of the stingray, knot the rope.
He'd managed to pull it off the bottom.
It was actually as it rose in the water
that he then felt this pain.
Argh!
The wound was actually just numb to start with.
And then just this incredible pain.
In fact, so painful that he collapsed
from the intensity of the pain
and had to crawl
the remaining distance to the house.
This was not going to go away on its own.
It did need urgent medical treatment.
As he races for help,
Pun Sang continues to bleed heavily
and almost passes out with the pain.
With no antidote available,
his chances of survival are anyone's guess.
By the time he arrives for treatment,
his condition is deteriorating fast.
- what happens at the medical centre?
- (Speaks Thai)
His heart rate spikes alarmingly.
Despite anaesthetic,
he remains doubled up in agony.
The wound, in fact,
is no more than a glancing blow.
And yet the pain proved so intense
that Pun Sang is unable to work
for the next four weeks.
He still has the very barb that impaled him.
Can I have a look at that?
Right.
well, seeing that
really does concentrate the mind.
An absolutely vicious point on that
and these horrible barbs down the side.
And I think...
you know, this is a fish
I've got to really treat with some respect.
Evidently, even a quick jab from this fish
can land you in serious trouble.
whatever it contains,
the venom seems every bit as potent
as in marine stingrays.
OK, so that actually went in about...
getting on for three inches, there,
but it was at an oblique angle, and...
So although he probably doesn't feel lucky
to have had this experience,
if that had gone in straight
and punctured the femoral artery,
that could have killed him.
Tragically, Steve Irwin,
the Crocodile Hunter, was not so lucky.
He was struck clean through the heart and died.
while this freak accident
happened way out at sea,
the chilling fact about the stingray I'm looking for
is that it swims up rivers,
into some of the most densely populated parts
of Southeast Asia.
And it's in these crowded waterways
that I'm about to try and meet
this monster face-to-face.
I head to a town called Samut Songkhram,
50 miles west of Bangkok
and just a few miles inland.
This tidal stretch of river
harbours some of the largest
freshwater stingrays ever caught.
This fish, the giant stingray,
was only described by scientists
just 20 years ago,
but, presumably, the people on these rivers
have known about it probably for centuries.
The problem the scientists had was getting
their hands on enough specimens to study.
what this means
is either it's a very rare animal
or it's just very, very hard
to get one out of the river.
To try and catch one of these elusive giants,
I'm teaming up
with an experienced fishing crew,
led by stingray enthusiast Boy.
Live bait is essential.
Its muscle movements
will give off the electrical signals
that stingrays use to detect their prey.
These animals are active hunters,
prowling over the riverbed in search of a meal.
Their faces are packed
with sophisticated sensors
that penetrate the mud and murk.
Potentially eight times my size,
this fish is in a different league
from anything I've tackled before.
It calls for the heaviest gear.
I'm using ultra-strong braided line,
with 30 yards of thick nylon
monofilament at the business end.
To take some of the strain,
I’ll be wearing a harness.
Good news for my arms,
but if the line digs in and jams,
I could be pulled in.
Normally, the fish can't take line
and the line will break,
but when you're using a 160Ib line,
that line isn't going to break.
I'm going to go over the side.
After Pun Sang's account,
I'm anxious to avoid this nightmare scenario.
If that's dug in, for some reason,
I've got to have Plan B.
I'm going to be strapped to that,
have a harness locked into that.
So I've got a knife.
If I'm going over the edge, the knife comes out
and just cut that line.
The fish can go. It's better than drowning.
With everything prepped,
we head for the chosen spot.
A deep pocket in the riverbed
they call ''Area 51 '',
because, as they say round here,
it's crawling with aliens.
My battle boat is rigged with four big-game rods,
including my own marlin-class outfit
that I've brought for the occasion.
If a line goes, I'm ready to hunker down,
strap in and lock horns.
To improve the odds,
Boy's put out a dozen or so extra lines,
tied to floats.
This isn't regarded as true sport fishing,
but my mission here
isn't to beat my chest or win prizes.
I simply want to see
one of these incredible animals in the flesh.
And, within minutes,
there's something big mauling our baits.
It didn't run off with the bait
but there's been a stingray on that.
Something has come along
and crushed that there,
but, then, instead of taking the bait,
it's spat it out.
Stingrays have crushing mouth parts
that leave an unmistakable imprint.
Disappointing in one sense,
but also good news.
I'm in the right place. They are down there.
The next bite's a clean take
and we are game on.
As I race to clip in, something powerful
rips out several feet of line,
then decides to tow us upriver.
It's spinning the boat.
It's taking the boat down.
I think we're going to need a bigger boat!
OK.
Right. Ah!
Oh, yeah, that is... Oh, look at that rod!
That rod is now springing back slowly.
This line shouldn't go.
The rod's a bit of an unknown quantity.
Ah!
It's my own marlin-class outfit
taking the strain.
I just have visions of this rod suddenly shattering
and getting a face full of fiberglass
and carbon fiber.
That's pulling down. That's pulling down.
There is quite a real possibility
of this thing pulling me in.
I feel like I'm trying to pull
the plug out of the river.
ALL I can do is dig in
and keep the pressure on.
After 30 exhausting minutes,
I haven't gained an inch.
Ah! Ah!
This isn't like any fishing I've ever experienced
and I start to wonder if I can cope.
Most fish, it's all over in...
five, 10 minutes, half an hour at the extreme.
You know, this...
In freshwater, something like this is just...
It's just unheard of.
with neither of us willing to give in,
it becomes a war of attrition.
Give or take the odd foot of line,
we're in total deadlock.
Be careful.
I've just been told it's one hour five minutes,
so far.
we're into about round eight now.
Oh, look at that! It's taking line.
That is taking line fast.
This thing does not like being bullied.
I decided I'd show it who's boss
and the fish is saying,
''No, no. You're not the boss.''
Ah!
Oh! That's about half an hour's
worth of work has just gone.
I've just gained about 3ft of line
and it's just taken that.
But, sometimes, when it does that,
the fish then takes a bit of a breather
and I can maybe capitalise.
For another 40 minutes,
we slug it out in a gruelling tug of war.
Right, I've got the initiative. whoa! Ah! Ah!
Then, after almost two hours, a breakthrough.
I think it's come off the bottom.
There was a sudden... Argh!
A sudden sort of break of suction.
It does feel like it is actually...
Yeah, that's definitely coming my way
a lot faster than it has done
at any time until now.
My arms are cramping up
and I'm close to breaking point,
but I've finally got the measure
of this gigantic fish.
It's about a metre and a half below the surface.
Here it comes!
I'm just seconds away from seeing
what must surely be
one of the world's greatest river monsters.
Oh!
Right, look at that. The rod went. The rod went.
I actually saw the fish.
We nearly, nearly had it in the net, but...
An almighty bang.
Oh!
My gear was built to deal with
sharks and marlin.
whatever broke this rod
could have weighed as much as 700Ibs.
I thought it was my shoulder going for a minute,
but it was the rod.
- Too long.
- The rod's too long. Yeah.
Oh, dear. That was so close.
The fish nearly came in.
we saw it. After two hours, it was off the bottom.
we were trying to get the net round it.
The rod went and the fish escaped.
It wasn't quite in the net.
And to make matters worse,
the fight has left me with a torn bicep.
ALL that suffering...
I saw the fish and it's... Oh!
ALL that for nothing. ALL that.
Oh!
It's score one to the stingray.
But my close encounter with this giant
has got me wondering.
why does this creature grow so huge?
As this photograph graphically shows,
marine stingrays
are vulnerable to attack by sharks.
But what could possibly threaten
a river stingray?
Perhaps it's no coincidence
that the rivers here are also home
to another gigantic fish.
Growing up to nine feet long
and weighing over 600Ib,
the Mekong giant catfish is a Class A monster.
Conceivably, the stingray's immense size
could be a defence strategy.
To get a close-up look at a giant Mekong,
I've come to a stocked fishing lake.
These animals are all but extinct in the wild.
This is a strong fish!
Got the line against the...
This one's giving me the run-around.
A huge tail. A huge tail on that.
But it's probably just a small one.
A very powerful sort of throbbing fight.
You can almost feel the beats of the tail.
That's a Mekong catfish.
My catch is only one-tenth the size
of what they can reach.
Nonetheless, I can see it's no ordinary catfish.
Being a catfish, it's got no scales,
but...
what's interesting, as well,
although it's a catfish,
it hasn't got feelers, barbels.
And the other thing that's interesting here
is there's no teeth in there.
There's not even anything approaching
one of these raspy pads in there.
Although this does grow very big
and well over 600Ib, it's not a predator.
This thing is a vegetarian. It's a gentle giant.
If I'm looking down from here,
I can't see any eyes.
The eyes are on the underside of the head,
very close to the corner of the mouth.
That's something that just points
to it being a bottom feeder,
rooting around vegetable matter on the bottom.
So this gummy oddball isn't a killer,
which leaves me still wondering
why the stingrays here
have evolved into such giants.
I've yet to see a chaophraya stingray.
Dead or alive.
But with Thailand's biggest fish market
just down the road,
I'm back on the hunt.
This is a vast clearing house
for everything that comes out of the sea
for hundreds of miles around.
Stingrays first evolved in the oceans.
And it could be that
the giant freshwater stingray occurs in the sea,
as well as rivers.
So we have got rays here.
I'm finding some rays.
That's not the one I'm after.
This is an eagle ray of sorts.
Yet another species of ray.
These are all marine species,
but this is bringing home
there is a huge diversity of ray species,
lots of variations on the theme.
Stingrays are clearly one of nature's
more successful designs,
but their origins, some 200 million years ago,
may come as a surprise.
A quick lesson in evolution here.
Here's a shark.
That is the classic shark mouth,
the classic shark teeth,
the shark tail.
Come to this fish here.
Shark tail.
Shark dorsal fin.
But something very different
going on at the front end.
It's flattening, becoming squashed.
Let's flip it over.
And suddenly we've got
a very different type of mouth.
Crushing plates but very different.
Gills on the bottom of the body.
Come to this fish here.
And here we have...
the same mouth, the same gills.
Flip it over.
There we have it.
A ray is basically a flattened shark,
with this long tail.
This flattened body plan,
with the eyes and water intakes on top,
is an adaptation for life on the ocean floor.
whatever its origins,
the monster I'm after continues to elude me.
After three hours of trawling,
I haven't found a single specimen.
I head to the freshwater stalls,
where the fish are still pouring in.
If there are no giant stingrays
coming out of the sea,
then perhaps I’ll find one here.
Any chaophraya here?
(Speaks Thai)
No?
So no stingray here.
I don't know how many thousands of fish
I must have seen here.
Thais really do love their fish.
They eat pretty well anything that swims.
But the freshwater ray is not here.
This could be because it's rare.
It could be because it's just hard
to get out of the river.
Maybe there is another reason I don't know of,
but I haven't found one.
To learn more about this elusive monster,
I'm meeting a scientist who has more
hands-on experience of this stingray
than anyone in the world.
Dr Ning, from ChuIalongkorn
University in Bangkok,
is one of the few people
trying to study this animal.
Our first task is to collect some water
from the bottom of the river,
some 30 feet down.
One thing I want to know
is whether this ray is a true river fish,
living in pure fresh water.
That's on the bottom.
we're only six or seven miles from the sea here,
so I'd expect the river to be quite salty.
In my mind, this puts a question mark
over claims that the giant stingray
is a true freshwater fish.
Now then, this is the moment of truth.
If this were pure seawater,
the salt meter would give me a reading of 30,
with brackish water at around 15.
So that is...right on zero,
which I'm quite surprised by.
It's very obviously tidal here.
I had my doubts about whether this thing
is a truly freshwater animal.
I think that is something that still
requires a bit of unpacking, perhaps,
but it is certainly capable of living
in water that it is absolutely fresh.
There's no trace of seawater
at this point, at the moment.
In theory, they could be even further
up these rivers.
While I'm here, I also want to find out more
about the stingray's lair.
This stretch of water is less than half a mile
from where I hooked the monster
that broke my rod.
Ugh!
Look at that. That's what's on the bottom here.
Thick mud is going to give my quarry
a big advantage.
They are going to get a very good seal
and very good suction.
I now understand why I had such a battle
to pull up this animal.
Imagine that's the stingray.
That weighs nothing. I can lift that easily.
And...
Just getting a little bit under the mud.
There we go.
And I can lift it up. Look at that.
- Argh!
- (Laughs)
So, if that stingray gets the edges
of its wings under the mud,
I'm not just lifting the stingray
but the whole bottom of the river.
One of the things I want to find out
about this fish is how heavy it gets.
For a small fish,
you put it in a bag and weigh it.
For something the size of these,
we've had to come up
with something special.
Back at Area 51, our lines are set.
And I'm hoping my luck's about to change.
As we wait for a bite,
Boy tells me an unnerving story.
..heart here.
Made by heart go bump-bump-bump.
Sweat.
- And that's the scar of it there?
- Yeah. Just here.
I've just been asking Boy
about stingray wounds, this kind of thing.
And he told me a story about how a small one
just scratched him on the finger
and he thought that's going to be fine.
15 minutes later,
the entire left side of his body's gone numb.
The heart is pounding away.
He was thinking this could be like
a snake bite, this could be fatal.
After three hours, it passed.
And I'm just thinking, you've just got to be
so careful when handling these things.
With plenty of floats out,
it's not long before I'm back in the ring.
This time, I've learnt my lesson
and switched to a shorter rod.
It's my arm that worries me.
I'm not sure it’ll take another 12 rounds.
To my relief, it's barely 20 minutes
before this one starts to surface.
The fish is coming up! The fish is coming up!
OK. OK. Are you ready, boys?
So we've got the fish here in the net.
I've finally caught one,
my first chaophraya stingray.
I keep well clear, though.
Until its sting is strapped up,
this fish is still a loaded gun.
So this is just binding the barb,
which sits in a bit of a groove.
That is binding the barb to the tail.
Once it's disarmed, we head for the bank.
Most of the body of the fish is in the water.
I haven't really properly seen this fish.
I'm really looking forward now to getting it in
and having a proper look at this animal.
The pink tinge on the belly
makes me think of the rash
that divers sometimes get
when they come up from depth.
This fish has surfaced from 30 feet down,
enough to give it a mild case of the bends,
so it's vital we release it soon.
This species is said to top 1,300Ib,
yet, as I now discover,
this is only half the story.
We've got a male. This one's a male.
The entire team is on hand to help measure
and weigh the fish.
So this one's about four and a half foot across.
It's not particularly big as they go,
but it is very big for a male.
Its sex explains why this one came up so fast.
Astonishingly, females can be up to
eight times bigger
than this full-grown male.
we've weighed it accurately,
which is quite a hard thing to do.
175Ib. Around 80kg.
For sheer weight, this is one of
the largest fish I've ever caught.
And yet, incredible as it sounds,
it's a mere min now.
It's been out of the water long enough now.
Definitely time to get it back in the water.
The males may be relatively small,
but they're still armed
with a potentially lethal sting.
Before we turn him loose,
I go in for a closer look.
This is the business end.
This is why it's called a stingray.
This sharp, pointed poisonous barb
on the tail end.
And it can throw this not only over its head,
like a scorpion,
it can throw it side to side,
so that is the weaponry seen up close.
A very impressive bit of weaponry it is, too.
OK.
This is an animal that completely
warps your normal sense of scale.
Despite catching a good-sized male,
I know that my quest is far from over.
Since it was first scientifically described,
there have been occasional reports
of large chaophraya stingrays
from far inland.
I'm leaving the tidal waterways around Bangkok
and heading up country.
Could this be where I’ll finally find my monster?
I travel 150 miles north,
following the Chao Phraya River upstream
to a town called Nakhon Sawan.
But it's late May
and the rains are starting to break.
As I begin to fish,
the weather takes a turn for the worse.
(Rumble of thunder)
For three hours, it pours without let-up.
ALL I catch is a dose of the monsoon blues.
(Rumble of thunder)
At least someone's having some luck.
Then I meet a man with an amazing tale.
This was what, just here in Nakhon Sawan?
(Speaks Thai)
This is interesting.
This is a recent capture. Only a few months ago.
I'm imagining that that wasn't easy to get out.
How long to get this out of the river?
(Speaks Thai)
Clearly, a very big fish, this. Apparently...
320kg,
which converts to something like 700Ibs,
a seriously large fish.
The story is it took 10 people,
in two boats, four hours to get it in
and it actually dragged the boat
well over a mile during that time,
so I think a bit of an epic battle and a big fish.
Looking at the man's tackle,
I'm amazed he got it in at all.
Ah, we've got a video clip someone took.
Obviously big local news.
There's people all around.
I'm no stranger to fishermen's yarns,
but the figure of around 700Ibs does ring true.
This fish was cut up and weighed
accurately for market.
It seems they only kept one piece of it.
Oh, right.
- Is this from the same fish?
- Yeah, same fish.
Ooh. Right. OK.
Even with its tip broken off,
this barb is by far the biggest I've seen.
If there are giant stingrays here,
then how much further upriver do they go?
I'm starting to wonder.
Could these creatures have penetrated
deep into the river systems,
just like their distant Amazon cousins?
Getting on for 3,000 miles long,
the mighty Mekong is Southeast Asia's
greatest river.
Until just the last 150 years,
its upper reaches remained largely
cut off from the outside world.
Even today, it still feels like a land of secrets.
If anyone can help me unlock them,
it's the fishermen
who make their living along its banks.
I'm now 1 ,000 miles upriver
and I wonder if anyone here will know
about the creature I'm looking for.
I wonder if you, fishing here,
see any chaophraya?
(Speaks Thai)
The big-sized chaophraya
or these were small fish?
Any really big ones?
(Speaks Thai)
what happened there was that the stingray
got wrapped up in the net.
This big one just broke its way through.
It sounds promising.
But I want a positive ID.
will they recognise the fish
from Nakhon Sawan?
Same fish?
(Speaks Thai)
Yeah. (Speaks Thai)
So the same fish as here?
(Man speaks Thai)
Right. This is very interesting.
I've shown the picture of the ray
that was caught at Nakhon Sawan.
Not only is it the same species,
it was also about the same size.
This was a big animal here.
That's a very encouraging bit of information.
It does bode well.
I'm going to be putting a bait
in water where these things are.
Do the fishermen here
try to catch chaophraya
or is it always an accident?
Do you... Is it a good fish to eat?
Do people eat it?
(Men speak Thai)
Ah. OK. OK.
So the stingray will come after
the small fish in the net.
It's a nuisance species.
They try and get the fish that are in your net.
They get wrapped up themselves.
Then you've got to take them out
and be very careful of the sting.
If you get a big one,
they're actually going to rip your net apart.
So they don't fish for them.
It's a nuisance fish, they call it.
I head further upriver
into even more remote country.
But the Mekong seems unwilling
to give up its secrets.
Am I looking in the wrong place, I wonder,
or fishing in the wrong season?
My right arm still aches
from the two-hour battle I fought
and my exercise routine brings little relief.
Just curious looks.
Undeterred, I travel back downriver.
with a confirmed eyewitness account,
I'm eager to take a look for myself.
I'm at a place called Nong Khai,
right on the border with Laos.
25 years ago, I was actually in this
very same bit of river. A little bit upstream.
And I was arrested by the police
on suspicion of spying.
And that cut short my entire trip.
End of fishing. End of everything.
They locked me up for the night
and confiscated all my photos.
This time round,
I'm using sophisticated sonar equipment
to scan the riverbed.
I'm looking down into the water.
I've got the sonar, 20 foot of water.
I'm trying to get a mental picture
of the underwater geography,
as my first step in looking for the stingrays.
I've actually got fish symbols straightaway,
but they're middle of the water,
unlikely to be stingrays.
Although, if there is something close
to the bottom, it could be a ray.
They don't spend all the time
just stuck right down.
Sometimes, they do actually rise off,
maybe three or four feet and glide away.
I'm convinced there are
giant stingrays down here,
but before I can unpack my rod,
there's a nasty surprise.
(whoop of siren)
One problem about here,
it's the border between Thailand and Laos.
I might have possibly strayed over the border.
I'm just going to carry on acting normal.
I suppose I have got some fairly
hi-tech gear on the boat.
I'm spying on the bottom of the river.
(whoop of siren)
OK. OK. Go in?
OK. OK.
They probably don't see that many foreigners
on the river here.
I've been waved into the side.
I've been waved into the side.
They are still very,
very keen on keeping an eye on people
who do things by this border.
The border area is just very sensitive.
That's another difficulty
in trying to find this stingray here.
The political situation.
I avoid jail, at least.
But I've no choice
but to cut short my mission...
..and head back south.
I'm starting to wonder
if I’ll ever see this elusive monster.
With one last throw of the dice,
I return to Area 51.
My hopes of actually seeing the monster
I've come to find
seem to be drifting away.
To catch this seemingly rare
and almost Legendary beast,
perhaps I need a little help from the gods.
I'm back at Samut Songkhram,
where I've already caught a full-grown male
and come painfully close to landing
a truly massive female.
Just get the rods on first.
This time, the stakes are even higher.
A team of scientists has arrived
from ChuIalongkorn University in Bangkok.
They're counting on me to provide
a live stingray for their research.
So little is known about this animal
that every catch
offers a rare chance to learn more.
The scientists will settle
for any stingray I can catch,
but, for me, this is all about seeing a true giant.
To hell with my sore arm,
I'm just hoping we've hooked a big female.
I haven't come this far to miss out.
I get the illusion now that I'm
actually bringing the fish to me.
What's actually happening
is I'm taking the boat to the fish.
The fish isn't actually going anywhere
at the moment.
what do you think? Is it a fairly good fish?
Oh, it's just actually come off the bottom!
It's a worrying sign.
Any monster worth its salt
isn't going to give up so quickly.
But then the stingray sinks back down,
switches gear and takes off upriver.
Oh!
The drag on this reeI is a little bit
like the handbrake on a car
and I've got that almost fully on.
The fish is basically just taking that line.
As I watch, at the moment,
it's just going out one inch,
two inches, three inches.
After half an hour,
my opponent stops for a breather.
And I do the same.
Then we're back for Round Two
and it's looking like a big fish.
Seven of us, on two boats,
are dragged half a mile - against the tide.
Right. It might surface!
It might surface over there.
Now I've got the fish on the ropes,
for the first time it feels like I'm driving the bus.
Under the boat. I don't want to be lifting it
while it's under the boat.
I think it's coming this way again.
It's just squashing my fingers!
It's gone this way.
See the water there? I haven't seen the fish yet.
It is near the surface. I've just seen the lead.
It's up in the water. I think we've got it.
Back of the net, and this one looks pretty big,
with an impressive 10-inch sting.
Head of the science team,
Dr Ning first secures the barb.
(Speaks Thai)
She's asked me to help her collect some venom
before we release the fish.
It takes six people to heave
this huge animal onto its front,
into a position where we can measure it.
180cm to the base of the tail.
Going for the wingspan.
1 .91 metres. Nearly two metres across. 1 .91 .
At around six feet across,
and roughly 400Ibs,
this female stingray
is by far the largest river fish I've ever seen.
Little did I realise she was about to produce
the mother of all surprises.
So we've just got the fish in
to where the scientific team is.
And, literally, as we sort of pulled it into the net,
it's actually given birth to two live young.
Dr Ning uses ultrasound
to see if there are any more babies still inside.
This is the first time scientists
have been able to collect data
from the fully-formed pups of these stingrays.
Here, here.
On the ultrasound, the dark line is the cavity
and there is a lighter shape inside it.
Apparently, that is the baby stingray still inside.
For me, this fish is a real first.
And not just for its size.
I thought I had one fish on the end.
It looks like I've got one, two, three,
and another one inside.
Four fish, one hook.
Like many sharks,
stingrays give birth to live young.
When they emerged,
these babies had what looked like
a small cap on their stings,
presumably to prevent internal injury
to the mother.
However, these safety catches soon drop off.
Within minutes, these twins are armed
and ready to defend themselves.
It has been known for these fish
to eject young when they are caught
and if they are not well developed,
there's a worry they won't survive.
The great thing about these two fish
is they are pretty well fully developed.
They might be being born a little bit early,
but I think they will survive in this river.
With that two-inch prong on their tails,
not a lot will come near them.
The scientists return to what I can
only describe as the mother ship.
No-one really knows
why this animal grows so huge.
Could size, I wonder,
be the key that allows a marine fish
to invade rivers?
Most sea fish die quickly in freshwater.
It's the larger ones that are best able to cope
with the stress and survive.
There's one final sample to extract.
OK.
- Be careful.
- we are now going to take the toxin.
OK. I’ll hold here.
Collecting this thick, toxic mucus
will help the scientists to discover,
in more detail, how the venom works.
It's time for me to bid farewell
to this river monster.
Though the jury's still out,
if further research confirms that this fish
does live exclusively in freshwater,
then it probably is the biggest
freshwater fish on the planet.
what's certain is that this is the biggest
and strangest catch of my life.
Reunited with her babies,
the mother stingray is set free
and she returns to the dark depths
of her hidden world.
I think she’ll probably go back
to all her friends
with stories of alien abduction.
''They did experiments on me'' and all sorts.
Personally, I feel like I'm the one
who has seen the alien.
I mean, just what an amazing,
totally un-fish-like fish.
I mean, a real monstrous beast.","The giant freshwater stingray (Urogymnus polylepis, also widely known by the junior synonym Himantura chaophraya) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. It is found in large rivers and estuaries in Southeast Asia and Borneo, though historically it may have been more widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia. The widest freshwater fish and the largest stingray in the world, this species grows up to 2.2 m (7.2 ft) across and can exceed 300 kg (660 lb) in weight. It has a relatively thin, oval pectoral fin disc that is widest anteriorly, and a sharply pointed snout with a protruding tip. Its tail is thin and whip-like, and lacks fin folds. This species is uniformly grayish brown above and white below; the underside of the pectoral and pelvic fins bear distinctive wide, dark bands on their posterior margins.
Bottom-dwelling in nature, the giant freshwater stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates. Females give live birth to litters of one to four pups, which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph (""uterine milk""). This species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat, recreation, and aquarium display, as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation. These forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central Thailand and Cambodia. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the giant freshwater stingray as Endangered.


== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The first scientific description of the giant freshwater stingray was authored by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in an 1852 volume of the journal Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen. His account was based on a juvenile specimen 30 cm (12 in) across, collected from Jakarta, Indonesia. Bleeker named the new species polylepis, from the Greek poly (""many"") and lepis (""scales""), and assigned it to the genus Trygon (now a synonym of Dasyatis). However, in subsequent years Bleeker's description was largely overlooked, and in 1990 the giant freshwater stingray was described again by Supap Monkolprasit and Tyson Roberts in an issue of the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology. They gave it the name Himantura chaophraya, which came into widespread usage. In 2008, Peter Last and B. Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto confirmed that T. polylepis and H. chaophraya refer to the same species, and since Bleeker's name was published earlier, the scientific name of the giant freshwater stingray became Himantura polylepis. This species may also be called the giant freshwater whipray, giant stingray, or freshwater whipray.
There is a complex of similar freshwater and estuarine stingrays in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that are or were tentatively identified with U. polylepis. The Australian freshwater Urogymnus  were described as a separate species, Urogymnus dalyensis, in 2008. The freshwater Urogymnus in New Guinea are probably U. dalyensis rather than U. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. Trygon fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with U. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of freshwater whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences. Finally, additional research is needed to assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of U. polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution, so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted.
In terms of the broader evolutionary relationships between the giant freshwater whipray and the rest of the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (U. granulatus) and the tubemouth whipray (U. lobistoma). This finding adds to a growing consensus that the genus Himantura sensu lato is paraphyletic.


== Description ==

The giant freshwater stingray has a thin, oval pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front. The elongated snout has a wide base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc. The eyes are minute and widely spaced; behind them are large spiracles. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae (two to four large at the center and one to four small to the sides) on the floor. The small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands. There are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc. The pelvic fins are small and thin; mature males have relatively large claspers.
The thin, cylindrical tail measures 1.8–2.5 times as long as the disc and lacks fin folds. A single serrated stinging spine is positioned on the upper surface of the tail near the base. At up to 38 cm (15 in) long, the spine is the largest of any stingray species. There is band of heart-shaped tubercles on the upper surface of the disc extending from before the eyes to the base of the sting; there is also a midline row of four to six enlarged tubercles at the center of the disc. The remainder of the disc upper surface is covered by tiny granular denticles, and the tail is covered with sharp prickles past the sting. This species is plain grayish brown above, often with a yellowish or pinkish tint towards the fin margins; in life the skin is coated with a layer of dark brown mucus. The underside is white with broad dark bands, edged with small spots, on the trailing margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins. The tail is black behind the spine. The giant freshwater stingray reaches at least 1.9 m (6.2 ft) in width and 5.0 m (16.4 ft) in length, and can likely grow larger (It is not impossible that length is even 10 m (33 ft), and width is
5 m (16 ft)).  With reports from the Mekong and Chao Phraya Rivers of individuals weighing 500–600 kg (1,100–1,300 lb), but it is not impossible, that it is 1,500 kg (3,300 lb), or even 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) - it ranks among the largest freshwater fishes in the world.
In June 2022, it was reported that a specimen caught in the Mekong river had broken the record for the largest strict freshwater fish ever documented (the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size, but they are anadromous). The individual weighed 661 lb (300 kg), and was measured at 3.98 m (13.1 ft) long and 2.2 m (7.2 ft) wide.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The giant freshwater stingray is known to inhabit several large rivers and associated estuaries in Indochina and Borneo. In Indochina, it occurs in the Mekong River to potentially as far upstream as Chiang Khong in Thailand, as well as in the Chao Phraya, Nan, Mae Klong, Bang Pakong, and Tapi Rivers, also found in Bueng Boraphet but now completely extinct. In Borneo, this species is found in the Mahakam River in Kalimantan and the Kinabatangan and Buket Rivers in Sabah; it is reportedly common in the Kinabatangan River but infrequently caught. Though it has been reported from Sarawak as well, surveys within the past 25 years have not found it there. Elsewhere in the region, recent river surveys in Java have not recorded its presence, despite the island being the locality of the species holotype.
Historical records from the Ganges River in India, and the Bay of Bengal as Trygon fluviatilis are possibly Himantura fluviatilis, although it has been confirmed as being present in the Kaladan and Mayu rivers in Myanmar in 2022.
Disjunct populations of the giant freshwater stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, there is no evidence that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas.


== Biology and ecology ==
The diet of the giant freshwater stingray consists of small, benthic fishes and invertebrates such as crustaceans and molluscs, which it can detect using its electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini. Individuals can often be seen at the edge of the river, possibly feeding on earthworms. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium asnihae, A. etini, A. masnihae, A. saliki, A. zainali, Rhinebothrium abaiensis, R. kinabatanganensis, and R. megacanthophallus. The giant freshwater stingray is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished initially by yolk and later by histotroph (""uterine milk"") provided by the mother. This species does not appear to be diadromous (migrating between fresh and salt water to complete its life cycle). Observed litter sizes range from one to four pups; newborns measure around 30 cm (12 in) across. Pregnant females are frequently found in estuaries, which may serve as nursery areas. Males mature sexually at approximately 1.1 m (3.6 ft) across; female maturation size and other life history details are unknown.

The giant freshwater stingray is not aggressive, but its sting is sheathed in toxic mucus and is capable of piercing bone. Across its range, this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines, and to a lesser extent gillnets and fish traps. It is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch; a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud, becoming almost impossible to lift, or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater. The meat and the cartilage are used; large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale. Adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless. In the Mae Klong and Bang Pakong Rivers, the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums. These trends pose conservation concerns; the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown, the latter because this species does not survive well in captivity.
The major threats to the giant freshwater stingray are overfishing and habitat degradation resulting from deforestation, land development, and damming. The construction of dams also fragments the population, reducing genetic diversity and increasing the susceptibility of the resulting subpopulations to extinction. Due to its low reproductive rate, the giant freshwater stingray is not resilient to anthropogenic pressures. In central Thailand and Cambodia, the population is estimated to have been reduced by 30–50% over the past 20–30 years, with declines as severe as 95% in some locations. The size of rays caught has decreased significantly as well; for example, in Cambodia the average weight of a landed ray has dropped from 23.2 kg (51 lb) in 1980 to 6.9 kg (15 lb) in 2006. The status of populations in other areas, such as Borneo, is largely unknown. As a result of documented declines, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Endangered overall, and as Critically Endangered in Thailand. In the 1990s, the Thai government initiated a captive breeding program at Chai Nat to bolster the population of this and other freshwater stingray species until the issue of habitat degradation can be remedied. However, by 1996 the program had been put on hold.

Killer Snakehead,Northern Snakehead,Channa argus,"My name's Jeremy Wade.
I'm a biologist with a passion
for dangerous fish.
The big, the bad and the ugly.
what a monster this thing is!
Now I'm after a predator
that's invading America.
watch your pets. watch your children.
It has spawned horror movies,
and stands accused of homicide.
These fish have reportedly attacked humans.
Allegedly, it can even breathe air
and crawl on land.
But how much of this can I actually believe?
I intend to separate fact from fiction,
and to find out first hand
if this beast really does attack people.
Does its bite...match the hype?
And could these so-called
Franken-fish take over?
I've been investigating dangerous
freshwater fish for over 20 years.
But I've never come across an animal
quite like this before.
According to this website, they hunt in packs.
It says here that they have a poisonous bite.
Cannibalistic.
Eats everything in its path.
Breathes air and walks on land.
Some of these reports make it sound
like some kind of primeval throwback.
A creature from before the dinosaurs,
when fish were first starting
to crawl out of the swamps.
There's a story here from Malaysia of a man,
apparently, who was castrated.
And another story here from Thailand.
Apparently somebody killed.
To find out if these horrific reports are true,
I’ll be heading to Southeast Asia.
As well as finding eyewitnesses, I want to track
down the monster that stands accused.
The snakehead is a fish
born with a taste for flesh.
A beauty that turns into a beast.
This seems like a fish
that punches well above its weight.
If just half of what I'm reading is true,
then the snakehead really is
a beast to be reckoned with.
I want to meet this fish in the flesh
and find out what it is truly capable of.
Can they really breathe air
and crawl across land?
Is it true that they are spreading like a virus,
devouring everything in their path?
And are they really aggressive enough
to attack and kill a human?
My search for this alleged killer
begins in a place where it doesn't belong.
I'm in south Florida,
pursuing an animal that's travelled
halfway round the world,
and is now busy invading new
territory far from its natural home.
When Bob Newland pulled a weird-looking
creature from a Miami backwater in 2000,
he took it to Florida's Exotic Fish lab,
to find out what it was.
When I got it there, I just dropped it right on
the floor and I said, ''OK, Paul, what is this?''
And he just looked at me and said,
''I don't know.''
And then he got a big book
and looked in the book and then he said,
''This is what it is. It's a snakehead.''
He wanted to know where I caught it.
I said, ''On a golf course in Tamarac.''
He said, ''No, I need to know
what hole you found it on.''
Government scientist Paul Shafland
had to act fast.
what we had hoped was
that they would only be in one pond.
And if they were in one pond,
we could go in and eradicate.
But when his team checked
the surrounding canals, it was bad news.
Snakehead. 583.
The invaders were already on the move.
South Florida is a maze of
interconnected canals.
We couldn't have created
a more ideal habitat for snakeheads.
Shafland is up against the Bullseye Snakehead.
But this is just one member
of a much larger gang.
Snakeheads are, in fact, a group
of almost 30 different species
that range in size from a small flick knife
to a four-foot torpedo.
They're ambush predators,
with long, camouflaged bodies,
ripping teeth,
and a reputation for extreme aggression.
Their global empire already stretches
from tropical Africa to the Far East,
including Russia.
And they seem to be spreading.
Soon after Newlands’ discovery,
a second species surfaced in Maryland,
just 20 miles from Washington, DC.
The Northern Snakehead is built
to survive cold Siberian winters.
And its presence set off alarm bells
in the government and the media.
These fish are top-level predators
that will eat anything in their path.
They can travel across land and live
out of water for three days.
Snakeheads reportedly
even attacked humans...
(Echoing) ..attacked humans.
- Argh!
- Dad!
This just sort of took off
and exploded with the media.
People said, ''Do we have to worry about our
children being attacked on the way to school?
Can we leave our pets in the yard
or will the snakeheads eat them?''
Meanwhile, scientists from the
Fish and wildlife Department
feared that these snakeheads
could unleash ecological havoc.
And in a bid to wipe them out,
they poisoned an entire pond,
killing every last fish.
Yet despite efforts to exterminate them,
Northern Snakeheads are now
established in five states across the eastern US.
Media hype is one thing.
But when a government is spending
millions of dollars to fight a fish,
you know you've got a serious problem.
I never expected that I'd be fishing
in a quiet residential area
for fish that have been branded
''worse than piranhas''.
I'm in south Florida,
just a few miles from where snakeheads
first showed up.
To catch one of these alien invaders,
I'm using a lure that imitates live prey.
Most baits and lures,
you've got the hook exposed.
But here, if a fish grabs it,
that's what happens.
I hook up with local guide Alan Zaremba,
an experienced snakehead angler.
Very nice.
Look at that. Oh!
Oh...
First cast and...
The frog had a huge...
a huge lump of salad with it, as well,
and the fish went for meat and veg,
but didn't hook up.
- Ah. That was a hit and a miss.
- Another snakehead.
The problem with the snakeheads
is you get one shot at 'em.
They don't come back for a second shot.
What do they eat? It's not just fish.
Anything that's moving that they can ambush.
The adults, at least,
appear to be Ione hunters.
They're not swarming in packs like piranhas.
But as I work the banks,
it's clear that these canals
are crawling with snakeheads.
Oh, yes!
- That was a hit.
- That was a hit.
Take a long cast up that way.
Maybe he's got some amigos here.
Great shot.
Are these fish are still part
of the first wave, I wonder?
Or has an invasion
already become an occupation?
They're here and you're not gonna stop 'em.
You're not gonna stop these fish.
They seem to love these shallow
areas, especially if you get some weeds.
- Did you see that?
- Let it drop.
Set the hook.
That is a fish on. That one came out
right from the side, didn't it?
That came out four or five feet,
its wake just arrowing out.
I've hooked my first snakehead.
And what it lacks in size,
it more than makes up for with attitude.
Here we go. That's it.
A Bullseye Snakehead.
Now I've got my hands on one of these
things, I can see why it's called a snakehead.
A very long, thin, muscular fish.
I think very often,
fish which are long and quite snakelike
do give quite a strong fight.
This particular one is called a Bullseye
Snakehead because of this eyespot on the tail.
Have a look inside the mouth. There we go.
That's definitely the mouth of a predator.
ALL those teeth there.
And it's not just smaller fish that it eats.
It eats frogs, I was using an imitation frog.
Also things like lizards, rats, even small ducks.
These fish are clearly carnivorous.
But do they deserve their reputation
for extreme aggression?
It's very easy to go on the internet, and in a
matter of a few minutes, you find stuff like this.
These are clips put up by people
who keep pet snakeheads.
This is what happens
when they feed them live fish.
Just like pet snakes, these predatory
fish prefer their food alive.
when they strike, it just happens too fast to see.
It's certainly too fast for the small
fish to take any avoiding action.
People always talk about predators
being aggressive.
Most predators kill for a reason.
They need food.
But these fish just seem to kill as a reflex - bite
something in half and then just leave it to die.
I'm used to fishing for predators, but seeing the
moment of the strike close up is gruesome.
They really do seem to be natural born killers.
These pet snakeheads are mere minnows.
Just imagine what a 40-pounder
could do to a child or a dog.
Looking at these clips really begs the question,
Who set these violent offenders
loose in America, and why?
Lieutenant Pat Reynolds keeps a close eye
on the illegal wildlife trade in south Florida,
and was called in to investigate.
I think they're getting a delivery
of salt water products here.
The guy has a game fish
in the back of his truck,
and you cannot sell it.
When this fish was first found in the waterways
here, what was your involvement?
I was alerted by our fishery biologists.
They suspected very strongly
that these were released...
particularly in the um...
Oriental trade, or the Asian trade.
Quite frankly, the first store I went into had 'em.
And we tracked them back to New York City.
They were coming in through New York,
brought down here, by an Oriental wholesaler
who was distributing them to the market.
I inspected the airport in Miami
and yes, they did come in.
we made arrests and we seized the fish.
Possessing a live snakehead
can now land you in jail.
But you're allowed to catch and even
sell these fish if you put them on ice.
Snakeheads are highly prized by many
Asian-Americans, not just since they taste good.
How much do they go for?
Oh, 15 or 20 each?
...when we sell it.
Helps the healing process.
Yes. Yeah.
We believe
they were intentionally released
with the idea that they could...
that an entrepreneur or businessman
was gonna go catch 'em
and sell 'em into this trade.
Not keeping one in a tank and it's too big,
or they get bored and put it in the water?
No. Somebody intentionally put 'em
out there so they could harvest 'em later.
And they wouldn't have to import it
from New York.
Here's what we tell everybody.
If you catch 'em, cos they are good
eating, don't throw it back.
Put it on ice, take it home and eat it.
Lieutenant Reynolds never did catch
the entrepreneur
who dropped the Bullseye Snakehead
into Florida.
And since it first turned up in 2000,
the invader has continued to spread inland.
I'm now at the very edge of the canal network,
where it borders on
the Everglades National Park.
Could snakeheads have come this far?
You landed right on top of something there.
I hit it. That was a peacock, wasn't it?
If this was a snakehead, that would be it,
but this is a Peacock Bass. Territorial.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
The Peacock Bass
is also a non-native predator.
But it was brought in officially,
as a biological control,
to eat invasive species like Tilapia.
Its intolerance to cold water
prevents it from spreading.
This is another fish
that is a long way away from home.
This is a native of the Amazon -
the Peacock Bass.
They call it a Butterfly Peacock Bass.
It's a smaller variety of those.
Definitely a predator.
Big mouth,
but not as toothy as the snakehead.
But very capacious mouth there.
And one thing that's interesting about this -
it's also got an eyespot.
That's why they call this the Peacock Bass.
So, it's similar, in that respect,
to the snakehead.
But one noticeable difference
between this and the snakehead
is the body shape.
This one is flattened...that way, laterally.
If this was to fall on the ground,
it would flop around in the same position.
The snakehead is flattened that way.
If that falls on the ground and fIaps around,
it's actually going to move.
The snakehead can wriggle its way
overland and find a new home.
That's why they worry about them here.
Soon after they arrived here, snakeheads
caught the imagination of filmmakers.
The alien invaders were cast
as slithering assassins...
..as super fish, that could somehow
crawl out of the water and attack dogs,
or unsuspecting humans.
It's easy to dismiss
this movie monster as pure fantasy,
and yet, remarkably,
much of it is based on fact.
Some of the traits that the media
picked up on are true.
The fish can survive out of water.
Some of them can move overland.
They do have high levels of aggression.
Does this mean that snakeheads could,
under certain conditions,
become the backyard predators
of our nightmares?
(Screaming)
Fish biologist Ray Waldner
has studied snakeheads in detail.
It is an air breather.
It can use atmospheric oxygen.
You’ll see the fish come up to the surface,
lift its head up a little bit,
grab a mouthful of air
and then submerge again.
Snakeheads have a special chamber
above the gills that acts as a simple lung.
when it gulps air, oxygen diffuses
into an encircling mesh of blood vessels.
If they're in a very stagnant area,
where the oxygen levels in the water
are very, very low,
the fish is still able to survive.
So, they can survive under conditions
that would definitely kill other fishes.
But it also allows the fish to live out of the water.
So far, so Hollywood.
But are snakeheads mobile enough
to threaten anyone on land?
A few years ago, Paul Shafland
brought some back to his lab,
and put them to the test.
He's moving, OK?
But he's not making a real
directional movement.
Most of the time, they sat like this,
with a little bit of flipping.
But the snakehead has just soft pectorals.
It doesn't have a way to support itself.
They seem to burn out pretty quick.
Experts agree that some snakeheads
do travel across land.
In areas with seasonal flooding,
it enables them to spread
into new lakes and rivers.
The patio-prowling monster, however,
looks suspiciously like a myth.
In their element,
I've seen that snakeheads hit fast and hit hard.
They are very aggressive.
Anything that comes close, they will tear into.
Leaving aside any possible threat to people,
I'm starting to wonder what happens
to other animals
when the fish equivalent of
Special Forces suddenly turns up.
I don't think there's much around
that they probably wouldn't go after.
Undoubtedly, snakeheads are feeding on
these native fishes such as Bass and Sunfish.
The Crappies that we have here,
the Golden Shiners,
all of those are fair game,
and there are numerous others, as well.
If there's anything that's a little bit different
about the Bullseye Snakehead's feeding habits,
it's the breadth of foods that it will take.
If something is close enough to it,
and it can get it in its mouth, it’ll eat it.
This is a stomach
from a Bullseye Snakehead,
this is a Tilapia.
They’ll also eat native fish.
There's two Mosquitofish in there.
This is a Crayfish that was in a stomach.
This is the Marine Toad.
They've even had a snake.
And as you can see,
the whole snake was eaten.
This is actually
a cannibalistic snakehead.
This is a juvenile snakehead.
There have even been some turtles.
The breadth is very interesting.
Snakeheads are starting to sound
like eco-monsters,
invaders with the power to mow down
everything in their path.
we've got a fish that could be
potentially devastating.
The danger is to the native fishes,
native aquatic species.
That's where the problem lies.
Snakeheads, it seems, hold all the aces.
Not only can they thrive in stagnant water,
but females are able to produce
100,000 young per year.
And it gets worse.
My main concern comes because
snakeheads show very extreme parental care.
They vehemently,
aggressively guard their spawn,
and will voraciously attack anything that comes
close to them, anything that poses a threat.
With such fertile and protective parents,
snakeheads have the potential
to multiply rapidly.
what's more, few native predators
are willing to take on an adult snakehead,
so there's little to keep them in check.
But it wasn't always like this.
80 years ago, the US had a home-grown
monster that outgunned any snakehead.
The monstrous AIIigator Gar
can grow up to ten feet long
and weight in at over 300Ib.
Its jaws bristle with rows
of dagger-like teeth,
and it is protected by
a prehistoric-looking armoured coat.
But accused of savage attacks on humans,
this super predator has been wiped
out across most of its natural range,
leaving a continent-wide
ecological vacuum,
virgin hunting grounds
for an opportunistic hunter like a snakehead.
Nothing more than an earth bank now stands
between Florida's snakehead infestation
and the Everglades National Park,
a vital refuge for endangered wildlife.
Despite its Jack the Ripper reputation,
the Bullseye Snakehead is, in one sense,
just another addition to Florida's
existing roll call of exotic wildlife.
Every year, some 200 million live
animals are brought into the US,
to supply a pet trade worth billions of dollars.
In Florida, many of these foreign imports have
escaped and become permanent residents.
To get an idea of how many exotic
fish there are here,
and to put the snakehead invasion
into some kind of context,
I join a Fish and wildlife team on the canals.
Bursts of electricity from the boat's electrodes
leave any nearby fish temporarily stunned,
allowing us to scoop them out and drop them
into a holding tank for later inspection.
That's a Florida gar.
First one I've seen out of the water.
Native species like this will be
returned to the water.
But any non-natives, like snakeheads,
will be put on ice and killed.
I'm amazed to discover such a rich
mix of native and exotic species
living cheek by jowl in a single small canal.
After an hour, we pull over to examine our catch.
BIuegill.
202.
what's that? That's 140.
OK, this is a BIuegill. That's a native species,
so that goes...back in the water.
This is a bit like a fairground lucky dip.
Spider tilapia, 129.
60 grams.
That's an exotic, so, this one,
not such good news. This one goes in the box.
Peacock. That's a Peacock Bass.
362. Peacock.
And that is...
750 grams.
And this is a Peacock Bass.
Although this is from South America,
from the Amazon,
this was one introduced officially,
this one has got a visa.
This is not an illegal immigrant.
This one can go in the water.
Bullseye Snakehead.
691 .
OK. So, that is...215.
Unfortunately for this one, it's in the box.
So, it really is a melting pot.
I've seen fish from Africa,
Southeast Asia, Central America...
They're all here in North America.
Florida currently has 32 kinds
of resident exotic fish.
And out of these, snakeheads
are said to be the best eating.
Local angler Martin Arostegui
has offered to cook one up.
Well, guys, here's the snakehead.
- Wonderful.
- ALL ready.
Moment of truth. I've heard this is very good.
It smells very good.
- Put a little sauce on it.
- A bit of both?
Either one.
OK. Nice and white.
That's very nice.
It's really nice.
I'm glad you liked it.
Though I can't swear to the
snakehead's medicinal powers,
I can confirm that this fish is excellent eating.
with such large and tasty fillets,
it's a wonder there aren't more people
catching them for dinner.
As well as providing good sport, this would also
help keep these unwanted predators in check.
Just how far these intruders
will spread is hard to predict.
But America already has another alien invader
that could perhaps show me where
the snakehead story is heading.
My destination is the Illinois River.
Skipper and research scientist
Greg Sass isn't taking any chances.
What's the idea behind the net?
This gives a little defence for the driver,
trying to protect himself.
And what happened there?
Occasionally, we get such large ones
that come up into the net with such force
that they blow a hole right through it.
40 years ago, catfish farmers in the south
imported a fish from China,
to clean up waste from the breeding ponds.
Before long, some escaped into the wild,
and began spreading north through
the Mississippi river system.
Like snakeheads today,
they weren't an obvious problem at first.
Then, almost overnight, they became a plague.
Just absolutely full of fish down here.
Nice flat, calm surface.
But there's loads of them down there.
Quite a fish soup, in fact.
It's not until Greg accelerates, though,
that the show begins.
These are siIver carp.
And at up to 40 pounds, they're
a serious danger to anyone in an open boat.
Quite literally, they've smashed people's ribs
and knocked people overboard.
Oh! BIimey. Seeing these as dots
on the sonar is one thing,
but the noise of our motor provokes
this mass escape response.
There's up to 13 tons of these fish
for every mile in the river.
And that hundreds of miles. They go all
the way down to the mouth of the Mississippi.
Just ten years ago,
the carp were virtually unknown here.
Now they've all but taken over.
Agh!
Absoiutely stiff with fish.
Look at this. There's more siIver
than green in the water there.
I actually feel the boat being
buffeted as they bang into it.
Oops.
So, who needs a rod when these things
just jump into the boat?
The real key to the success of this fish...
is in here.
There's the red of the gill filaments,
and then in front of that, that is basically a filter,
and nothing really gets through that.
That filters down to objects
the size of four microns.
That's a speck of dust.
It's a bit like us feeding every
time we breathe, basically.
That's why they're putting on weight.
By removing everything from the water,
they leave nothing for the native species,
like Buffalo, also filter feeders,
but not as good at it as these chaps.
So, the native species
are gradually losing weight,
and if they get too thin,
they're not able to breed,
and that's why these things are taking over.
As they put the squeeze on native fishes,
the carp are also knocking out
an entire fishing industry.
If a filter feeder can cause such damage,
then what about a hardcore predator?
Are snakeheads, like these siIver carp,
also destined to explode out of control?
My guess is we're going to see
some real problems arise
in the next several years from snakeheads,
both competing with and preying upon
our native fishes.
The fish have the potential
to absolutely take over.
Between them, the Bullseye
and Northern Snakeheads
have what it takes to overrun
most of North America.
If they do, then fisheries worth
over $30 billion to the economy
could take a massive hit.
And it doesn't end here.
A third, much larger member of the gang,
has been turning up sporadically
from Maine down to Arkansas.
The Giant Snakehead is a beast
that can weigh as much as a five-year-old child.
And it comes with a nasty reputation.
I've heard stories of the Giant
Snakehead attacking humans,
and even a case of one individual
being killed by a Giant Snakehead.
To track down this would-be invader,
and find out if it really is
as dangerous as people say,
I must travel to the far side of the world.
I'm in Thailand,
and I waste no time heading upcountry.
My destination is a place called Khao Laem,
a remote dam on the upper reaches
of the River Kwai,
close to the Burmese border.
This is prime snakehead habitat,
and I've come here
in the middle of the monsoon,
just when the fish are at their most aggressive.
It's their breeding season,
and they're said to attack anything
that comes close to their fry, including people.
Yet the Giant Snakehead
is also a popular food fish.
Many people here farm them to sell.
Snakehead really do lend themselves
to this type of business, this type of culture.
They are really tolerant to low
oxygen levels in the water.
You can see they're coming up to the air,
blowing out spent air and taking another gulp.
And also they look very pretty
when they're small.
You can absolutely understand why people
would want those in their aquarium in Florida.
Even in these cramped conditions,
the Giant Snakehead fry are thriving.
By one month, they've doubled in size,
and are growing ever more hungry...for flesh.
Breakfast is pulped fish.
But this ravenous swarm
has never been hand-fed.
So, it's going to be a test of nerve for them,
as well as for me.
I've watched snakeheads not much bigger
than these rip into finger-sized fish.
There's one or two pecking.
Agh.
Right up to late juvenile stage,
these snakeheads school and feed together.
The stories I've read of voracious packs
are starting to make sense.
I've come to Thailand to find out if
the Giant Snakehead really does attack people.
ALL the reports of snakehead attacks
on humans concern just one species -
the Giant Snakehead.
Like many here, Sombat lives by the water
and often encounters these aggressive fish.
what happened was that he needed
to swim underneath his raft
to replace some of the bamboo,
it gets a bit rotten.
It's as he's fixing his raft
that Sombat senses something behind him.
With nowhere to hide,
he's face to face with a Giant Snakehead.
It put its fins out,
a bit like an elephant threatening to charge.
Before Sombat can move,
the fish has savaged his foot.
It was bleeding so bad
that he went to the hospital.
They didn't believe a fish was responsible.
They thought it was a dog
and ended up giving him rabies jabs.
So, what we've got here
is a very dramatic example
of what appears to be
a completely unprovoked attack.
Sombat's story proves to me
that a Giant Snakehead
will attack something far bigger than itself.
It seems to be a fish that really
does punch well above its weight.
Like its cousin the Bullseye,
the Giant Snakehead is an ambush predator,
that favours areas with plenty of cover.
For several hours, I work the banks
and shallow bays of the dam,
without getting so much as a nibble.
Fishing for snakeheads here
is a world away from Florida,
where the hits came thick and fast.
With Sombat's story still fresh in my mind,
I send a lure towards an abandoned raft.
Oh, yes!
whee! A Giant Snakehead.
whoo.
This fish is only one-tenth the size
of a full-grown adult.
But it's certainly got some attitude.
Very toothy. I wonder if I can just
get my hand in there.
Its snakelike appearance
has led to the belief, in some places,
that this fish has a poisonous bite.
Fortunately, this simply isn't true.
That is...yeah, that is a bit of a toothy critter.
Although it's got a fierce reputation,
quite a beautiful fish, really.
I've hand-fed the carnivorous fry,
and been snapped at by a bolshie juvenile.
But everyone here tells me
that if I want to catch the daddy,
then I must first pay a visit
to the man who knows how.
To find this snakehead guru,
I travel deeper into Khao Laem's
muddy backwaters.
Khun Da is the master hunter.
Over the past 20 years, he's gained
an unrivalled knowledge of his quarry.
Forget nets or rods.
For Da, catching a Giant Snakehead
is more like armed combat.
And his weapon of choice is the spear gun.
The problem with this spear gun is
that it takes a long time to reload.
So, Khun Da's actually invented
his own rapid reload spear,
which is much simpler,
but much more effective.
The key feature of Da's home-made
gun is that he can re-arm it quickly.
As he explains, this is crucial
when you're hunting a fish that defends in pairs.
(Speaks Thai)
Unusually for a fish, snakeheads
fiercely guard their young.
But Da's own close-quarter observations
add a further twist to the story.
While the father corrals the cluster of fry,
the mother patrols at a distance,
primed to attack anything that looks
like a threat to her offspring.
What's interesting is that this
is coming from somebody
who is observing these creatures
closer than any scientist,
and the reason is that not only his livelihood,
but possibly his life, depends on it.
Da knows that if he shoots
one snakehead,
he still has to watch his back.
Stories of people being mauled by snakeheads
are not uncommon around here.
But now I picked up a more disturbing lead.
I crossed to the far side of Khao Laem Dam,
just 12 miles from Burma.
People sometimes slip across
the border to fish here for a day or two,
then melt back into the jungle with their catch.
I'm used to tall tales, but the story
I'm about to hear is so freakish
that no-one could possibly have made it up.
Thai fishermen Khun Lang vividly
recalls the Burmese couple
that came here three years ago
to hunt snakeheads.
(Speaks Thai)
So, what actually happened was that the
fisherman was underwater with his spear gun,
shot the snakehead head-on,
and actually scored a direct hit.
The fish then just kept on coming,
and shoved the rear end of the metal spear
through the fisherman's mask and into his face.
The fish was just panicking so much
it was thrashing.
The fish doesn't have a reverse gear.
It just kept fIapping.
Apparently, the spear actually came
out the back of the man's head.
The wife was still sitting in the boat, dived down
into the water, and found the fisherman dead.
I actually came here doubting these stories,
doubting this fish has been
responsible for any fatalities,
and here we have a very graphic case
of a snakehead causing a human fatality.
I've deliberately timed my trip here to coincide
with the Giant Snakehead's breeding season.
This is when the fish
are at their most aggressive,
as they guard their young against all comers.
A fleeting ripple shows me where
the fry have just surfaced to gulp air.
By dropping my lure right on top of them,
I'm trying to provoke a strike
from one of the parents.
But it seems that these canny adults
know all about fishing lures.
The only snakehead that has a go
is a ten-inch juvenile.
Small snakehead.
With the rain beating down,
it soon becomes impossible
to spot the fry as they surface,
let alone get the attention of the parents.
I'm trying to create a disturbance
on the surface to wind the fish up.
When the water is calm, you've got no
competition. It's the only thing making a noise.
When you've got rain falling on the water,
the signal's very confused.
You've got to land that bait much closer
to the fish to get them to notice it.
The weather isn't about to let up.
But worse than this,
and for reasons that aren't made clear,
I've just been told that I'm not
allowed to fish here any more.
So, if I'm ever going to get
face to face with this monster,
I'm going to have to pack away
my rods and do it another way.
I return to Khun Da, the master hunter.
My plan is to dive with him,
as he goes after the Giant Snakehead
with nothing more than a pair of old
goggles and the home-made spear gun.
In these choppy conditions,
I'm straining to spot the surfacing fry.
Yet Khun Da's predatory eye
picks out the slight ripple that gives them away.
Ready? I follow?
And with our target pinpointed,
the hunt can begin.
I'm getting a bit nervous.
It is totally another world down there.
By diving with a small camera,
I hope to capture the entire drama as it unfolds.
Everything has to happen on a single breath.
So, before going under,
we edge as close as we can to our target.
But when Da suddenly slips in
and vanishes without trace,
he leaves me scrambling to catch up.
Bad weather has churned the water
into a murky soup.
And with Da gone, I feel a stab of panic.
I could easily wind up
getting harpooned by mistake.
The poor visibility is even hampering Da.
It's murky down there. It's murky.
I'm having second thoughts about this.
I'm starting to feel like human bait.
But it's too late to pull out now.
Da is a man on a mission.
When the fry break the surface,
barely a boat-length away, we Iaunch again.
But our quarry has vanished into the murk,
leaving Da to hunt on instinct.
Da loads. I can sense we're close.
Suddenly we're in the heart of the swarm.
I think we've got one.
I'm going to keep out of the way.
With a single well-aimed shot,
Da has caught a Giant Snakehead.
Sitting in a boat, dangling a line over the edge,
believe me, is easy in comparison.
Despite taking a direct hit,
the fish simply seems to shrug it off.
Doesn't like that.
Having listened to accounts
of its aggressive behaviour,
and seen for myself the scars on Sombat's foot,
I'm well aware of what this river monster
is capable of.
So, there we go.
That wonderful black and white
colouration.
That is very much something that the fry will
identify with. Bright colour. It's calling to them.
I expected this fish to end up as dinner.
Yet in a strange twist of fate,
it's almost unharmed.
Da's spear has pierced the muscle of its back,
but missed its vital organs.
we're releasing this fish.
This is catch-and-release spear fishing.
This is going to go back
and it is going to recover.
I'm just hoping it doesn't double back
and have a go at me as a last farewell.
She is actually free now.
She can go if she wants.
There she goes.
It's actually gone back into the lake,
to be reunited with the young.
Really good to see. You don't expect
to see that from a fish caught on a spear.
Of all the encounters I've had with dangerous
fish, this had to be one of the most unnerving.
Down in that murky water,
I could hardly see anything.
I didn't know if I was going to be
attacked by the fish
or maybe end up myself on the end of the spear.
But over the course of my journey, a clearer
picture of the snakehead has emerged.
The two species that have reached America
pose no direct threat to humans,
although, in the eyes of many,
their presence is an unfolding
environmental disaster.
But in Southeast Asia, I have found a fish
that does deserve to be called a monster.
The word made flesh.
This animal is already knocking
on America's door.
If the Giant Snakehead ever gains
a foothold in America,
then you really would have to think twice
about getting in the water.","The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a species of snakehead fish native to temperate East Asia, in China, Russia, North Korea, and South Korea. Their natural range goes from the Amur River watershed in Siberia and Manchuria down to Hainan. It is an important food fish and one of the most cultivated in its native region, with an estimated 500 short tons (450 t) produced every year in China and Korea alone. Due to this, the northern snakehead has been exported throughout the world and has managed to establish non-native populations in Central Asia and North America. In the United States, it is found in Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Arkansas, Missouri, and Mississippi.


== Appearance ==

The distinguishing features of a northern snakehead include a long dorsal fin with 49–50 rays, an anal fin with 31–32 rays, a small, anteriorly depressed head, the eyes above the middle part of the upper jaw, a large mouth extending well beyond the eye, and villiform teeth in bands, with large canines on the lower jaw and palatines. It is generally reported to reach a length up to 100 cm (3 ft 3 in), but specimens approaching 150 cm (4 ft 11 in) are known according to Russian ichthyologists. The largest registered by the International Game Fish Association weighs 9.53 kg (21 lb 0 oz).
Its coloration is a golden tan to pale brown, with dark blotches on the sides and saddle-like blotches across the back. Blotches toward the front tend to separate between top and bottom sections, while rear blotches are more likely to be contiguous. Coloration is nearly the same between juveniles and adults, which is unusual among snakeheads, and is similar to Channa maculata, but can be distinguished by two bar-like marks on the caudal peduncle (where the tail attaches); in C. maculata, the rear bar is usually complete, with pale bar-like areas before and after, while in C. argus, the rear bar is irregular and blotched, with no pale areas around it.


=== Fish similar in appearance ===
The eyespot bowfin (Amia ocellicauda) and northern snakehead can be found in the same waters on the swampy tidal coastal plain of the mid-Atlantic United States, such as the Potomac and Delaware River, and are commonly confused with each other. Some contrasting differences in northern snakehead include the lack of a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle, a golden tan to brown coloration with dark splotches, a longer anal fin, a more elongated head, and an upper jaw that is shorter than its lower jaw. Another noticeable difference is that the northern snakehead has scales that continue uniformly from the body through to their head, whereas bowfin heads are smooth and free of scales.


== Behavior ==
The northern snakehead is a freshwater species and cannot tolerate salinity in excess of 10 parts per million. It is a facultative air breather; it uses a suprabranchial organ and a bifurcated ventral aorta that permit aquatic and aerial respiration.  This unusual respiratory system allows it to live outside of water for several days; it can wriggle its way to other bodies of water or survive being transported by humans. Only young of this species (not adults) may be able to move overland for short distances using wriggling motions. The preferred habitats of this species are stagnant water with mud substrate and aquatic vegetation, or slow, murky, swampy streams; it is primarily piscivorous, but is known to eat crustaceans, other invertebrates, and amphibians.


== Reproduction ==

The northern snakehead can double its population in as little as 15 years. It reaches sexual maturity at age three or four, when it will be about 30 to 35 cm (1 ft 0 in – 1 ft 2 in) long. The eggs are fertilized externally; a female can lay 100,000 eggs a year. Fertilization occurs in shallow water in the early morning. The eggs are yellow and spherical, about 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter. Eggs hatch after about 1–2 days, but they can take much longer at lower temperatures. The eggs are guarded by the parents until egg absorption, when the eggs are about 8 mm (0.31 in) long.


== Subspecies ==
Two subspecies have been recognized:

C. a. argus (Cantor, 1842) (Northern snakehead) China and Korea
C. a. warpachowskii Berg, 1909 (Amur snakehead) eastern Russia.


== As an invasive species ==
In its native Asia, the snakehead fish is considered to be an important food fish and for this reason they have been exported to many other regions around the world. They were first introduced to Japan from mainland Asia in the early 1900s, where they have since become a sport fish. The USSR experimented with aquaculture of snakeheads during the mid 20th century in both Europe and Central Asia. In the United States, snakeheads were only cultured in Arkansas, but have managed to establish populations there and several states in the Mid-Atlantic.


=== Japan ===
Snakeheads of Korean stock were first introduced to Japan in the 1920s, and since then have spread to about every suitable body of water on the Japanese mainland.


=== Europe ===
During the Cold War, the USSR imported several different species of fish from eastern Eurasia into Europe for new prospects in aquaculture. Among these fish was the northern snakehead, which came from the Amur River basin and were stocked in various ponds of the Moscow region starting in 1949. These initial experiments were successful and it was recommended that snakehead be stocked into various other waterbodies. However, only one shipment to Czechoslovakia was ever made in 1955, and nothing else after. The snakehead was also introduced to the Volga Delta and various ponds in Yekaterinburg, but are presumed to have failed due to no reports since then.
While the snakeheads were reported to have been breeding in Moscow in the 1950s, they have since disappeared. There are no known populations in Europe in this moment.


=== Central Asia ===
The snakehead has managed to establish themselves in the countries of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, all of which used to be part of the former Soviet Union. More specifically, they are known to be in the Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Kashka-Darya since the 1960s due to both accidental and intentional releases. Since then, snakeheads have also been introduced to the Sarysu River, Talas River, and Chu River. They have become an important commercial fish in the region, with around 10 metric tons being harvested from just the Talas in 1989.


=== United States ===
The fish first appeared in U.S. news when an alert fisherman discovered one in a Crofton, Maryland, pond in the summer of 2002. The northern snakehead was considered a threat to the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and wary officials took action by draining the pond in an attempt to destroy the species. The action was successful, and two adults and over 100 juvenile fish were found and destroyed.  A man admitted having released two adults, which he had purchased from a New York City market, into the pond.
When the northern snakehead was found in Crofton, the piscicide rotenone was added to the three adjacent ponds.  The chemical breaks down rapidly, and has a half-life in water of one to three days. This method of containment kills all fish present in a body of water, and its use prevents the spread of the highly invasive snakehead.
In 2004, 19 northern snakeheads were captured in the Potomac River, and they were later confirmed to have become established (i.e., they were breeding). They are somewhat limited to that stretch of the river and its local tributaries, upstream by the Great Falls and downstream by the salinity of the Chesapeake Bay. Tests found they are not related to northern snakeheads found in other waters in the region, alleviating some concern of their overland migration. Northern snakeheads continue to be caught in the river as of 2022.
The northern snakehead has been found in three counties of Florida, and may already be established there. Apparently unestablished specimens have been found in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York City, two ponds in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a pond in Massachusetts, and reservoirs in California and North Carolina. In 2008, the northern snakehead was found in drainage ditches in Arkansas as a result of a commercial fish-farming accident. Recent flooding may have allowed the species to spread into the nearby White River, which would allow an eventual population of the fish in the Arkansas River and Mississippi River.
In the summer of 2008, an infestation of the northern snakehead was confirmed in Ridgebury Lake and Catlin Creek near Ridgebury, New York.  By August 2008, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) had collected a number of the native fish, and then poisoned the waters with a liquid rotenone formulation.  After the poisoning, the NYSDEC had to identify, measure, and additionally process the fish to adhere with New York Bureau of Fisheries procedures before disposal. The treatment plan was operated under several agents, and New York State Police were placed on stand-by in case of protests by local residents.[1]
In April 2013, sightings of the species in Central Park's Harlem Meer prompted New York City officials to urge anglers to report and capture any individuals. Ron P. Swegman, author of several angling essays on Central Park's ponds, confirmed the species had put both anglers and the State of New York's Department of Environmental Protection on high alert.
On 1 June 2013, Caleb Newton, a resident of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, caught a 7.9 kg (17 lb 6 oz) northern snakehead from the junction of Aquia Creek and the Potomac River, beating the previous world record of 17 lb 4 oz (7.8 kg) caught in 2004, in Miki, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan.

In late 2013, authorities in Maryland and Virginia were counting snakeheads in the Chesapeake Bay to better understand the impact of the introduction of the fish to the local ecosystem.  The Commonwealth of Virginia has criminalized the ""introduc[tion]"" of snakeheads into the state without specific authorization, although the relevant statute does not explain whether mere importation is sufficient to constitute ""introduc[tion] into the Commonwealth"" or whether instead release into the environment is required.
On May 20, 2014, Luis Aragon of Triangle, Virginia, caught a 17 lb 12 oz (8.05 kg) northern snakehead, which was officially listed as the biggest ever caught on rod and reel, according to the International Game Fish Association.
On May 20, 2016, Emory ""Dutch"" Baldwin of Indian Head, Maryland, boated an 18.42 lb (8.36 kg) northern snakehead in a tidal marsh of the Potomac using archery tackle.  This fish was listed as the state sport record in Maryland by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
On the night of May 24, 2018, Andrew “Andy” Fox of Mechanicsville, Maryland, shot a northern snakehead with a bow and arrow, which was officially listed as the biggest ever shot according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The record-breaking northern snakehead weighed 19.9 lb (9.0 kg), with a length of 35.157 inches (89.3 cm). The snakehead was shot in Mattawoman Creek in Charles County, Maryland, near Indian Head.
In October 2019, a number of northern snakeheads were found in a pond on private property in Gwinnett County, Georgia.
In August 2021, a 30-inch (76 cm) snakehead weighing 5 pounds (2.3 kg) was caught in a reservoir in Canton, Massachusetts.
In 2024 a snakehead was confirmed at the Duck Creek Conservation Area in southeast Missouri.
A new concern is that this fish's spreading is getting close to the Great Lakes, which it may enter and disrupt that ecosystem.


=== Canada ===
In 2012, a suspected northern snakehead was found in a pond in Burnaby, British Columbia, but further study revealed that it had been released three months or less before its capture and that it was a blotched snakehead or perhaps a hybrid involving that species. Before its exact identity was revealed, the government of British Columbia introduced legislation banning the possession of snakeheads and several other potentially invasive species. However, unlike the northern snakehead, which could establish a population in parts of Canada, the blotched snakehead generally lives only in warmer waters than those found in Canada.


== World record ==
According to the International Game Fish Association, Damien Cook, caught a world-record 9.53 kg (21 lb 0 oz) northern snakehead in Dorchester County, Maryland, United States, on 5 July 2023


== In traditional culture ==
Northern snakeheads are respected among some Chinese fishermen for their virtue, as parent snakefish are known to sacrifice themselves to protect their young. The young fish are said to rush to feed upon their mother after she gives birth and is temporarily unable to catch prey.

that I rarely return to the same place twice.
That is, unless I've been defeated the first time.
But there's one place
where I've longed to return,
a land that beat me before.
A region of unparalleled brutality,
where, for over a hundred years,
violence and blood-letting
have been a way of life.
I travelled here 25 years ago,
but had to pick my time carefully.
Since then, continuing violence and unrest
have prevented me from going back.
This is the Congo,
a region lost in the dark heart of Africa.
A land of fables, legends and spirits.
And there is one spirit in particular,
called Mami Wata,
who is said to lure fishermen
to the bottom of the river
where they're imprisoned for eternity.
Far-fetched? Maybe not.
Recently, new stories have reached me
of fishermen dragged overboard to their deaths.
So I'm heading back out there
to discover if these tales
are just fables and legends
or if something really is lurking in the depths.
My name is Jeremy Wade.
what keeps me alive is catching fish.
But some of the moments
when I've felt most alive
have been those when I was closest to death.
Only by really testing myself
do I feel I've achieved anything.
And to do this, I travel far and wide,
putting my own safety at risk,
to uncover the truth
about what lurks in the world's rivers.
I'm heading to the Congo,
one of the few places on Earth
that will still really test a fisherman.
The Congo is situated in
the tropical heart of Africa.
It is regarded as one of
the most violent places on Earth.
My plan is to travel up the Congo river,
into the interior of this vast continent
and catch myself a monster.
This region has enormous mineral wealth
but centuries of colonial exploitation
and ethnic conflict have been its ruination.
It now ranks among the poorest
and most dangerous places on the planet.
I first came here to the Congo River
with my fishing rods 25 years ago.
I was travelling through a country
known then as Zaire
and this was a country
the size of western Europe
but with almost no infrastructure,
a really difficult place to travel.
On top of that,
the country was under a dictatorship
and there was a real climate of fear at the time
and it was not really a place
that outsiders ever came to.
Certainly nobody travelling on their own,
as I was.
I was here for two and a half months
and I didn't catch a single fish
because the country being so vast
and the travelling so difficult,
it just took me all my time
to get to the river and then get out again.
But I did talk to people, I spoke to fishermen,
and I heard some stories.
Stories of fish so huge
that they are said, sometimes,
to drag the fishermen out of their dug-out
canoes, drowning them in the water.
And then, I was on my way out,
I was travelling on a big riverboat -
maybe 2,000 other passengers on that boat -
and I actually glimpsed one of these monsters.
Somebody dragged it on board
and I took a photograph.
And the memory of that fish
has just stayed with me ever since.
But recently, fresh stories
have reached my ears
of this place and they have
rekindled the memories of that fish
that I saw on the boat and they've reminded me
that me and this river
have got some unfinished business.
The people of the Congo are very superstitious.
They believe that this great river is inhabited
by the spirit, Mami Wata.
But could this water spirit
actually be a rare and massive fish
like the one I glimpsed all those years ago?
I have to find out.
I get my first real sight of
the harshness of life in this place
when we stop in a village to refuel.
Life here is cruel and unforgiving.
Just to survive takes incredible strength,
spirit, and resilience.
Merci. What's slightly disturbing about this fish
is that it's still alive.
Catfish tend to stay alive
for a long time out of water.
And if you let yourself be ruled by sentiment,
you'd bash this fish on the head,
put it out of its misery.
But if you do that,
it will go bad very quickly,
the meat will go rotten
and people aren't going to eat it.
So if you live somewhere like this,
sentiment goes out the window
and you want to keep this thing alive
for as long as possible so that it
tastes good when you eat it. Simple as that.
- Kamba. It's a kamba.
- Kamba.
This one here, this is the kamba.
This is one of the ones that grows very big.
It's a very...thick-bodied catfish...
..it's got big eyes...the eyes of a predator.
Those aren't the eyes of a fish
that snuffles around on the bottom.
It's got the er, the feelers,
like all catfish, but this mouth...
..this is an active, predatory catfish.
And that's a small version
of the animal that I'm after.
with their scaleless bodies
and whisker-like tentacles,
catfish are incredibly diverse.
There are an estimated 3,000 different species
inhabiting every continent, except Antarctica.
I have caught them
in the new world and the old,
but here, the Congo is home
to over 200 different types.
That's nearly three times as many
as in all the rivers in North America.
This is the electric catfish?
Ah...but here...
(Mimics electric buzzing)
OK, OK! (Laughs)
It's got very sharp spines here... Agh!
I'm here to catch a catfish that's rumoured
to reach eight feet in length
and weigh over 300 pounds -
a leviathan among the world's river monsters.
The local name for the Congo River is ''Nzadi''.
It means, ''the river that swallows all rivers''.
Together with its countless tributaries
it is the second largest river system in the world.
From the Atlantic Coast it coils its way
nearly 3,000 miles into Africa's interior,
draining a basin
second only in area to the Amazon.
My plan is to travel 500 miles up-river
to the village of Bonga.
This part of the Congo
was isolated from the outside world
until the arrival of colonisers
in the latter part of the 19th century.
Then everything changed
under the voracious rule
of King Leopold of Belgium.
A reign of terror turned the Congo region
into a prison state.
Men were enslaved to gather wild rubber
and their women and children
routinely had their hands chopped off
if the men failed to work hard enough.
Ten million Congolese were brutally killed.
To this day, much of this region
remains undiscovered.
This dark heart of Africa
is still as unknown to outsiders as it ever was.
I know little of what lies ahead as I venture into
one of the darkest places on Earth.
(Distant chanting)
The Congo River is the lifeblood of this region.
Villages clink to its banks.
It provides a vital transport link
and is an essential source of food.
As I venture further north, I notice
that little has changed over the last 25 years.
I'm using up valuable time
and I still have 200 miles ahead of me
before I reach the place
where I saw that giant fish.
As yet another day draws to a close,
I'm getting desperate to see
what fish are in the river.
But I have no bait, that is until the boatman
suggests a local favourite.
Soap.
Any old soap will do, it's not just er...
your...your traditional, sort of,
animal fat-based soap
but any antiseptic soap, you name it,
erm, the fish will go for it.
And one good thing about it is,
it will really give off
a good scent trail down the river.
The catfish here are said to be
among the biggest anywhere in the world.
I've set myself up in a quiet slack
on the edge of a current.
A river's a bit like a conveyor belt.
If you position yourself in the right place,
it will bring food.
This is just the kind of place
where everything settles out
and where the fish congregate.
But as the hours pass,
the only thing that's biting
are the mosquitoes.
(Clicking)
(Line clicks out quickly)
I'm pretty sure that was just the current
but every now and again you get a real surge.
But things are very quiet and that's...
I don't know.
It's quite a surprise
(Line clicks out rapidly)
Fish on!
That's a fish.
Lay this down.
I recognise this
as one of the giant catfish species,
but this is just a baby.
Even so, he gave me
quite an impressive run-around,
which is a bit scary because it's said
they can grow to over 100 times this size
and drag fishermen from their boats.
I know of catfish in the Amazon
big enough to swallow people whole.
So there's no reason why this river
couldn't be home to fish of a similar size.
Crucially for me, there is virtually
no commercial fishing here.
Unlike, say, the Amazon,
where you have a huge commercial fishing fleet
that extracts literally tonnes of fish every day.
So if there's one river in the world
where you might hope to find
a real monster lurking undisturbed
in the depths, this is it.
This is the end of the line for this boat,
and as we pull into a remote fishing village,
I get my first sight of a Congo River monster.
(Brief conversation in local language)
They call them eels.
I'm used to eels that are like...that round
and maybe 18 inches, two foot long.
These things...they're the thickness of your leg
and maybe, four, getting onto five foot.
I’ll see if we can maybe get one out
and have a proper look at one.
They're just such weird-looking creatures.
I'm not going to put my hands in the mouth.
There's some
pretty nasty-looking fangs in there.
They look sharp and they also look
quite dirty and er...unhygienic.
I think I've got an ID on these.
I think these are lungfish.
- (Hisses)
- Oh.
That is because this fish
actually has an air bladder
which is used as a lung
so it can breathe out of water.
And this is a fish which can
bury itself underground and survive droughts.
It sort of, I think, belched out a little bit of air
and then that was a... (Inhales deeply) ..took
some air in and then belched out of the gills.
Small eyes generally, on a fish,
means they don't use them much for feeding.
They're probably using vibration or...
scent in the water
more than vision to find their food.
This was caught with on a palm nut...
so...it suggests, you know,
an omnivorous feeder.
That mouth, to me,
looks like it's going to take fish.
I guess, like a lot of fish round here,
it's opportunistic,
it’ll actually chomp anything that comes its way.
But anyway, they call this an eel...
and, you know, I have to say it's the most
impressive eel that I've ever seen.
Lungfish are ancient creatures
pre-dating all animals that walk on land.
When I look at a beast like this,
Mami Wata no longer seems
such a stretch of the imagination.
Out here, stories and news
are passed on by word of mouth.
But stories can get exaggerated.
Each village we pass
thinks there are bigger, faster boats
in the villages further up-river.
I'm beginning to doubt it, but the next stopover
proves to be much more fruitful
and finally I get myself a faster boat.
So, who would have thought it?
Some rumours are true!
They said there were bigger boats,
faster boats, better engines...
I doubted it, but here I go.
This is going to take me...
very nearly to where I want to go.
It's becoming more and more like
a watery maze than a river,
I have no idea where the far bank is.
The chances are it's five or ten miles away now,
so even without all these islands
I wouldn't see it.
And I'm starting to think about the fishing.
I'm used to fishing in rivers
and this is more like an inland sea
and the big problem
I'm going to encounter is just...
..one of location, cos where am I going to
find these fish in all this water?
I'm just arriving at a riverside town
where this boat has to stop
and I'm going to have to get my things off
but it looks like there's
quite a bit of activity here.
I'm hoping I find something,
maybe a canoe,
that will take me on to the village
where I'm trying to go.
This large dug-out will take me
the final leg of my journey
to the village of Bonga.
This village is ideally situated,
being at the confluence
of two rivers, the Congo and the Sangha.
From past experience
I know that this is just the kind of place
where big fish gather to feed on small fish.
After a journey of nearly 300 miles,
I'm back in the region
where I saw that massive catfish
all those years ago.
It was also near here that I caught malaria,
the insect-borne disease
that kills millions of Africans every year.
The memories of that time
come flooding back.
As the malarial parasites
swarmed through my blood,
it felt as if a war was raging inside my body.
I went through two weeks of hell -
sweating, hallucinations and fever.
The slightest sound had my head pounding.
I thought I was going to die.
Now I’ll have to relive that nightmare
as I sit out fishing night after night
on the same stretch of river.
As I arrive at the village of Bonga,
the air is warm, thick, heavy, sluggish.
This is to be my home
for the next few weeks
and it's where my journey really begins.
I'm met by the chief, Nguema.
Luckily for me, he speaks fluent French
the language left behind
by the European colonisers.
He explains that he has been chosen
from a population of several hundred
to lead this community, which survives
entirely from fishing these waters.
Nguema brings out a covered basin,
with something moving around in the bottom.
On closer inspection,
I glimpse snake-like markings.
Whether I’ll be successful or not, I don't know.
(They speak French)
- Voila...
- Voila.
That's... Gosh, that's a fish and a half, that is.
That's a mongusu...
and that looks just like a snakehead.
But it's in Africa.
But it's so similar, so similar.
The bony head and a very muscular body.
And the other thing is they're capable
of living in...lots of them,
in a very small amount of water
so they're very...
well-adapted to, sort of,
low oxygen conditions.
I'd better put it back, I think.
Don't want him out too long.
There's just so many variations
on the fish theme, here
and just a brilliant example
of what they call ''conversion evolution''.
You get fish in a completely
different part of the world
which have the same strategy for survival
and actually look very similar.
(Speaks French)
This does sound like the place for big catfish.
The biggest he's seen
was about nine foot in length
but that was a while ago.
Nowadays, maybe five or six foot.
I mean, that's still a very big fish.
Nguema has said he will help me
in any way he can,
starting tomorrow
with a trip to meet other fishermen
so I can get the lie of the river.
The chief has let me set up camp
in an old deserted logging depot.
The previous inhabitants vanished
during the last civil war.
During the past hundred years or so,
while much of the world was marching forward,
the Congo has been retreating
back into the darkness of a bygone era.
After such a brutal history, it is to be expected
that violence breeds violence
and I can't help but feel
that the people here must harbour
feelings of antipathy towards outsiders.
My sudden appearance last night
has surprised many of the villagers.
But their main concern this morning
is the chief's brother
who failed to return from a fishing trip last night.
There are two main methods of fishing here -
drift nets and long lines
equipped with multiple hooks.
Both techniques are fraught with danger
and the chief takes me to meet fishermen
to find out more.
In my experience, this is not only
the best way to learn about the fish,
but you also get to hear stories
that normally never make it to the outside world.
we visit a tiny fishing village to meet Nkoi,
a specialist in big catfish.
(Conversation in French)
What we've got here
is a three-stage process.
You start off with one of those,
a worm...on a little hook...
..and then that's attached to a weight...
that goes down near the bottom.
we've got a bit of an old erm...
bit of an old sandal, bit of a flip-flop here.
You throw those in the river
and that gets a little fish called an mbesi.
It's a fish about that big,
and they are the preferred bait.
when you've got some of those,
you then put that, alive...
Oh, there we go.
Ah, OK. The line just attached
to the mouth there,
just threaded through
and then a big single hook
just nicked through the skin there
and then the point standing nice and clear.
So that's actually a very clean
but very effective er...
..way of mounting the bait.
There's another way of fishing
which we would call a long line.
You've got er...one main rope
and then at intervals
you've got hooks coming off
and you've got baits on those hooks.
(Speaks French)
What can happen there,
is that you're bringing that in
and you've got some hooks in the boat and...
if you've got another fish on the line,
or maybe even a couple of other fish on the line,
and they start pulling,
one of the hooks that's in the boat
can actually stick in you.
So...potentially this multi-hook method of fishing
is...is very, very dangerous.
There was one man called Mangunda...
he actually had a hook go through his hand.
Now, he luckily survived.
He cut through the line - forget the fish -
cut through the line to avoid getting dragged
into the water and to avoid serious injury.
And they then had to cut the hook
to get it out of him.
But for others the consequences
are much more serious.
At the next fishing village, I meet Ngomba,
who tells me about his friend
who was dragged from his boat to his death.
The details of the story appear to be
that a fishermen, fairly local to here,
went out one morning,
as usual, to check his lines
and he didn't come back.
(Speaks French)
what happened was that two days later
somebody found his body
and he had one of his hooks
through his shirt and actually
into the flesh of his arm.
From the situation of the man's body
and the line,
they were able to deduce
that he must have been
pulling in the line and then just somehow
got the hook caught in him.
And he was pulled over the side.
On the same line, on another hook,
was a large catfish.
The size of the catfish, well, he indicated that.
Around here, that isn't the length of the fish.
That is actually the width of the head.
So we're talking a fish well over 100 pounds.
I wonder what the chief thinks
about my mission to catch a monster catfish.
Especially in the light of this incident
and the disappearance of his brother.
we head back to the village
and join the rest of the fishermen
who are heading out
to set their hooks for the night ahead.
Nguema takes me along.
Over the coming weeks,
his help could make the difference
between success and failure.
we've got close to 100 hooks there,
all baited with er...
well, some with soap, some with bits of snail,
and this is very precarious.
Erm...I'm fairly heavy compared to
the people here, but we've got er...
..quite a wobbly boat...and erm...
the idea of pulling in a big fish
from a boat like this is er...
..is a bit interesting, to say the least.
(Speaks French)
The first weight has gone in.
It's about six feet deep.
Something like that it looked like.
what we're gonna do now
is put the line out to the middle of the river
with the hooks at intervals
and then there's a final weight
just to hold everything in place.
You get tension building up in the line...
..you get these hooks just whipping past you
as you're paddling out into the middle.
Trying this fishing for myself
brings home the reality of
that story of the fisherman
who had the hook stuck in his leg
when he was pulling in some fish.
The canoe is very unstable,
your feet are very close to coils of line,
you've got dozens of hooks in the boat
and all it needs is just...a slight slip,
a slight lapse of concentration,
and you're over the side and the consequences
can be fatal, just like that.
The chief is anxious to head back to the village
to see if there is any news about his brother.
Then I get the news I've been waiting for.
A fisherman from the village
has caught a decent-sized kamba catfish.
Argh!
There we go. You can hear the fish
actually grunting a little bit.
This is a heavy fish. I'm just, I don't know...
I'm struggling to hold this up.
It's probably a good 20 pounds, I think,
but it's very, very stocky.
I'm just thinking that head is something like
a third of the length of the whole body.
That's a very big head.
Very big, very bony...
..and the mouth is almost...you know...
the entire width of the head there.
I'm just imagining,
you've got one of these on the line
and suppose it was to give...a sudden surge...
pull the line out of your hand
and then maybe one of the...
the loose hooks that's in the boat
gets caught in you...
you lose your balance, you're over the side.
Once you're in the water
and this thing is pulling you,
actually, you know, it doesn't need to be
a big fish to keep you under the water.
And when you think about it, you've only got,
what, 30 seconds of air in your lungs?
Its power, its strength, it's not inconceivable
that a fish even this size
could possibly drag somebody to their death.
(Conversation in French)
Getting a big fish in a small, unstable canoe,
he says, ''Yes, that is dangerous.''
He's never been pulled out into the water
but he knows other fishermen
that has happened to.
And I make my way to an area of the river that,
according to the locals,
holds some of the biggest catfish in this region.
what I’ll do, I’ll have the boat here...
and then I’ll put two, maybe three, rods across
so I should have quite a good set-up
for intercepting anything
that might be on the prowl.
The catfish I'm after is most active at night
when it comes into the shallows
using its whiskers to detect prey.
It is one of the Congo's top predators.
I'm in position...nicely before dark,
which is good,
and, unlike the local fishermen, who er...
go back home, go to sleep,
come out in the morning to check their lines,
I'm gonna sit here...on the rods.
Er...the mosquitoes will be in soon,
so I shall be...
..buttoning up my shirt,
putting on some repellent,
but er, once I've done that,
it's just er, sit and wait.
(Buzzing)
Eventually, having sat through
wave after wave of mosquitoes,
I'm forced to quit and head back to camp.
The chiefs just come round,
asking if he can borrow some fuel.
His brother still isn't back from fishing.
He's now well overdue,
so what's going to happen
is some people are going to go out
and have a look, try and find him.
If that wasn't worrying enough,
I've just heard from the house next door
that, you know, the way things work here
is that there's no such thing as an accident,
everything has a cause,
and that because this disappearance comes
at the same time as my being here,
there are people starting to say
that I am responsible for this.
The atmosphere here has changed
Many of the villagers seem stony-faced.
I don't know what's going on, which worries me.
Superstition is incredibly powerful here
and I have no idea what might happen to me
if any harm comes to the chief's brother.
As I lie waiting to hear news,
I feel isolated, anxious, and vulnerable.
I knew I was heading into the unknown
when I set out on this trip...
..but I didn't foresee
anything like this happening.
(Chanting and singing)
I've just actually heard...
commotion down by the side of the water
and even without hearing the words,
I think it's good news.
I think they found him,
which is just an almighty relief.
Er...one thing it does... It just shows how...
..this kind of thing happening
is not that uncommon.
But thank goodness this time...
it's had a happy ending.
The following morning,
it's only when I talk to one of the fishermen
that I become aware of the extent of the danger
I was in last night.
If the chief's brother had not come back,
some of the villagers
were going to stone me to death.
The rules out here are very different.
And as we head out to check the lines,
I try to put the events of last night behind me.
It is now apparent how fundamental
the chief is to my success here.
Not just in helping with the fishing,
but maybe more importantly,
in ensuring my safety.
If anything were to happen to him
while he's out with me,
I dare not consider the consequences...
..and it's then we catch a snag.
It's a fish, a fish which pulled the line.
(Speaks French)
Without a second thought,
Nguema disappears into the murky water...
..and I understand now
how different our attitudes to fishing are.
This is real, about feeding his family.
I've gone into
some of the scariest waters in the world
but in this situation I'd be very afraid
to leave the safety of this wobbly canoe.
- (Speaks French)
- It's very snagged down there, very snagged.
I try to act normal and remain calm,
but this is exactly the scenario I was dreading.
He actually got caught
on one of the other hooks.
You know, it doesn't bear thinking about
if that hook had gone in...fully past the barb.
You know, you're just not going to come up.
It's becoming clear to me that the real danger
might not be the monster fish
but the process of trying to catch them
and the desperation of the fishermen
to feed their families.
And Mami Wata may not be
a supernatural being.
Perhaps she’s just a cultural invention
to soften the reality
of a premature watery grave.
Carefully we release the tangled line
in case there's a fish still attached.
It's a slow process to get all the hooks in.
Four hooks up, no fish so far.
Five hooks, no fish.
ALL the bait's gone. Six...seven...
Another one, no fish.
Eight. You can see the bits of snail coming up.
Still no fish...
Nine, empty hook.
Ten. Ten hooks on that line, no fish.
we continue on the opposite side of the river,
retrieving the other lines,
but the end result is the same every time -
nothing to take home after all that work.
66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 , 72, 73, 74, 75, 76...
76 hooks. There might be one or two
in the boat as well.
76 hooks have been out there for...
..don't know, 15 hours,
something like that, overnight,
and not a single fish.
And I'm starting to do the maths and think,
''Here I am, I'm going to fish with one hook.''
This is equivalent to me sitting by the river
for 75 nights, that's two and a half months,
and catching nothing.
It's quite a surprise.
Erm, I've seen fish in the markets
and you think,
''Ah, there's loads of fish around,''
but of course those markets
they're collection points for fishermen
operating in a wide area.
And who knows how long ago
they were caught?
Catfish can be tethered
and kept alive after capture for several weeks.
It's looking like a much, much tougher
challenge than I thought,
just catching anything here.
I recruit other fishermen to help
and put out more lines in the water.
So, we've got baits out
in different types of places.
Nothing so far.
I haven't caught my trophy fish yet,
but then, many of the villagers
haven't caught anything at all.
As well as the big ones,
they need to catch the small ones
and er, you know, too many days
not catching anything,
that's seriously bad news,
much worse news than it is for me.
As one day merges into another,
I spend the day setting long lines
and the nights fishing alone
in areas where local methods are not suited.
But day after day, the results are the same
and that presents me with a dilemma -
because if I were to catch a giant catfish,
I would normally want to return it unharmed.
But that would horrify the people
who have helped me,
who scratch a meagre existence from this river.
After recent events,
I'm beginning to understand
how intricately intertwined superstition is here
with everyday life.
This has gone from a quest
to catch a killer catfish
to a matter of survival,
not just for the villagers, but for me, too,
thanks to the power of superstition.
It's been 25 years now...
..such a long journey to get back here, but...
..so far, for nothing...
and I'm almost starting to wonder
if the last quarter of a century has maybe even...
seen an end of the giant catfish of the Congo.
And now the weather seems to be closing in.
If the rainy season comes early,
the river could become lethal to fish
and the malarial mosquitoes
unbearable to be out in.
Unlike the local fishermen,
I'm taking anti-malarials
but that didn't make any difference
last time I was here.
Er, I was just bitten so much that,
you know, the parasites
just overwhelmed my defences
and I'm thinking now that possibly
just going out every night is actually...
..possibly a little bit reckless.
As I head out again,
it's beginning to dawn on me
that the spirit, Mami Wata, might not be a fish
but a consequence of the local fishing methods.
But it is said here that the arrival of the rains
brings with it the catfish.
I feel the line, waiting to detect
the slightest sign of interest from a fish.
The mosquitoes begin their nightly assault
and the river is throwing everything at me.
I don't know what I'm going to catch first -
a fish or malaria.
But my set-up is perfect and I'm not moving.
This trip is beginning to feel like
the most difficult challenge I've ever faced.
This is another reason
for doing things the local way.
The weather's just so unpredictable,
this storm came from nowhere,
and er...you know, sitting here like this
does make you appreciate the sense there is
in the way everybody else
does their fishing here.
You know, you stay out on the lines like this
and either get soaked to the skin
or you get destroyed by the mosquitoes.
As the hours pass,
I have little to do but bail out the boat.
And, eventually, it's me that has to bail out.
(Thunder rumbles)
It really does rather seem that everything
is just conspiring against me.
I had such a good set-up there.
I had a couple of good baits out,
the boat was positioned nicely,
and if anything had been
in the mood to feed, you know,
I had the perfect ambush set...
and nicely before dark as well.
You know, the sun went down,
the darkness closed in,
- and then a few spots of rain and then...
- (Thunder)
You know, this hit.
The morning is cloaked in blackness,
an overcast sky
from the heart of an immense darkness.
It's not wise to head out alone
in these conditions,
so with no sign of the storm abating,
the chief comes to get me
to help him gather the lines.
As we head out, I think about the fisherman
who was dragged to his death
by a monster catfish on his line.
weather like this
makes everything more hazardous.
The rough river releases rafts of debris,
soap and heavy rain
make the boat incredibly slippery,
washing the hooks and lines around my feet.
This will put to the test
everything I have learned in my short time here.
Again I wonder if the chief is testing me...
and again I cannot afford to lose face.
(Jeremy groans)
(Conversation in French)
The line, when it's tight,
it's really hard to undo the knot here.
which can mean it's a fish.
So I need to make sure that once I've untied it
I've got a good grip on it.
- OK...
- (Thunder)
I'm clambering over the hooks here.
My hand's on the hooks.
I don't like that, but...
OK.
I'm getting absolutely soaked...
but I don't mind that, if that's fish.
Hey...it's a fish. There's a fish. There's a fish!
(Thunder)
(Speaks French)
The stories I've heard
are racing through my head
and I'm thankful to have
the chief controlling the boat.
Most fishermen here normally go out alone.
I thought I felt something else possibly.
Something's moving down there.
Two fish can mean double the power.
That's kicking, that's kicking.
Got to be... Got to be careful it doesn't...
pull this line out
and send those other hooks flying.
Fortunately, it looks like
they've already lost a lot of their power
struggling to get off the lines.
Luckily, these fish have probably
been on the line for a little while.
Let's get all this line well clear from me.
I can feel something else pulling.
I think there's something pulling
on the end of this one.
There is. There's a kick definitely.
I’ll just get this hook sorted.
(Speaks French)
There we go.
wow! How about this? How about this?
Nothing, nothing, nothing...
and I think it could have been the rain...
It's quite possible it was the rain
that got them going.
Three nice-sized tsuni there.
The weather's kicking off, though!
- I mean, it's coming...
- (Thunder)
It's getting worse. Lightning.
I want to have a look at these fish
but the priority should be
to get back to the village,
have a good look at them there.
My priorities, I realise, have changed.
25 years ago I left the Congo feeling cheated
for not having caught the big fish.
I returned determined to settle the score
but I'm leaving feeling humbled
by this great river
and the people that eke out a meagre existence
in this crucible of violence.
Again, I didn't catch the big one.
Maybe they're no longer here,
but I did discover that the three I caught
could be more than capable
of pulling a fisherman overboard
if you're using the hazardous local methods.
Inside of just being abstract jottings
in my notebook...
..you know, I came to really understand how...
those accidents could have happened.
You're in a narrow, wobbly canoe.
Maybe there's waves and wind
complicating the situation.
There's a fish on the end. It's pulling.
And you lose your concentration for a moment
or happen to slip at the moment
that fish makes a lunge.
You've got a loose hook,
it flies through the air very easily,
it's in your hand, it's in your leg,
you're over the side.
And, actually, in that situation,
even a fish this size,
you're not gonna have a chance against it.
This is gonna pull you under.
You cannot pull against a fish even this size.
The story of Mami Wata luring fishermen
to their deaths is a fantastical one.
But one that, in the end, I could not debunk
because the truth
is every bit as frightening as the myth.
For me, Mami Wata does exist.
Not as a spirit, but as an entity created
by the realities of life here -
the need to win food day after day
from this hostile and mysterious river.","The vundu (Heterobranchus longifilis) is a species of large airbreathing catfish found widely in rivers and other freshwater habitats of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the Nile. It is also called the sampa, cur, lenda, or certa.


== Description ==
The vundu is the largest true freshwater fish in southern Africa, reaching up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in length and 55 kg (121 lb) in weight. (Bull sharks are also found in southern Africa and reach a larger size, but occur in both fresh and saltwater.) Few other catfish have such large second dorsal fins (adipose fins) or such long barbels as do the vundu. Its barbels nearly reach to the origin of the pelvic fin. The colour of Heterobranchus longifilis is light to dark olive brown on its dorsal surface, getting lighter over the mid-body to a light brown. Its belly is off-white. Fins are usually light brown.
In aquaculture, it is sometimes hybridized with another very large species, the African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus), resulting in offspring known as ""Hetero-clarias"".


== Habitat and range ==
The vundu is found widely in rivers and other freshwater habitats of sub-Saharan Africa, only extending beyond this region in the Nile (although it is rare in the lower sections of this river). Among others, it is found in the Benue River, Volta River, Niger River, Gambia River, Senegal River, Lake Chad, Omo River, Congo River Basin, Lake Rukwa, Lake Kariba, Zambezi River, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Edward.
The vundu is generally uncommon, but it is not considered threatened despite having declined locally. Most active at night, it feeds on any available food, including invertebrates and insects when small, then fish and other small vertebrates when large. It scavenges off large carcasses and offal from riverside villages. It can live for 12 or more years. The vundu can survive out of water for extensive periods of time. 
Due to impaired vision, they rely on vibrations and smells in search of food. They love to remain in deep water for eating any available food they need.
The vundu eating habits affect many aspects of their lives; their growth, feeding efficiency, and body mineral composition. If they are raised in captivity and fed a soy based or cotton based meal their growth will reduce significantly. Changing the vundu's diets partially is okay, but changing them completely is detrimental to an extent because of the lack of protein they receive in a given meal.

Alaskan Horror,White Sturgeon,Sinosturio transmontanus,"I'm Jeremy wade,
biologist and extreme angler,
in search of freshwater monsters.
I normally track down these beasts
in the tropics.
I've never searched for one
in the subarctic before.
On these lakes,
deep in the Alaskan wilderness,
people have been going missing
without trace
for as long as anyone can remember.
There are native myths
of a monster that's killing them.
People just disappeared out of their boats.
whatever it was, they were afraid
it would come up and swallow 'em.
It has no fear of taking on boats
and their propellers.
There have been many strange sightings,
as well.
He said he could see on the surface of the water
a large octopus.
He judged the length of the arms
to be near 100 feet.
I'm going to investigate whether
there really is a deadly monster from
the deep killing all these people.
It's quite possible
this is the biggest fish I've ever..
had on the end of my line.
One of my obsessions is
tracking down freshwater monsters
throughout the world's rivers.
But a story of one monster in an Alaskan lake
particularly caught my imagination.
There are many myths of lake monsters
all around the world,
from places such as Loch Ness in Scotland
and Lake Tianchi in China.
No one's sure these creatures
have actually been seen.
But this monster in Lake Clark
in Iliamna is different.
Since the 1940s, bush pilots have
been flying over this remote area,
and sightings seem to be getting
more and more frequent.
There are reports of it being up to 20 feet long.
What are these mysterious shapes in the water?
Are they causing people to drown
and disappear into the depths
without leaving a trace?
People have tried to prove
its existence for many years.
30 years ago, there was even
a $100,000 reward put on its head.
That's half a million in today's money.
This kind of bounty attracted many
monster hunters, from serious fishermen
to someone who tried to lure it out of the water
by playing music.
ALL these attempts failed.
And, eventually, the reward was withdrawn.
With still no hard proof, it would be easy
to dismiss this monster as pure fantasy.
But I believe these stories
must have come from somewhere.
And there is something
down there in the depths.
This is my first trip to Alaska.
And my journey starts by going
deep into its wilderness.
I normally fish in the tropics.
And I'm out of my element
in a land of bottomless, icy lakes...
jagged mountains...
and Arctic tundra.
As a proportion of its population,
more people go missing
in this forbidding landscape
than in any other state in the US.
The best way into this isolated area is by plane,
threading your way through
narrow mountain passes,
where conditions can deteriorate in a moment.
There are many legends of this monster.
But between the smoke of the clouds
and the mirrors of the lakes,
could it actually exist?
My investigation to find out will focus on
two connected bodies of water.'
Lake Clark and Lake Iliamna,
which together cover
an area of over 1,000 square miles -
roughly the size of Rhode Island.
The larger of the two, Lake Iliamna,
is 77 miles long and 22 miles wide,
making it the largest freshwater lake in Alaska.
Both lakes reach staggering depths
of up to 1,000 feet.
with such a vast area of water, I've probably
got more chance of winning the lottery
than catching this monster on my own.
The best way to start my search
is to gain some local knowledge.
Quite a few communities
are dotted around the lakes.
These are the people who will have
been here for generations.
And these’ll be the people who have
the stories about the monster,
the people I want to talk to.
People have lived on this land
for more than 7,000 years.
And for centuries,
they've fished these lakes,
wearing lightweight waterproof parkas
made from seal gut.
These isolated communities
have a strong ancestral tradition
of myths and legends,
including the lake monster.
I'm meeting up with the Hill family,
who are Athabaskan native Alaskans.
They have a fishing camp on
the northern shore of Lake Iliamna.
If you look at the shape
of Iliamna Lake on the map,
it has a shape of a fish.
There's a large head, tapering down to...
- A tail.
- ..a tail.
And the legend is,
that's how this lake was formed.
It was this huge fish that was
trapped by the mountains.
And when a fish is dying,
or Iaying on its side, it flops.
And kind of makes a hole.
Some people say even the name,
Iliamna, means a great, black fish.
Could this be biting holes in people's boats?
People just...wouldn't paint their boats
a certain colour.
And you didn't wanna paint
the bottom of the boat red.
I guess there was some connection
between painting the bottom
of a boat red and it disappearing.
The red could've attracted
the predatory monster,
thinking it was blood from some injured prey.
These legends of the monster
are clearly ingrained within local culture.
The problem with oral history is
it can be very hard to pin down
exactly when something happened.
If you take...
one generation to be roughly 25 years, then...
just four tellings of a story
can span 100 years.
So, going back from today,
just 20 generations
takes us back 500 years,
the time when Columbus
was arriving in America.
And look at this. You only need
to go back just 40 generations
to take you back 1 ,000 years.
That's the time when
William the Conqueror was invading Britain.
The problem with stories passed
from one generation to the next
is they're not like newspapers -
they don't have a date.
So, something that you hear,
it could've happened 1 ,000 years ago.
Or maybe it happened just last week.
Is there really still something down there?
Or are they talking about an animal
that died a long, long time ago?
I need to find stories of the monster
that are still within living memory.
And I've found one on Lake Clark.
Pilot and town mayor,
Glen Alsworth Senior,
recalls what happened
to an aircraft mechanic in the late 1940s.
A gentleman working for us
was trying to catch these large lake trout,
but he kept having them break the line.
And so, being an aircraft mechanic,
he got some aircraft cable,
which is very, very strong.
So, on his normal lake trout tackle,
he was getting broken off several times?
- So, that's when he put the cable down there?
- He kept getting broken off.
The mechanic then fashioned his own
hook and fixed it to the end of the cable.
This was then tied to
a washed up tree stump.
He knew that he had a line there
that fish would not break.
And so, he decided whatever kind of
monster was busting off his line,
that wasn't gonna happen to him again.
Confident that he'd get his fish this time,
he left and planned to come back
the next morning.
A neighbour that lived by the river
observed...that stump...
..passing by against the wind.
And the lake was very rough.
And the gentleman that observed this
was very surprised.
How could this tree stump
be moving against the water?
Against the wind and the waves.
That is one of the most amazing
fishing stories I've heard.
Because, from what you describe
about the stump,
it sounds like a few men
would struggle to shift it.
And something in the water
has just ripped it out of the bank,
dragged it across the lake,
and, to this day, nobody knows what it was.
And, you know, it could still be...
down there somewhere.
That's quite a thought.
Glen has told me
the exact spot where the stump,
weighing nearly 200 pounds, was ripped
from the shore and dragged into the water.
I'm going to see what I can catch
at this location.
I've brought a tent, I've brought my rod.
And I'm going to be throwing a bait...
into this very same...area of the lake.
I've got some pretty thick cable with me.
This is probably about...
this is about 250-pound breaking strain.
The thing about the stump is, there was no...
no give anywhere in the system,
so that's why it got ripped out.
But if you can actually
let the fish have some line,
this, fished correctly, stands more chance
than a bit of aircraft cable tied to a stump.
This is not the kind of rod
you'd normally see being used in freshwater.
This is sort of a...
marine big game rod.
It would normally be put to use pulling in...
shark, marlin, tuna - that kind of thing.
But, everything I've heard about this place,
there's stuff in here
every bit as big as those animals.
A fish the size of what I've been
hearing could actually sink a boat,
if you're attached...
attached to it on a line.
You know. If that line jams.
So I will be carrying a knife.
Because the worst case scenario
is something sounding...
heading towards the bottom,
the line getting jammed.
And I'd rather lose the fish than lose my life.
There's a steep drop-off
that's further than I can cast the heavy line.
So I'm using a kayak to get my bait
to a spot where a giant might hide.
I'm actually glad I'm only about
20 yards out into this lake, not 20 miles.
I can really see how this lake
just takes on a totally different character
once you're actually out on it...in a small boat.
Something that could drag
a tree stump into the lake
could easily knock a small boat over.
The water in these lakes is only 50 degrees.
If I was tossed into the water here,
my body would seize up and I'd drown.
In these icy waters, bodies sink rather than float.
And at depths of up to 1,000 feet,
mine might never be found.
with the bait out, the plan is to leave it
Lying  on the bottom overnight.
And see if I can tempt the monster onto my line.
It's just a waiting game now.
It's getting close to night.
But, during the Alaskan summer,
it never gets completely dark.
It's actually very strange being up
in the Alaskan night, because...
..it's well after midnight now and...
I can see the far bank.
I can see the horizon there,
I can see the mist over the mountains.
It's a very, sort of, strange...other-worldly place.
The bait has been in the water
for over 12 hours.
If the monster was nearby and hungry,
it would've taken it by now.
There's nothing there.
The bait's still there.
When the weather comes in,
the lakes are covered in an eerie fog.
I heard this story about something coming
again and again for...
fish in the water.
And er...I went there and...
offered a prime piece of fish.
And just nothing doing at all.
The stories I've heard from the Alaskan natives
shroud these lakes in myths and legends.
Such as, if you see the monster,
a tragedy will soon befall your family.
In conditions like these,
the brain becomes very suggestible.
And it's easy for your mind to play tricks on you.
I actually thought I saw something back there.
And I did a real double-take.
But...I think it was just
the dark, long face of a wave.
And I can really imagine how,
if you're out here any amount of time...
..you're gonna see things,
even if there's nothing there.
This place has a special atmosphere.
But I'm a rationalist. I've got to stay detached
and not let my imagination get in the way.
To move this investigation on,
I need to find out
if people have actually
come into contact with the monster.
Hello, Bill.
I'm meeting up with Bill Trefon,
who is Alaskan native Dena'ina.
His family has been living
on Lake Clark for generations.
I heard that your parents had an encounter
with some large...unknown creature
in the lake a while ago.
what did they think it was?
And there are pike in the lake?
Big pike in the lake?
Did your mother have any idea...
how big it might have been?
12 feet.
Going back generations, people say
that if you actually see one of these big fish,
it's like a bad sign.
Tragedies like Bill's father drowning
only help to strengthen the legends
surrounding the monster.
But this story has given me some
vital information as to what it could be.
Attacking a propeller suggests
it is a sight predator.
It's not some deep water scavenger,
but it's active on the surface.
This all fits with it being a pike,
which is what Bill's mother thought she saw.
To see if the pike here really can
reach such a monstrous size,
I have to catch one.
This is Chilitma  Bay, near where
the boat was attacked and where
locals say the biggest pike are.
I've come across pike in warm water before.
But I've no idea how big they can grow
in these glacial conditions.
A pike has hundreds
of needle-sharp teeth
that can cause serious damage
to whatever gets into its mouth.
Including humans.
I'm using here...an imitation frog.
And...I've got this little clip here,
which goes under the hook.
And the idea of that is
it brushes off any weed.
So I can chuck this right into
the middle of the weed,
and twitch it, and so the legs
actually kick as I twitch the tip.
Agh! whoa!
Went for it,
but I was a little bit over-excited there.
And that was right in the weeds.
I'm very impressed by the er...
the aggression of the fish
that had a go at the frog.
That was only a small fish.
If that had been a bigger one,
there'd have been an almighty splash.
But er...I think a lot of people
who don't fish are very surprised.
You see a placid bit of water like this...
and you throw something small in the water
and they’ll just launch themselves at
what they think is a piece of food.
Oh... No. Oh, yes. There's a fish on!
There's a fish on.
It's a very gentle take. And it's a pike.
It's not a very big one.
whoa! Jumping... Look at that!
That thing jumped out of the water
a couple of foot. Ooh! He's gone.
OK. Managed to throw the hook.
But...anyway. There are pike in here.
So, I've had a pike on the end of my line.
That was very exciting.
It jumped clean out of the water.
Glen Alsworth Junior
has seen many times how voracious
the pike around here can be.
- You've seen them take birds.
- Yeah. Yeah.
I've seen 'em take birds. I've seen
'em take baby and adult ducks.
I saw one eat a muskrat once, in this river.
Pretty much anything
they can fit their mouth around.
It's not even tempting to get your
hand in there when releasing one.
Two weeks ago, I had uh...
Releasing one by the tail, it turned
and did a 180, a small 30-inch pike,
and it took a bite out of my hand
as I was releasing it.
And so after it bit a hook already,
then it came for my hand after that even.
If it would've been a 40-inch fish,
it probably would've took...
done some damage to my tendons
and my fingers.
If a four or five-foot pike
can eat water fowl and mammals,
it seems logical that a 12-footer
could be a man eater.
So what I've got here is a lure
that sends out very strong signals.
It's a very bright flash...
..and a very strong vibrating throb.
That was probably what happened
when that fish went for that propeller.
Fish on, fish on! Fish on!
Oh, it's a nice size fish.
It's a nice size fish. Here we go.
That's a nice fish. He's going under the boat.
I don't want him to go the other side.
Look at that!
Lovely fish. Lovely clear water.
So you can see the fish really well.
A lovely Alaskan pike.
Just do a quick measure here.
40 inches. Lovely fish.
A 40-inch pike is probably around 20 years old.
The thing about a pike,
if there's ever a fish where...
the way it looks tells you about
the way it lives, that is the pike.
You know. Head full of teeth at one end,
not just on the jaws,
but on the tongue, on the gill rake as well.
And they have eyes that make them
a deadly sight predator.
You can really see here
these sighting grooves...
sort of converging on the prey here.
So, a bit like sighting grooves on a... on a rifle.
And they can just...
judge the distance to the prey.
And they're so wonderfully camouflaged,
blending into weed.
Very long, streamlined shape,
and then you've got
the dorsal fin right at the back,
so you've got a big propulsion unit.
As soon as that prey comes within range,
it lunges and, once it's in those
teeth, there's no getting away.
So, just a perfect predator, this fish.
There she goes.
I've seen that pike can certainly be aggressive.
They’ll hit a piece of vibrating,
flashing metal on the end of a line.
I suppose that, once in a while,
they might possibly hit a boat propeller.
The thing that's bothering me
is that Bill's mother
talked about seeing something
that was 12 foot long.
And...pike just don't get that big.
They'd be really pushed
to reach even half that length.
And at that size, they're not gonna
be knocking anybody out of a boat,
and they don't pose a threat
to anybody in the water.
So I'm doubtful that what Bill's
parents encountered was a pike.
But I do believe that what they encountered
could have been the lake monster.
But what is there in the water
that can reach that kind of size?
Something monstrous could have come
in from the sea into Lake Iliamna.
Connecting the two is the Kvichak River,
which is 50 miles long.
Just seen some dark specks on a tiny island
down there, hauled out on some gravel.
Those are freshwater seals.
This is one of very, very few places in the world
where you have seals in freshwater.
It brings home the fact that,
although we call this expanse of water a lake,
it's huge - and if seals have managed
to get in here from the ocean,
it makes you wonder
what else might have got in as well.
Salmon sharks, a close relative
of the great white, have been seen in the area.
But they can't live in freshwater,
so that has to rule them out.
But there is one animal
around Alaska's shores
that's big enough to be the monster
and can survive in freshwater.
Beluga whales are big enough to be
the monster and can live in both
salt and freshwater.
Could they have swum up
the Kvichak River into Lake Iliamna?
The shallowest part of the river is The Braids,
a labyrinthine area of channels.
And they'd have to swim through here
to get into the lake.
My pilot, Glen Alsworth Junior,
knows the area well.
This looks like about, what?
Er...five or six miles?
- Something like that?
- Yeah. There's about five miles
where it's braided this way.
And the deeper channels, of course,
you can see the darker blue water...
where the deeper channels are and the lighter
brown where there's more silt deposit.
This water here, there looks to be
some pretty good channels through.
I think er...you've certainly got
eight or nine foot in places.
It might come up to two or three here and there.
But, apparently, people navigate
these waterways with prop boats
without chewing up their propellers, so...
It looks as if there's enough water
for belugas to get up into the lake.
The thing about belugas is
that they are mammals.
They breathe air,
so they have to surface regularly.
In that case, even with the sparse
human population round the lake,
the sightings would be much more
common than they have been.
whatever the monster is,
it's something that stays submerged and hidden
for long periods of time.
On top of that, the people here
know what belugas look like.
If the lake monster was a beluga, frankly,
it wouldn't be a mystery.
I'm drawing a bit of a blank with suspects so far.
So I'm going to come at this
from a different angle.
I’ll investigate the monster's
potential food source.
Legends of the famous Loch Ness
monster have been dismissed by some
because there isn't enough food in the lake
to support an animal of that size.
Is there enough food in Lake Iliamna
to feed a monster?
There is one event each year in these waters
that could be what I'm looking for.
Every July, there is the world's
largest run of sockeye salmon.
I'm normally busy catching river monsters
in the warmest parts of the world.
And fishing for salmon is totally new to me.
The temperatures
have affected things a little bit.
So the run is... The timing is
a little bit off from normal years.
But it should be a good place
to have the salmon start packing in.
With all this water, and the unpredictable nature
of the salmon run,
it can actually be quite hard to find the salmon.
But one very good way to find them
is to look for bears, because...
that's the only reason they're by the water -
to feed on the salmon.
And actually, we've just spotted our first bear.
So we're going to er...
come in and have a closer look here.
This is bear country,
and they depend on the salmon run for food -
so I’ll be in direct competition with them
for the best fishing spots.
we're only about 65 miles from where
self-styled grizzly expert
Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend
were eaten alive by a hungry grizzly.
Is this the place where
we saw the bear from the plane?
Yes. You can see a very regular bear trail
where they're coming and going from the river.
If a bear comes close to us,
we’ll stand side by side and
try to look big, like they do.
Then, typically, they’ll just move
around you and then move off.
If a bear's trying to fish in an area, though,
the last thing we wanna do
is for that bear to think
that we want the fishing hole
and we expect it to move.
So, if they want it, we’ll let 'em have it.
Carrying a gun at all times is common
practice in the Alaskan wilderness.
And, in case a bear does attack,
my pilot, Glen Alsworth Junior,
is carrying a 50-calibre handgun.
The bears may have already found
a good fishing spot.
Just literally 15 feet from where I'm standing,
there's been a steady procession of fish
through, working their way upstream.
And there's also some big, dark
groups holding further down.
So I'm looking forward
to getting a line in the water.
There are no bears in sight, so it seems safe
to try and catch my first salmon.
When sockeye salmon come out of
the sea and enter freshwater,
the males undergo
a monstrous transformation.
They develop a hooked jaw and grow
teeth to defend their spawning grounds.
Not only that, both the males and
females turn red and stop feeding.
So they won't go for any bait or fly.
what you're doing is, you're casting out...
You've got a lump of lead here and
you flick it 45 degrees upstream.
It comes down and the fish are all
facing upstream.
And the idea is,
they've got their mouths open, like this,
and it gets in their mouth.
That panics them, they run
and, as they run...
that ends up in the mouth.
So it feels like a strike.
And that will be in the mouth,
probably like that.
But they're not actually going for it.
That's the theory. Let's see.
Time to try and get my first salmon.
There you go. You got it.
Agh! He's off.
I actually hooked one.
That was a bit of a surprise.
The line just was ticking down...
And they haven't spooked off too far.
..just ticking down, it just stopped,
and I was a bit too surprised.
I pulled. I should've tried to
set the hook a bit more on that one.
with this many salmon around,
it's not long before the bears
return to their fishing spot.
Here's a bear, just coming
out of the brush on the far side.
Whereabouts is it, Glen?
He's just looking out of the brush,
watching for salmon.
Oh, yeah. That's a very definite
fisherman's posture, isn't it?
You can tell he's ready
to pounce down in the water.
Within minutes,
three large grizzlies have surrounded us.
Our day on the river
has suddenly become dangerous.
This is typical. You find a good spot,
somebody else comes in, tries to elbow you out,
though, in this case, I'm going to
make a graceful retreat.
He may turn back.
There's fish between us and the bear.
Definitely a good time to keep talking,
keep making noise.
That way, if he has his nose under
the water, he can still hear us
and doesn't end up popping
out of the water close to us
and having to make a decision
about how he's gonna react.
With the bears this close,
I can pick up some fishing tips.
I think he needs a bit of practice.
It's almost on a level with
my early fly-fishing attempts.
They wait till there's a bunch of
fish congregated underneath them.
And then just jump on top of them that way.
Cos I guess, a bit like a human fisherman,
if there's lots of fish, even if you're a bit inept,
you're still going to...
you're still gonna get something.
Once they've moved off a bit,
I can carry on trying to catch my first salmon.
But these grizzlies are putting me to shame.
Agh!
Fantastic to see these bears close up.
I wasn't expecting that.
You can see they're semi-aquatic.
I don't think this is the lake monster.
But you could call it, in some ways,
a bit of a river monster.
Ah! Here we go.
Believe it or not, this is the first salmon
I've ever had on the end of my line.
This is a fish that can swim hundreds of miles
up these fast-flowing rivers to get
to its spawning grounds.
So it can put up a strong fight.
Fish has done me a favour.
It's turned off the main flow.
I'm so engrossed with catching a salmon,
I don't notice our interested onlooker.
Out of the water! Out of the water!
OK, OK. Right. I think...
We're gonna want to break the fish off.
(Claps noisily)
(Shouting and clapping)
Does he want the fish?
This bear is clearly not afraid of us.
And that's a problem.
Shall we just break it off?
(Shouting)
I'm just gonna break the fish off.
This is a young grizzly.
But, although not fully grown,
it could still attack and kill any one of us.
You can have the fish.
Luckily, it's more interested
in the salmon than us.
It took my fish.
And, a minute later, it's back for more.
This time, we need to fire a warning shot.
I'm gonna fire one.
- He's getting too pushy.
- (Shouts)
- No!
- You guys, plug your ears.
- (Gunshot)
- Just deep breaths.
Just calm down. It's all...
all part of the er...
the day in the life of a fisherman
in this part of the world.
Even after a warning shot, the bear won't leave.
So it's best that my film crew and I get out.
I didn't quite succeed
in landing my first salmon.
But it's clear that they are a vital
food source to the whole area.
with millions of salmon coming in every year,
and fish like pike in these waters year round,
I'm convinced that there is enough food to
sustain the monster I've been hearing about.
Back on the trail of the monster,
my investigation has taken a leap forward.
This could be the breakthrough I've needed.
I'm meeting up with Robyn Levine,
who saw the monster last year
while coming in to land on Lake Iliamna.
Hello. Lovely place to work.
Robyn is an anthropologist
who works on these lakes,
studying subsistence fishing
by the Alaska native people.
And it was round here you saw
the monster, as well, I gather.
Yes. The Iliamna Lake monster.
She's trained to observe things accurately,
so has a clear description of what she saw.
Robyn is going to show me exactly
where she saw the monster from the air.
There's the drop-off, yeah?
You see the clear shallow right over there?
- Yeah?
- Um, that's where...we saw it.
Right there. It was over on that very clear patch.
Oh, really?
we probably had a good 30 to 40 seconds,
maybe longer, to see it.
Initially, I thought it was a seal.
But, almost immediately after
that thought crossed my mind,
I realised it was...far too big
and it moved differently.
It had a long, broad head...
..blunted nose.
There were very distinct...
pectoral fins, fins on the side of the fish.
what about the size of this?
As we were pulling into the bay
where we were landing,
and my friend was coming
to pick us up in his boat,
I estimated that...
what we saw was about the same size
as his boat.
And that's...15 to 18 feet long.
18 feet is the same size
as three of me end to end.
And much bigger than what Bill's
mother saw attacking her boat.
It looked so normal.
I've seen beluga from the air.
I've seen seals from the air.
It looked a part of the natural environment,
and I was sure there was some obvious
explanation for what we saw.
This is the breakthrough I needed.
A graphic description of its shape
from somebody who saw it recently
and who observed it clearly for some time.
And, from her description,
the thing that struck me most
was how much she emphasised its fins.
Now, on a normal fish seen from above,
like salmon, you don't see the fins,
because they're tucked in or folded away.
But there are certain fish where,
particularly, the pectoral fins behind the head
really stick out, a bit like wings, almost.
This is a crucial bit of the description.
And I now really do think
I have my prime suspect.
I've now got a strong suspicion that
the monster I've been looking for
is a white sturgeon.
It's a living dinosaur that has changed
very little over 65 million years.
Their range is all along
the west coast of North America,
from mid-California all the way up to Alaska.
They can survive in both salt and freshwater.
And I've also seen how the river
that connects Lake Iliamna to the sea
is easily deep enough for them to swim up.
Even though they're bottom feeders,
they have an interesting behaviour.
They can jump out of the water.
In recent years, a relative of theirs,
the gulf sturgeon,
has been seriously injuring people in Florida.
Could jumping white sturgeon
in Lake Iliamna and Lake Clark
be the basis of the myths
of fishermen going missing?
Could they be causing people to disappear...
..knocking them out of their boats
and into the freezing water?
To prove my case,
I need to get my hands on a big sturgeon.
However, what we're talking about here
is an absolutely immense body of water,
where nobody has ever caught one
and where the sightings
are less than once a year.
So, to get one on the end of a line,
if I had 40, 50 years,
I might be in with half a chance.
But, realistically,
it's just not gonna happen here.
My challenge has always been
to catch this monster.
And, by hook or by crook, I'm going to get one.
with the odds stacked against me here,
I'm leaving Alaska
and going down to the Coiumbia River,
on the Oregon/Washington border.
Here, they have a large population
of white sturgeon.
And I’ll have a much better chance
of catching one.
This will be another first for me.
I've never caught a white sturgeon,
and I hear they can put up an incredible fight.
This line, although it's very fine, is actually er...
it actually has a breaking strain of 100 pounds.
It's braided line.
The thing about this is, it's nice and supple.
So er...it's not going to drag a lot in the water.
But another thing about it is, it's got no stretch.
Virtually no stretch, compared to
nylon monofilament normal fishing line.
what that means is,
if I hook a big fish with this,
I haven't got that elasticity of the line.
I'm gonna feel everything
very, very directly up here.
So it's gonna be quite a physical um...
struggle with the fish on this gear.
So, just one final detail.
what we're using here is a barbless hook.
There's no barb on there.
That's very much about
just looking after the fish.
We need to go quick!
We're on the backing. we're on the backing.
I'm going to drop this bait into
about 80 feet of water.
There we go. It's fully rigged.
I think it's still sinking.
That's going down in about 80 foot of water.
And it's bumped the bottom.
Bring it in there.
That's fine.
Any time now, something could take that.
One very obvious difference
between here and Lake Iliamna
is that here you've got a current -
the water is moving.
whereas in a lake, in still water,
the bait sits there and
the scent diffuses out very slowly.
There can be fish not very far away,
maybe not aware that it's there.
But er...moving water here,
that bait is really advertising
itself down the current.
Oh!
That's a bit of a knock again there.
Bit of a knock.
Something's definitely interested in it.
It's at that point where...
all your imaginings about
what's under the water...
they are... well, they're starting to take shape.
whatever it is is on the end of that line.
But that line is so fine...
the water here's pretty deep,
70 foot or so.
I'm attached to something.
That's a... There it is,
there it is, there it is!
There it is!
My first white sturgeon, and the animal, I think,
can easily grow to become a lake monster.
It's a bit of a tug of war, this. I just bring it up...
..and then...
Hook out.
While taking the hook out, my chance
to finally see the monster up close eludes me.
That was a very, very brief contact
with the animal there.
I was leaning over the side.
I couldn't reach as far as I wanted.
The sturgeon are clearly here,
and that one was about five feet long.
But I want a larger one.
white sturgeon can grow to about 20 feet.
It's not long before I get my next bite.
And this one feels much bigger.
This fish could be bigger than I am.
when the fish wants to go, I'm letting it go.
But I'm letting it go...under pressure.
It's having to work for the line it takes away.
And then, when the fish takes a bit of a breather,
I'm hoping, you know, in those little gaps,
that I can...gain a wee bit of line.
I think we might have to...
It might be an idea to cast off.
I think it might help if we cast off.
Are we going? Are we on our way?
This is a long, long run.
We're running out of line here.
We're running out of line.
We need to go quick.
we're on the backing. we're on the backing.
Wait a minute.
That's the end of my line there, off the reel.
I wanna get the proper line back on the reel.
Right. There we are. we've got the line
back on the reel. That was hairy.
I was watching my line going.
That line's coming up on the water.
There's the fish. There's the fish! There it is.
There we go. There we go, there we go.
There we go.
Agh! I've seen the fish now.
That is certainly a big fish.
It's taken me half an hour
to bring this sturgeon in.
Knowing that this is only around
half the length they can grow to,
I now totally believe that a larger
one could drag a tree stump into the water.
That was a tiring fight.
I've caught some big fish in freshwater.
This is probably the biggest
freshwater fish I've caught.
Er...about 300 pounds, this one.
So, you know. A real monstrous fish.
Another thing that's very notable about this fish
is that it's got very small eyes
for such a large animal.
I think what that tells you is,
vision doesn't play
a very big part in its world,
finding its way around and also finding food.
And, if you look a bit closer at the head,
you see those four feelers...
hanging down near the mouth.
That's how it tastes the water,
how it found the bait,
the scent trail coming down
the current led it to my bait.
Also interesting, there's such
amazing patterning all over the fish,
but here on the snout,
you've got these vibration sensors.
The kind of thing that most fish have
down the lateral line,
to pick up any vibrations in the water,
which could tell them where prey is.
It's just like, if you're a human being,
it's just a sense we're not used to.
Just feeling vibrations.
But very, very apparent there, that...
a fish like this lives in a different world,
perceives its world differently
down there in the dark water, 90 foot down.
In terms of its difference from other fish,
and in terms of its size,
this really is a remarkable creature.
That's actually 105 or even 106 inches.
That's eight foot 10 inches.
Nearly nine foot. Nearly nine foot, this fish.
It's quite a thought.
That's one and a half times me.
At nine feet, this fish is roughly 80 years old.
But they can live to over 100.
This looks big in the water,
but these things grow to...
20 foot, possibly even more.
Imagine seeing that in the water.
You could be forgiven
for saying that was a monster.
Up to 20 feet long matches
all the descriptions of the monster.
Including Robyn's. Plus, the pectoral
fins and the long, streamlined body
fit how she described what she saw.
But what about the teeth marks
on the propeller?
Just take a look at the mouth.
Although you could say it's predatory -
it's eaten quite a large dead fish -
but there's no teeth in there at all,
I can put my hands in there.
It's almost... It's very telescopic.
You can imagine that...extending and
literally sucking in a small fish.
Having only gums means it couldn't
have been teeth marks on the propeller.
But I think I know what caused them.
what's interesting about a sturgeon,
it hasn't got a bony skeleton
the way most fish have - it's just got cartilage.
But what it has got is bony plates
on the outside of the body.
Not totally covering it, but just in rows.
These are some form of protection.
They are quite tough bits of bone.
And also, a very bony head.
A very bony gill flap, as well.
I believe Bill Trefon's parents
actually ran over a white sturgeon.
And the propeller going over its bony plates
caused what looked like teeth marks.
It may not have any teeth,
but this mouth is perfectly formed
for being a bottom feeder,
eating molluscs and small fish.
This explains why it is so rarely
seen on Lake Iliamna or Lake Clark,
because it spends most of its time
in up to 1,000 feet of water.
On the rare occasions
when they do come to the surface,
this could be what is causing
some people to disappear.
Their jumping.
Nobody knows why they jump out of the water.
Maybe it's a panic reaction to being disturbed.
But when they do, an airborne giant could
easily knock somebody out of their boat
and into the icy depths.
This all makes me convinced
that the Alaskan lake monster
is actually a small,
landlocked population of white sturgeon.
But so impressive just to...
get close to an animal like that.
To touch it and look at it close up.
And I really think that,
for a few moments there,
I was actually in the presence
of the creature that is the lake monster.","White sturgeon (Sinosturio transmontanus) is a species of sturgeon in the family Acipenseridae of the order Acipenseriformes. They are an anadromous (migratory) fish species ranging in the Eastern Pacific; from the Gulf of Alaska to Monterey, California. However, some are landlocked in British Columbia, the Fraser River and Columbia River drainage, Montana, and Lake Shasta in California, with reported sightings in northern Baja California, Mexico.


== Taxonomy ==
Prior to 2025, it was placed in the genus Acipenser. However, this placement was long known to be paraphyletic. In 2025, it was moved to the revived genus Sinosturio.


== Description ==

S. transmontanus is distinguished by the two rows of four to eight ganoid bony plates between the anus and anal fin, with about 45 rays present in the dorsal fin. Coloring can range from gray to brownish on the dorsal side, paler on the ventral side, and gray fins. Barbels are situated anterior to the mouth, closer to the snout than the mouth.
At sexual maturity, S. transmontanus can reach 1.6 m (5.2 ft) in length, while the maximum length recorded of any age class is 6.1 m (20 ft), with common lengths around 2.1 m (6.9 ft). While age at maturity is uncertain, possible age ranges of known S. transmontanus specimens range from 11 to 34 years old. The most authentic record of the maximum weight of this species is reported to be 630 kg (1,390 lb), while other unauthenticated records show a higher weight estimate, as with the 816 kg (1,799 lb) estimate for an individual with a reported age of 104 years. In one 1995 study, a sample of adults weighed from 34 to 75 kg (75 to 165 lb). A specimen, considered the largest in the state in recent years, of 210 kg (460 lb) at a length of 2.8 m (9.2 ft) was recorded relatively recently in California.


== Taxonomy ==
Alternate common names include: Pacific sturgeon, Oregon sturgeon, Columbia sturgeon, Snake River sturgeon and Sacramento sturgeon. The specific name is derived from the Latin words trans (over or beyond), and montanus (mountain).

The white sturgeon is part of a Pacific clade of species including Kaluga (Sinosturio dauricus), Sakhalin (Sinosturio mikadoi), Green (Sinosturio medirostris), Chinese (Sinosturio sinensis) and Amur (Sinosturio schrenkii) Sturgeon. Recent genetic analysis supports a close relationship between (S. transmontanus) and (S. schrenckii), which is only found in Asia, showing a common ancestor between the two around 45.8 million years ago. Using microsatellites, genetic differentiation between different river systems in the Pacific Northwest and California is high enough to be able to distinguish between white sturgeon populations and validate a structure in which watershed (S. transmontanus) resides in.
Extant sturgeon species are polyploid, containing more than two paired sets of chromosomes, derived from an extinct ancestor containing 60 chromosomes. Genome duplication during sturgeon evolution has led to three different groups of species with 120, 240, and 360 chromosomes. Recent study of microsatellite inheritance in white sturgeon supports that it is an ancestral octoploid, with 240 chromosomes.


== Distribution and habitat ==
White sturgeon are native to several large North American rivers that drain to the Pacific Ocean. They primarily live in estuaries of large rivers, but migrate to spawn in freshwater, and travel long distances between river systems. Reproducing populations have been documented along the West Coast, from northern Mexico up to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. White sturgeon are commonly found in deep, soft bottomed areas of estuaries, where movements in the water column is dependent on salinity.
Historical ranges have been modified substantially by overharvesting, habitat changes due to dams, and river regulations; all affecting habitat quality, suitability and connectivity.
In the lower Fraser River, British Columbia, movement and abundance are assessed by acoustic tags and mark recapture methods. While the model developed by Robichaud, English and Nelson assumes a closed homogenous population, acoustic tags and mark-recapture data shows that they are sedentary during the winter months and mobile in the spring and fall, with data indicating that they leave the Fraser River and enter the Strait of Georgia during their mobile periods; this conclusion has been validated by microchemical evidence of marine exposure in Fraser River white sturgeon fin rays.
Construction of dams for hydroelectric power production affects seasonal movement of white sturgeon in many river systems, with the Columbia River Basin being a large contributor to shifts in the distribution and movement. The dams present in the basin have largely blocked the upstream movement of sturgeon, due to designs of fish ladders being more specified for salmon and steelhead. While downstream passage of sturgeon through the dams has been reported, the route of passage was never identified. Downstream movement through the dams are only possible through operating turbines, open spill gates and the ice and trash sluiceway.


== Diet ==
Larval white sturgeon 10–11 mm (0.39–0.43 in) in TL experience the highest mortality when they transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding, around 8–14 days post-hatch depending on conditions. Once larvae metamorphose into young of the year (YOY) and juveniles, they actively feed on the substrate, dominantly Corophium spp., relying on water currents to carry them downriver to areas of suitable food. The availability of Corophium spp. could play a key role in the survival of larval and YOY white sturgeon in the Columbia River and could possibly explain the apparent poor survival of larvae and YOY in some Snake and Columbia River reservoirs that apparently have successful spawning but poor recruitment. Juveniles less than 600 mm (2.0 ft) TL are known to feed on tube-dwelling amphipods, mysids, isopods, Corophium spp, and other benthic invertebrates, as well as on the eggs and fry of other fish species. Adults greater than 600 mm (2.0 ft) consume a variety prey species, adjusting to a piscivorous diet of herring, shad, starry flounder, goby, smelt, anchovy, lamprey, and salmon, as well as benthic items such as invasive overbite clam. With feeding movements influenced due to tidal cycles, studies show more active movement at night, hinting that white sturgeon may be nocturnal foragers.
Studies have shown that dietary lipid requirements on larval white sturgeon effect overall body composition, plasma biochemical parameters and liver fatty acids. With increasing dietary lipid levels, whole body and muscle lipid content increases, as well as increased plasma triglycerides and cholesterol content. This shows that larval sturgeon post-hatch grow faster on high lipid diets, reducing glycogen stores but increasing stores of lipid in the liver. The importance of this can help to understand growth rates in changing environments with varying food sources.


== Reproduction ==

""White sturgeons are iteroparous breeders with a spawning period in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers between mid-February to late May, with peak activity during March and April"" - Kohlhorst 1976.
There is much uncertainty around reproduction timing of events in white sturgeon, with many papers reporting differing results dependent on the river system observed. Chapman, Van Enennaam and Doroshov witnessed sexually mature females 950 mm (3.12 ft) FL in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system estimated around nine years old by using the Von Bertalannfy growth function, while the youngest sexual mature was a male 750 mm (2.46 ft) FL estimated to be six years old. However, other reports have sexual maturity for white sturgeon at twelve years old for females and ten years old for males. Uncertainty around age estimates from fin ray annulus may account for any disparity.
Spawning periodicity is thought to be two to four years for females and one to two years for males. Behavior during spawning is not well known, but it is known that they are communal broadcast spawners, where a female's eggs are fertilized by many males. When ready to spawn, white sturgeon choose a variety of substrates dependent on the river system, spawning on gravel or rocky substrate in moderate to fast currents, with observed depths of 3–23 m (9.8–75.5 ft), and water velocities at the bottom on a range of 0.6-2.4 m/sec. When eggs are released by the female, they are negatively buoyant, and develop an adhesive coat upon contact with water, which allows them to attach to the substrate near where they were spawned. Hatching time is temperature dependent, and can range from 3–13 days. Optimal temperature is between 14 and 16 °C (57 and 61 °F), with mortality observed below 8 °C (46 °F) and above 2 °C (36 °F).


== Importance to humans ==

White sturgeon are a resource to a variety of different social and economic groups around the world. Aquaculture facilities cultivate white sturgeon in California and juveniles can be sold to aquarists. They were once the main food source for Native Americans in the 1800s, until overfishing by commercial fleets for caviar drove them to near extinction by the early 1900s. Besides their meat, other important economic products associated with caught sturgeon are caviar, isinglass, and oil. While selling a wild white sturgeon and eggs is illegal in California, it is legal to buy legal caviar from California White sturgeon farms. Poaching is an ongoing issue, in which caviar can sell on the black market for US$100–150 per pound, while a consumer buying legally made caviar from California sturgeon farms pays anywhere from US$40 to $700 for an ounce.
White sturgeon also play a role in sport fishing in the Pacific Northwest, while closed to retention in the Columbia River Basin, catch and release fishing is allowed, with enough popularity for guiding services to offer fishing trips targeted specifically at white sturgeon.


== Conservation status ==
Trends in white sturgeon abundance has been monitored in California for decades, with data showing large variations in recruitment, including five or more consecutive years of low or no recruitment, with probable cause being due to low flows during winter and/or spring months. Although some present white sturgeon populations have been reduced over the past 30 years, some population trends in California are promising, resulting in new angling regulations, monitoring, research efforts, fish passage and habitat restoration.
Despite being a relatively robust population that includes tens of thousands of sub-adults and adults, management is complicated due to exposure of pollutants, freshwater and estuary alteration, harvest, and because of its long life span, which can mask detection of reproductive success. NatureServe ranks white sturgeon globally secure, but imperiled in California due to anthropogenic impacts on their habitats. The American Fisheries Society considers them to be Endangered. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora has white sturgeon listed as Appendix II, which includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.

"
Rift Valley Killer,Nile Perch,Lates niloticus,"Africa's Rift Valley is, by all accounts,
one of the most dangerous places in the world
to be a fisherman.
Storms come out of nowhere.
Giant crocs attack from beneath.
Hippos maul you to death.
And rival gangs will kill you for your catch.
But the rewards of fishing here
can be spectacular.
There are reports of rare
but very real giants living here.
So I've decided to head to one of
the deadliest fishing spots in the world
as it may be my last chance to catch
this massive river monster.
This could be my most dangerous mission yet.
(Thunder rumbles)
I'm Jeremy wade.
I've made my name investigating
improbable fishermen's tales
from around the world
and tracking down the bloodthirsty
river monsters that lie behind them.
But there's one place I've heard of
where the death rate for fishermen
apparently exceeds all others.
It's the birthplace of mankind -
the Rift Valley in East Africa.
Formed by two continental plates pulling apart,
it's a monumental scar
spanning several countries
and containing a series of lakes and rivers.
I want to find out just how dangerous it is
to fish out there.
But I also want to catch the giant
at the heart of this region.
The Mputa, or Nile Perch,
is Africa's largest freshwater fish.
And it's the reason fishermen here
have been putting their lives at risk for millennia.
Just one animal can feed an entire village.
This fish can apparently
reach weights in excess of 400Ibs
and measure over 6ft long.
They are ambush predators
and they will eat anything
they can fit in their mouths,
including cannibalising Nile Perch
up to a third of their own size.
Giants like this used to be caught regularly,
but as in so many parts of the world,
population pressures have led to over-fishing.
I thought all the big ones had long gone,
but just a few months ago,
I received some pictures
that suggest there are monster Nile Perch
still out there.
So I've travelled to the heart of Africa,
to the white Nile in Uganda -
the site of that extraordinary catch.
I'm actually now fishing in the very spot
where the largest ever Nile Perch,
which was accurately weighed,
was caught on a rod and line.
This fish weighed just slightly under 250Ibs
and was almost 7ft long.
Unfortunately, though,
that fish was attacked by a crocodile...
..and it didn't survive its wounds.
So that fish is no longer in this river,
but it's quite possible
there could be others the same size,
or maybe even bigger.
Hmm.
I'm just going to tighten it.
That was, uh...
Something definitely hit that bait, but it wasn't...
It wasn't particularly confident.
It ripped a couple of feet and then...
..and then stopped.
Oh!
I've got a circle... Oh, here we go!
Yeah, there is a fish on.
If I could get this ratchet off.
The line's coming up.
That's a Nile Perch - it's a good size one.
There it is!
In this part of the Nile,
the goal is to land fish quickly,
before the crocs come looking for easy prey.
It's a decent size Nile Perch
and a great start to my quest for a giant.
Now, this is quite an unusual capture.
It actually swallowed the bait fish head-first,
down to about here.
I think it was actually this dorsal barb
of the bait fish
that actually stopped the bait
coming out of its throat,
not the hook.
Let's just...
Oh! Let's just support it, maybe, like that.
Look at that!
Let's get down. OK.
Very nice fish - 70Ibs, something like that.
But a beautiful fish, lovely.
Beautiful colouration, very strong, as well.
The paddle-like tail and muscular body
indicate a fish designed
for power and acceleration.
These fish are ambush predators,
relying on their large eyes to target prey.
And just a cavernous mouth on this thing.
It just inhales its food fish whole.
I've got to let this fish recover before I let it go
and that means exposing myself
to a potential croc attack.
But out here in the middle of the river,
it's my only option.
What I want now is one that weighs...
..maybe three times that.
Encouraged by my success
and aware there could be
even bigger monsters on the prowl,
I decide to head downstream for my next cast,
as the commotion of that catch
could have spooked everything close by.
But as I'm travelling,
I see a heavily fortified barrier in the water
that confirms that crocs
are a very real problem here.
- This is protection from something in the water?
- It is like a crocodile...
These villagers risk their lives
simply collecting their day's supply of water.
This is a serious barrier and it's pretty solid.
There's not much in the way of spaces
between there.
That is to stop crocodiles taking people
when they're collecting water.
So this is a very definite sign
the people here take them very seriously.
On this piece of river,
have people been killed by crocodiles?
Yeah.
It was a local fisherman who lost his life
and apparently this is not uncommon.
Nile crocodiles are thought to kill
hundreds of people every year,
making them responsible for more fatal attacks
on humans
than lions, bears and sharks combined.
Maybe I was a bit foolhardy
holding that fish in the water.
The locals certainly don't seem to be
taking any chances.
But it's not just creatures in the water
I have to look out for.
The weather is extreme
and can turn in a matter of minutes.
A bit of a storm can sometimes
get the fish stirred up, get them feeding.
But looking at all the lightning,
I'm not sure holding a conducting rod
up in the air in the middle of this
is a very good idea.
So if they don't feed,
it's not gonna be too much of a disappointment.
Storms in this part of the world
are sudden and brutal.
In 2008, 18 fishermen drowned
when their boat capsized in a storm
just a few hours away from here.
So I decide to bring in my line.
We've got torn away
from our mooring on the bank.
Soaked through!
If we're not careful,
we could become the next deathly statistic.
But as quickly as it started, the storm stops.
I'm just hoping it hasn't ruined my chances.
Trouble with rain is if it's heavy,
you just get all this rubbish coming off the land
and colouring the water
and if you're fishing for a sight predator
like the Nile Perch, you can forget it.
Luckily I've got a bit of a clear patch
next to the bank,
but it's colouring up as I speak.
You know, if more run-off comes from the land,
or if it rains more,
it could just put an end to the fishing for me.
(Reel unwinds)
Could this be the catch that proves
truly giant Nile Perch are still out there?
- That is definitely a fish.
- (Thunder rumbles)
The troubles is, over there,
there's a big storm coming in...
..with lightning coming down.
The storm seems to have swung back around
and this is exactly what I didn't want...
My carbon fiber rod in the air
like a lightning conductor,
as the wind picks up.
An incredible 10,000 people are killed
by lightning strikes worldwide every year
and Uganda is known for having
the highest frequency of thunder storms
anywhere in the world.
That's a catfish,
but looks to be quite a good size.
I've got to land this fish before the storm returns.
That's actually... OK, I was after a Nile Perch,
but that's a nice size catfish.
This one is, uh...a Semutundu catfish.
It's missing a bit of its tentacle here, but, uh...
..totally different from the Nile Perch.
Long body shape.
It's a predator, as well. You can see
the muscle blocks clear on the side.
Catfish are right at home in the muddy water,
with their strong sense of smell
and ability to sense movement in the murk.
It's probably not much of a surprise
I caught one of these rather than a Nile Perch.
Right. Get this back in the water very quickly,
then I think we've got to run for it.
(Thunder rumbles)
Oh!
I don't want to be caught in another lethal storm.
Besides, this river is rapidly turning to mud.
There's no way I’ll be catching a sight feeder
like the Nile Perch for at least a few days.
So I decide to head up the white Nile
to its source at Lake Victoria.
This is Lake Victoria, one of the biggest bodies
of freshwater anywhere in the world.
But it's also a place
where I hear they are still catching Nile Perch
in some quantity.
It seems like a calm and tranquil lake.
But my complacency is about to be rocked.
If I was in any doubt that I had come
to a dangerous region to fish,
then seeing the body of a fisherman
driven off in a makeshift ambulance
confirms that this
could be my most dangerous mission yet.
This just goes to show
just how regular accidents are
with the fishermen.
Just came down to the lake
and there's police here,
been called in because a body
has been recovered on the side of the lake.
It's quite hard to establish what happened,
but it sounds like this was a fisherman
who couldn't swim
and somehow ended up in the water.
This is a very big body of water.
It's like fishing the sea out here,
so in a way it's not surprising
and people go out in very flimsy boats.
Just another example of the dangers
and also how common accidents can be.
Maybe the fisherman got caught up in the storm
that I just avoided.
It's pretty sobering to see how little fuss
his death has caused.
But in this place,
it's a wonder any fisherman survives
the deadly predators or the raging waters.
And if I'm not careful, I could be the next body
they drag out of the water.
Despite the risks, I've got to stick to my goal.'
proving that there are still monster Mputa,
or Nile Perch, out here
and that I can survive catching them
where they live,
in the oldest and perhaps most dangerous
fishing region in the world.
I've come to Lake Victoria
in the African Rift Valley,
to prove that there are still monster Mputa,
or Nile Perch, out here.
However, in the late 1950s,
they were introduced,
to create an industry
for the surrounding countries.
And in just a few decades, they took over,
out-competing the native fish species
and reaching enormous sizes,
as they were without any real natural predators.
This fish was apparently 340Ibs.
But it was caught some five years ago
and the locals haven't seen anything
as big since.
However, with the lake covering
26,000 square miles,
there could still be some giants
that have stayed hidden.
This is an inlet of Lake Victoria.
Here they are actually catching Nile Perch
and not just a few.
It's serious, serious quantities.
This boat is just full of them.
Just one after another, after another.
But none of them are the giants that I'm after.
A quick chat reveals
that this ice boat collects the fish
netted by a fleet of
some 30 small fishing vessels.
This is fishing on an industrial scale.
This boat's been out for three days, apparently,
and there's three to four tonnes of fish in here.
That's a lot of fish.
I've been invited behind closed factory doors
to see the Nile Perch industry in action.
It provides thousands of jobs to the area
and it earns over $200m in revenue every year.
This is the reason truly giant Nile Perch
as so rare, these days.
So, apparently there's about 10-12 tonnes
of processed fish
leaving this factory every day,
which is, you know, a huge amount.
I mean, quite mind-boggling,
particularly when you consider
it's a freshwater fish.
Well, certainly impressive quantity of fish
coming out of the lake.
But one thing that really struck me is that the...
..the big ones
are just really few and far between.
Just trying to do a bit of the maths
and I reckon I'd have to plough through
something like 1 ,000 fish that size
to have even half a chance
of getting something half decent.
So I'm gonna have to try and find a place
where they don't have
such intensive commercial harvesting.
I decide to head further up the Rift Valley
to Ethiopia,
as the fishing there is far from industrial.
In fact, it's still conducted in much the same way
that it has been for tens of thousands of years.
And the Nile Perch
has always been the ultimate prize.
Ethiopia is one of the oldest and richest cultures
in the world.
This is the birthplace of mankind,
the home of Lucy, Ardi and many of
the so-called Missing Links.
But there are also traces of
the very first fishermen
here at the Ethiopian National Museum.
I've been allowed access
behind the scenes at the museum
and in this very room
are some of the oldest human remains
anywhere in the world.
But what I'm looking at at the moment
are some of the earliest ever fishing implements.
It's fairly clear that these were used for fish,
because in the same place
were found remains of fish.
They found a skull there,
just the skull was 3ft long,
so the whole fish...
7ft, 8ft, something like that.
So, whoever was using
these harpoons here
could have been after
some fairly interesting fish back then.
I'm overwhelmed to be this close
to the earliest tools of my trade.
It turns out that this skull belonged to
a giant Mputa, or Nile Perch.
It looks like this modern-day monster
has been a valued prize for thousands of years.
The ancient Egyptians revered Nile Perch
for the amount of food they could provide.
They even mummified these sacred fish
and entombed them with their dead.
It's no wonder there's a huge industry
harvesting these fish today.
But if I want to catch one,
then I need to head to the spots
that are hardest to reach,
where the fishing is so dangerous,
the locals won't even attempt it.
Maybe here's where I’ll find my giant.
These are the headwaters
of the BIue Nile in Ethiopia.
From here, this water
will go a couple of thousand miles,
all the way to the Mediterranean.
There are two main branches of the Nile river.
I started my search on the Ugandan white Nile,
but this is the BIue Nile
and Nile Perch are found along its entire length.
These falls are known locally as Tis Isat,
which translates as ''The water That Smokes''.
The mist has made these rocks
incredibly slippery.
If I fall into this swirling water,
I could be swept downstream
too fast to be rescued.
There's definitely no commercial fishing here,
so maybe at these falls I’ll catch my monster.
There's a fish!
There is a... Oh, it's off!
That was a fish. That was a...
..a knock, then a tighten,
then I felt something on there.
I’ll just wind it up and see.
I can't actually see any signs there,
tooth marks, or anything like that.
But there was definitely something on there.
I think I should lob that out again, ASAP.
I continue fishing for another few hours,
but whatever that was lurking in this pool,
it seems to have been spooked.
And it didn't feel like the giant I'm after,
so I decide to move on.
I head south, to another lake,
as I hear big Mputa
are the villagers' target species.
Fishing techniques here
have remained pretty much the same
for thousands of years.
Maybe if I leave my hi-tech equipment behind
for now
and join these fishermen, they’ll share
their secrets of where they catch their fish.
This is Lake Chamo in Africa's Rift Valley.
Just looking around today,
even in the 21 st Century,
this place has the look of somewhere
that could hold a real serious monster.
Lake Chamo is in the south of
the Ethiopian Rift Valley
and it is known for the size of the beasts
that live here.
And these beasts aren't just fish.
I generally scout out an area before I fish.
But on this lakeside, I'm not alone,
and I'm not sure I like it.
I'm not used to jostling for position
with man-eaters.
These guys can eat up to
half their own body weight in a single meal
and very often
it's fishermen that end up on the menu.
It's situations like this that make you rethink
your place on the food chain.
I'm normally the person doing the hunting,
but I'm very aware now that I'm having
to look around, watch my back,
something might have its eye on me.
I'm feeling a little bit more relaxed now.
(Rustling)
There's crocs still in some of these reeds here.
Didn't actually see the animal,
but heard the movement
as it went through the reeds.
It seems like the big Nile Perch
are only going to be found
where the dangers are high.
I'm hoping to get some survival advice
from a group of fishermen
camped out on the lake's shore.
(Speaks local language)
So why is it off the ground?
Why have you got it raised up off the ground?
(Speaks local language)
One reason it's off the ground
is just to keep them dry,
but there's also just a real menagerie of animals
that's active at night.
They say even pythons will come
and snuggle up to you
if you're lying  on the ground.
Just last year,
a man was nearly killed by a 13ft python.
He only escaped by using his cellphone
to raise the alarm.
So you actually live here all the year round?
It very much is, you know,
a very hardcore way of life, this.
It is set apart from the rest of society.
But I think quite a few people here
have got rather shady pasts
and they can't really go back.
So that explains why they do live on the edges,
this very basic existence
and putting up with the very real dangers
that go with this way of life.
It's a fairly lawless society down here,
by all accounts
and I'm not exactly comfortable
in their presence.
Apparently some of these men
are wanted by the police
for crimes that include murder.
This man tells me that not long ago
he was out fishing with a friend
when he was attacked by a rival gang.
Conflict like this
has been going on for centuries.
(Shouting)
They stole his nets and boats
and apparently he was lucky to escape alive.
The dangers here
come at you from all directions.
I'm honoured, but a little uneasy,
when these fishermen on the fringe
invite me to join their meal.
So, is this tilapia?
Tilapia?
Little bit of spice.
Tilapia are a small fish
that they commonly target,
as they are easier to catch than the Nile Perch.
Ah!
(Clears throat) Very good! Sushi tilapia.
Actually not bad. Mm! Thank you.
I realise that if I'm to fish here,
I really need to know the risks I’ll be facing.
What about the dangers on the lake?
I've seen the hippos, I've seen the crocodiles.
Is this something that you worry about
every day?
(Speaks local language)
Most of these animals,
the hippos and the crocs,
will be close to the shore.
That's the dangerous area.
So what they do, they deploy their nets
out in the middle of the lake,
in the deeper water,
but they've still got to go through the shallows
on their way and on their way back.
But they say, even so,
there are people
who've worked with them in the past,
who have been killed
by both hippos and by crocs.
Despite their lumbering looks,
many consider hippos
Africa's most dangerous animal,
as they often kill fishermen.
This man knows just how real that danger is.
He was attacked by a hippo
just a few months ago,
while on his way to the lake
to fish for Nile Perch.
(Speaks local language)
He was walking with nets along a path
and then he noticed a hippo.
when he saw the hippo, he called out
and his friend ran off.
At that point, the hippo charged him.
The next thing that happens
is that the hippo is goring him
in the side of the chest.
(Screaming)
The hippo has these
two sharp tusks on the lower jaw.
Apparently it was spearing him with these tusks
and in the process of that,
flipped him over onto his back.
He basically just thought he was going to die
and he was praying for it to stop,
praying that he would survive somehow.
(Speaks local language)
It appeared that his prayers had been
answered,
because the hippo stopped goring him
and started moving off towards the lake,
towards the water.
Shortly after that,
his friend came back and found him.
what injuries were you left with after this?
Can you show your...?
This horrific wound on the chest here -
apparently there were three ribs broken,
with bits of rib actually visible, sticking out.
Likewise, the wounds on the leg -
there was a flap of skin hanging out.
For me, it just really underlines
just what a dangerous job this is,
what a dangerous place this is
to be a fisherman. I mean, I...
can scarcely begin to imagine what it's like
working as a fisherman on this lake.
But if I want to learn how they catch the Mputa,
I'm going to have to fish like they do.
So I head out with one of the guys
to check their nets.
But I hadn't counted on their boats
being so flimsy and exposed.
This is a bit nerve-wracking.
There's a pod of hippos over there.
It's not them I'm worried about,
but there's a couple of others
on the fringes of the group
which periodically go under,
then come back up again
and they've been coming back up
closer and closer.
I'm trying to get to the deep water,
cos that's gonna be safer
than the shallows
where the hippos and crocs are.
Hippos very, very close,
looking this way, going underwater.
I don't like the look of this, actually.
After what I've just heard,
I want to stay well clear of these hippos.
They are just as dangerous in the water
and they have been known to flip boats,
chomping the occupants to death.
If I get on the wrong side of a hippo,
especially in this tiny canoe,
I’ll be lucky to escape alive.
But my only option is to just get on with it.
If, like the local fishermen, you are dependent
on the fish you catch to stay alive,
you've got to work with the dangers.
Bit of a ropey old net, this.
Looks like a few crocs and hippos
have actually gone through this.
It's good having something to do
while I'm out here, rather than just drifting.
The thought of what's down there -
the crocs and the hippos down there.
Oh, there's a fish already.
So this is a tilapia.
This is what the fishermen mostly catch -
what they catch in numbers in these lakes.
And they don't run to a great deal bigger
than this.
Spiny dorsal fin,
lovely blue-ish colouration there.
Yeah, just very pretty.
But the reason they're catching them
is they are very, very good eating,
which is what's gonna happen to this one.
The rest of the net doesn't yield any more fish,
let alone a Nile Perch.
But apparently they are out there
and they are the prize that makes
facing the unseen dangers worthwhile.
The fishermen on this lake are proving to be
some of the bravest people I've met.
However, in his pursuit of fish,
this guy has pushed his luck to the limit.
(Speaks local language)
This is actually quite a story.
He'd earlier seen a crocodile in this area
and what he'd done,
he'd thrown stones at the crocodile
to make it go away.
He just saw the crocodile sink.
He assumed, then,
that it was safe to go in the water.
(Screams)
That crocodile grabbed him by the left leg.
What crocodiles do,
they try and pull you into deeper water
to drown you.
That's how they kill you,
before they then dismember you later on.
(Speaks local language)
But the crocodile actually
then got tangled in the net.
And the fisherman was able to actually
come free of the crocodile's jaws.
But you said there were two times?
Another time, also, a crocodile attack?
The second time was two years later.
Deploying the net
and as he's paying out the net,
he felt something go like that on his toe.
This was a crocodile standing on his right foot.
At that point, he's thinking, ''Here we go again.''
He managed to half get on the boat,
right leg on the boat,
and then the crocodile came along
and grabbed his left leg again.
One tooth of the crocodile went in his leg.
Because the boat was in the way,
the crocodile couldn't get a good grip on him.
So eventually the crocodile's grip slipped
and he was able to escape.
I'm thinking this is a very lucky guy.
He probably doesn't feel he's lucky
to have this happen twice
but the fact he's escaped twice
from the jaws of crocodiles,
that is absolutely impressive for anybody.
I'm really glad I don't have to earn my living
fishing from this lake.
And the one that attacked you,
same size as this?
I reckon that croc must be about 15ft long
and close to 1,000Ibs.
Fishermen here have a lot to be afraid of,
so it's no wonder that religion
plays such an important part in their lives.
This spectacular rock-hewn church is devoted to
the patron saint of Ethiopia,
a man famous for doing battle
with an almighty river monster,
a giant dragon.
This is Bete Giyorgis, the Church of St George.
This place literally is breathtaking.
To think this is
actually just one solid lump of rock, I mean...
It's just a huge sculpture, really. Just incredible.
This is a classic picture of St George
on his horse.
The dragon Lying  dead, or dying,
on the ground.
(Speaks local language)
It's very, very clear from here,
that so important is he to the people here,
that there are even people who believe
that this story of George and the dragon
actually happened here in Ethiopia.
If St George did kill
a dangerous Ethiopian dragon,
then it's no wonder the locals revere him.
But as I walk through the nearby town,
I realise just how significant he is to them.
St George is so important here in Ethiopia
that the 23rd of every month is St George's Day.
And here,
at another church devoted to St George,
you get these crowds of people
coming in to worship.
As I wait for the mass to finish,
a man seemingly kitted out
as St George himself arrives.
(Speaks local language)
I've just asked this man, is he St George?
He's launched into the whole story,
telling me the story of St George.
(Speaks local language)
Apparently, at some point in the distant past,
human sacrifices were made
to appease a dangerous dragon
that lived in a lake near a village.
(Screams)
Eventually,
it was the turn of the chief's daughter.
But before she was devoured,
a knight arrived to slay the dragon
and save the princess.
This man was St George.
(Speaks local language)
As the St George's Day mass finishes,
I enter the church to see if I can learn a bit more
about what kind of local river monster
this dragon might have been.
Well, this is the classic picture of St George
on his horse.
Dragon...slain on the ground.
And the princess, the maiden, looking on.
Very, very detailed rendition of the dragon.
It's got pretty nasty-looking teeth,
a forked tongue
and these wings with little claws,
almost, on the edge of the wings.
It seems like the dragon is a composite
of all the most deadly animals
that are found here
in the African Rift Valley.
Even my Nile Perch
is represented by the wings of this beast.
The continuing strength of this legend
underlines how the people here
have been battling creatures in the water
for generations
and they love a hero who can defeat them.
I come across one man who took on
perhaps the most feared animal here,
when he was attacked by a crocodile.
However, this time the croc
didn't leave empty-handed.
Not only did the crocodile make off with his foot,
it had done so much damage to his lower leg
that his leg was actually amputated
above the knee.
Unbelievably, he still fishes.
As this picture here proves,
he still goes out with just one leg,
fishing in the very same lake
where he had that encounter.
He has a family to feed,
so he has to keep facing the dangers.
But he's not fished this long
without learning a thing or two.
So this tilapia in the picture, very interesting.
He actually used that as live bait for Nile Perch.
He knows where the Nile Perch are,
he could tell me, possibly, the places to go
and maybe the places to avoid.
I think this could be a very useful lead.
After a discussion of tactics
with this fearless fisherman,
I head back out onto Lake Chamo,
armed with some inside information
about good places to try.
But to get to them, I have to pass a point
known as The Crocodile Market,
so-called because it's a favourite spot
for these lake giants to gather.
Apparently, the largest Nile crocodile
ever recorded
lived on this lake -
a beast about 20ft long.
And that was only a few years ago.
Seeing this many crocodiles
hauled out in the sun
makes me realise
just how many man-eating sized monsters
are living in this lake.
Just the size of some of these creatures -
just enormous.
I've never seen so many big crocodiles
in one place before.
And as they sink back into the water,
I can understand why they say
it's the croc you don't see that will kill you.
But for now, I've got a more immediate problem,
as again, out of nowhere,
the wind has suddenly picked up.
The waves have risen
and the water has muddied.
I think if ever there's a deadly place to fish,
either on rivers or in the sea,
this is it.
well, this boat is metal,
there's no inherent buoyancy at all.
If this develops a leak, it's going straight down
and there's 20ft crocs in here.
Only a prize as big as a Nile Perch
makes facing these risks worthwhile.
So I push on, hoping that I’ll catch my prey
before I become the prey.
Like the old man suggested,
I'm using a tilapia as bait.
It’ll work better than an artificial lure,
because the water's very cloudy.
But the weather here is beating me.
This is actually not working.
we're being blown so fast,
we're just dragging that behind us.
It's not actually drifting.
After a few hours getting bashed around
by the waves,
I head into shore for a break.
Basically, all the gear on both boats...
I've got two boats,
one for me, one for equipment and safety.
But everything just battered around and soaked.
So we've come into a bit of shelter here,
downwind of a peninsula
that runs out into the lake
and letting everything dry.
But we came past a net
and when we came onto the shore,
a couple of fishermen paddled round
in a boat with a sack
and, erm...I'm just gonna see what's in the sack,
actually.
Oh! I thought that might be a few in there -
that's just one fish.
It's a Nile Perch.
Not so easy to recognise when it's just the meat,
but actually, you can see the shape of the fish
from this fillet.
Very deep bodied.
white flesh, some red muscle on the outside,
but very prized for its eating.
Looking at that,
the tail is going to end about here,
the head is about here,
which translates into a fish
that's sort of 3ft-4ft long.
So I'm guessing that's gonna be a good 50Ibs,
something like that.
Do you catch on a hook, or nets?
(Speaks local language)
So, fairly industrial fishing methods.
About 70-80 yard long net
and going down about 6-7ft.
So that was put out last night,
they checked it today and this was the result.
One fish, but a very nice sized one.
(Speaks local language)
Apparently this was caught
from an area near here,
where the bottom is quite rocky.
That's quite a good sign,
because everywhere I've been to so far,
the bottom has been very smooth, very level.
It's interesting that this fish was caught
in a place where there's a little bit of
underwater ups and downs.
I try my luck at the spot they mentioned,
a rocky outcrop in the lee of an island.
Nile Perch love having cover to ambush
their prey from
and the underwater ridge here
could be perfect for them.
But, despite fishing here for several hours,
nothing takes.
Over the next few days,
I fish a variety of locations,
but it just seems that either the fish aren't here,
or others have gotten here first.
So this net
is definitely designed to catch Nile Perch.
Looks like
I've got some serious competition here.
Eventually, I have to admit
that this lake is defeating me.
I've seen how determined
the fishermen are here
and they've been harvesting these lakes
for thousands of years.
I'm beginning to wonder if the Nile Perch here
have been over-fished, too.
It's disappointing having to leave these lakes
without having caught anything.
I've seen plenty of monsters,
but not the one I want.
If I stayed long enough, I might catch something,
but life is too short for that.
I think I'm gonna have to go to
one of the other Rift Valley lakes.
I have no choice but to head to a place
that is truly out of reach of fishermen.
Not only is it illegal to keep fish
that are caught here,
but few local fishermen are willing to test
its spectacular natural defences.
This is Murchison Falls in Uganda.
I've seen how people in the Rift Valley
fish some pretty extreme,
dangerous water conditions,
but I can't imagine anybody fishing here.
So I'm thinking that maybe
at the bottom of these falls
could be the place where
I'm gonna catch my monster Nile Perch.
The water at the bottom of these falls
is known as The Devil's Cauldron
and it's where
I'm about to meet my river monster.
On this journey to catch
Africa's largest freshwater fish,
I've faced deadly monsters,
encountered fearless fishermen
who have courted death,
and I've braved storms and lethal conditions
in what is surely one of the most deadly places
in the world to be a fisherman.
(Shouting)
Yet the giant at its heart has so far eluded me.
As I make my way up to the falls,
my anticipation is mounting.
I'm just approaching
what looks like smoke there,
but that is the spray that is being thrown up
by the Murchison Falls.
The thought of the size of some of the fish
that are down in this churning water,
you know, starting to get a bit of a flutter.
It's really quite frightening,
the thought of hooking a big fish in this water.
This could be my best and perhaps
last chance of catching a monster.
This big eddy behind me
is called The Devil's Cauldron.
Now, that sounds very melodramatic,
very over the top,
but words almost don't do justice to this place.
when you're down at water level, you know,
just a huge push of water coming through.
Apparently 300 tonnes every second
coming through that crack there.
This is very hostile water.
For the local fishermen, with their methods,
it's not gonna be easy to fish here.
If you're fishing nets, or long lines,
that kind of fishing involves
getting in the water often.
There are crocs in here,
this water is very strong.
So this could be the only kind of gear
that might stand a chance here.
I've got to watch my footing.
If I fall in, I’ll be sucked to the bottom of
this churning water in seconds.
Crocs are hard to see in the water
at the best of times,
but the foam produced by the falls
gives them the perfect cover.
This could be my most dangerous
fishing location yet.
Anything takes that bait - it's a large bait -
it's gonna be a serious size fish.
So, one thing I've got to really be aware of
is I don't want to be pulled in here.
Oh! Fish on!
went a bit slack then,
but the water's moving around so much,
it's gone in some of the water
that's coming towards me.
It feels a good size,
because it's actually coming with the current.
It's coming up to the surface.
Coming up to the surface!
That's a good size fish.
Gosh, that's a good size.
It's actually going with the current.
It's just stopped.
There it is on the top. On the top, on the top!
I think the fish is tired,
but there's a real weight of water behind it.
It's right in the side here! It's right in the side!
Right in the side.
It's tired out.
I can't see the fish, cos there's all that foam.
How about that? How about that?!
Right. I've just put a bit of heavy mono
through its mouth.
what I'm gonna do - pull it back into the water,
walk it round here into some quiet water,
where it can recover.
where I can recover, as well.
I'm just hoping if there's crocs,
they’ll prefer the fish to me.
It's already starting to get
a bit more strength back,
but I want to make sure it's fully recovered
before I have a look.
If it goes back in this water
not properly recovered,
it's just gonna get bashed,
possibly to death, on these rocks.
I'm gonna need the help of my boat driver,
as this fish is too big to lift by myself.
It's 120Ibs with the net -
we've got to deduct a little bit for that -
but that's well clear of 100Ibs.
OK. And then up.
OK. Right.
This is one lump of a Nile Perch.
Well over 100Ibs
and what an amazing setting to catch it from.
Big old fish, ambush predator,
great big paddle of a tail there.
But at the business end, look at this -
you don't have tentacles like a catfish,
you've got big eyes,
then you've got this protrusible jaw.
when it actually opens that quickly,
it's almost telescopic
and it just engulfs fish by creating a vacuum -
the water just rushes in.
And one other thing just to say -
look at that for a defence.
It's like having six-inch nails
sticking out your back.
Finally, I've caught the fish
that shows monster Nile Perch
can still be found here in Africa's Rift Valley.
Nice to see it go back.
Oh! Tell you what, though, if I was a fish,
I would not like to live in this water.
Some of the other stuff in here,
particularly the crocodiles,
also the sheer strength of this water.
But what a dramatic setting
to catch a fish like that.
On this journey, I've had to fish
some of the scariest places I've ever been to.
But I've put my life on the line,
faced the monsters
and caught a giant
in what is almost certainly
the oldest and most dangerous
fishing spot in the world.","The Nile perch (Lates niloticus), also known as the African snook, Goliath perch, African barramundi, Goliath barramundi, Giant lates or the Victoria perch, is a species of freshwater fish in family Latidae of order Perciformes. It is widespread throughout much of the Afrotropical realm, being native to the Congo, Nile, Senegal, Niger and Lake Chad, Volta, Lake Turkana, and other river basins. It also occurs in the brackish waters of Lake Maryut in Egypt. The Nile perch is a fish of substantial economic and food-security importance in East Africa. Originally described as Labrus niloticus, among the marine wrasses, the species has also been referred to as Centropomus niloticus. Common names include African snook, Victoria perch (a misleading trade name, as the species is not native to Lake Victoria, though they have been introduced there), and many local names in various African languages, such as the Luo name mbuta or mputa. In Tanzania, it is called sangara, sankara, or chenku. In Francophone African countries, it is known as capitaine. Its name in the Hausa language is giwan ruwa, meaning ""water elephant"".


== Description ==
L. niloticus is silver in color with a blue tinge. It has distinctive dark-black eyes, with a bright-yellow outer ring. One of the largest freshwater fishes, it reaches a maximum length of nearly 2 m (6 ft 7 in), weighing up to 200 kg (440 lb). Mature fish typically range from 1.21–1.37 m (4 ft 0 in – 4 ft 6 in), although many fish are caught before they can grow this large.

Adult Nile perch occupy all habitats of a lake with sufficient oxygen concentrations, while juveniles are restricted to shallow or nearshore environments. A fierce predator that dominates its surroundings, the Nile perch feeds on fish (including its own species), crustaceans, molluscs, and insects; the juveniles also feed on zooplankton. Nile perch use schooling as a mechanism to protect themselves from other predators.


== Invasive species ==
Nile perch have been introduced to many other lakes in Africa, including Lake Victoria   and the artificial Lake Nasser. The World Conservation Union's Invasive Species Specialist Group considers L. niloticus one of the world's 100 worst invasive species.
The state of Queensland in Australia levies heavy fines on anyone found in possession of a living Nile perch, since it competes directly with the native barramundi, which is similar and grows to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) long, while the Nile perch grows to 2.0 m (6 ft 7 in) long.
The species is of great commercial importance as a food fish. The Nile perch is also popular with sport anglers, as it attacks artificial fishing lures, and it is also raised in aquaculture.


=== Lake Victoria introduction ===

The introduction of this species to Lake Victoria is one of the most cited examples of the negative effects alien species can have on ecosystems.
The Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria in East Africa in the 1950s, and has since been fished commercially. In 2003, Nile perch sales to the EU reached 169 million euros. Sport-fishing in the region of Uganda and Tanzania provided additional income from tourism.
Its introduction was ecologically disruptive and is attributed with causing the extinction or near-extinction of several hundred native species, with some populations fluctuating with commercial fishing and the actual Nile perch stocks. The Nile perch initially fed on native cichlids, but with decreasing availability of this prey, it now consumes mainly small shrimp and minnows.
The alteration of the native ecosystem had disruptive socioeconomic effects on local communities bordering the lake. Many local people have been displaced from their traditional occupations in the fishing trade and brought them into the cash economy, or before the establishment of export-oriented fisheries, turned them into economic refugees. At least initially, nets strong enough to hold adult Nile perch could not be manufactured locally and had to be imported for a high price.
The introduction of Nile perch has also had additional ecological effects on shore. Native cichlids were traditionally sun-dried, but because Nile perch have a high fat content (higher than cichlids), they need to be smoked to avoid spoiling. This has led to an increased demand for firewood in a region already hard-hit by deforestation, soil erosion, and desertification.
The Academy Award-nominated documentary Darwin's Nightmare by Hubert Sauper (a French-Austrian-Belgian production, 2004) deals with the damage that has been caused by Nile perch introduction, including the import of weapons and ammunition in cargo planes from Europe, which are then used to export Nile perch, further exacerbating conflict and misery in the surrounding regions.
Regardless of whether it is considered positive or negative, the trophic web of Lake Victoria appears to have been drastically impoverished by the introduction of this novel near-top-level predator. While the ecosystem seems to be moving towards a new equilibrium, neither its former state nor the state of fisheries on Lake Victoria can ever easily be brought back.


== Threats ==
Despite being a successful invasive species, the fish faces threats. Being a species of megafauna, the most obvious threats to the species are overfishing and the use of illegal fishing gear, as well as invasive water hyacinths. Prey depletion is also a factor, as it decreases the size of the fish and makes it vulnerable to larger predators, such as crocodiles.


== Export ==
In 2021, The Uganda Fish Processors and Exporters Association called on the parliament to ban the local consumption of the species so as to protect its export.


== Religion ==
Nile perch were involved with the worship of Neith. As a result nile perch were sometimes mummified. A deposit of several thousand mummified perch was excavated in an area to the west of Esna where there was a temple to  Neith. Mummified perch have also been found at Gurob  near a temple to  Neith while perch statuettes have been found at Sais again in the context of a temple to Neith.

Piranha,Red Bellied Piranha,Pygocentrus nattereri,"PIRANHA.
LEGENDS TELL OF THE MOST
FEROCIOUS FISH IN WORLD.
WITH RAZOR-SHARP TEETH,
THEY HUNT IN PACKS,
STRIPPING A BODY OF ITS FLESH
IN MINUTES.
THEY HAVE A REPUTATION
FOR KILLING AND EATING HUMANS.
LITERALLY BEING STRIPPED
OF ALL THE FLESH.
ONLY THE BOOTS WERE LEFT.
BUT IT MAY NOT BE JUSTIFIED.
I DON'T THINK
THE REPUTATION OF PIRANHAS
AS BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS
IS DESERVED AT ALL.
I'M JEREMY WADE,
BIOLOGIST AND EXTREME ANGLER.
AND MY MISSION IS TO FIND OUT
IF PIRANHAS REALLY ARE
THE ULTIMATE HORROR
OF THE AMAZON.
ALL THEY SAID THAT THEY SAW WAS
JUST A TURBULENCE IN THE WATER
OF THE PIRANHAS
DEVOURING THE CHILD.
I REMEMBER A STORY FROM THE '70s OF A BUS
CRASHING INTO THE AMAZON RIVER IN BRAZIL.
THE PEOPLE INSIDE
WERE EATEN ALIVE BY PIRANHAS.
HORRIFIC STORIES LIKE THIS
HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING
SINCE THE DISCOVERY
OF SOUTH AMERICA.
BUT EVERY SINGLE PIECE
OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH I FOUND
SAYS THAT PIRANHAS
DON'T KILL PEOPLE.
SO ARE THESE STORIES REAL, OR ARE THEY
JUST OVEREXAGGERATED URBAN MYTHS?
FISH ON. FISH ON.
I'VE TRAVELED THE GLOBE LITERALLY
PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE
TO PROVE THAT THERE ARE GIANT MAN-EATING
FISH WHERE NO ONE WOULD EXPECT THEM...
BIG OLD MOUTH ON THERE.
IN OUR FRESHWATER RIVERS.
BUT NOW IT'S THE TURN
OF THE SMALL GUYS.
COULD PIRANHAS REALLY
KILL AND EAT A HUMAN?
ARE THEY THE BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS FROM
THE MOVIES THAT FILL OUR NIGHTMARES?
I VISITED LONDON ZOO
TO TALK TO BRIAN ZIMMERMAN,
A PIRANHA EXPERT AND ASSISTANT CURATOR
OF THE AQUARIUM, TO SEE WHAT HE THINKS.
THERE'S NO DOCUMENTED CASES
OF A LIVING HUMAN
GOING INTO THE WATER AND BEING
ATTACKED BY A GROUP OF PIRANHAS
AND BEING REDUCED TO A SKELETON
IN SECONDS.
BUT PIRANHA
ARE CARNIVOROUS FISH.
IF THEY'RE HUNGRY, IT'S CERTAINLY
POSSIBLE THAT THEY WOULD ATTACK
TO TRY TO GET FOOD.
I DON'T SEE WHY A HUMAN WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT
THAN AN EGRET FALLING IN THE WATER.
IT'S JUST... FOR A PIRANHA,
IT'S A POTENTIAL FOOD SOURCE.
BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED.
SO IF BRIAN BELIEVES PIRANHAS HAVE NEVER
ATTACKED AND KILLED A LIVING PERSON,
THEN DID THIS BUS CRASH THAT
I REMEMBER REALLY TAKE PLACE?
I DECIDE TO HEAD TO MANAUS, THE
CITY AT THE HEART OF THE AMAZON,
TO SEE IF I CAN GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS MEMORY
AND MAYBE TRACK DOWN A DEFINITE CASE
WHERE PIRANHAS HAVE EATEN SOMEONE ALIVE.
AND WHERE BETTER
TO START MY INVESTIGATION
THAN THE HOME OF MANY A GRUESOME FISHERMEN'S
TALE... THE MANAUS FISH MARKET.
WITH OVER 2,000 SPECIES OF FISH
FOUND IN THE AMAZON RIVER...
MORE THAN THE ENTIRE ATLANTIC OCEAN...
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE
OF STRANGE-LOOKING
RIVER MONSTERS HERE.
WICKED-LOOKING SPINES ON THERE.
SUCH A VARIETY OF FISH HERE.
SCIENTISTS HAVE DETERMINED
THAT THERE ARE
SOME 60 DIFFERENT SPECIES
IN THE PIRANHA SUBFAMILY.
YET THE MAJORITY OF THEM
ARE ACTUALLY VEGETARIAN.
IT IS THE FLESH-EATING BEHAVIOR
OF JUST A COUPLE OF SPECIES
THAT GIVES THEM
THEIR REPUTATION.
AND IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE MY QUESTIONS
UNEARTH ANOTHER SHOCKING ACCOUNT
THAT SHOWS JUST WHAT
THEY ARE CAPABLE OF.
THIS IS A PIRANHA STORY.
AND OLD MAN WAS LEFT IN HIS FLOATING HOUSE
BY HIS FAMILY JUST FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
THEY CAME BACK, HE'D GONE.
THERE WERE
JUST HIS CLOTHES THERE.
SO, YOU KNOW, THEY THOUGHT HE
MUST HAVE GONE TO TAKE A BATH
OR SOMETHING,
BUT HE WASN'T IN SIGHT ANYWHERE.
THEY SEARCHED, THEY SEARCHED.
EVENTUALLY,
THEY FOUND JUST HIS SKELETON.
I MEAN, LITERALLY...
HE'D GONE IN THE WATER.
BECAUSE HE WAS OLD, HE WASN'T ABLE TO GET
BACK OUT, AND THE PIRANHAS JUST HAD HIM.
TWO MONTHS AGO.
IT'S ANOTHER GRUESOME STORY.
BUT HERE AT THE MARKET, I CAN'T TRACK
DOWN A NAME OR DEFINITE LOCATION
FOR THIS FISHERMAN'S TALE.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEARCH
FURTHER AFIELD
TO FIND AN EYEWITNESS
TO A LETHAL PIRANHA ATTACK.
THE AMAZON RIVER IS 4,250 MILES LONG,
TWICE THE LENGTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI.
IT IS MOSTLY WIDE
AND SLOW-MOVING,
BUT UP THIS DISTANT TRIBUTARY,
IT IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
1/5 OF ALL THE WATER ON EARTH
PASSES THROUGH THE AMAZON,
AND PIRANHAS AND THEIR RELATIVES
ARE FOUND IN JUST ABOUT ALL OF IT.
IT'S A FISHERMAN'S PARADISE.
AND IT'S FULL
OF RIVER MONSTERS.
AND THERE'S A FISH ON.
THERE'S A FISH ON.
OH, THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS
JUMPING OUT OF THE WATER.
THAT'S QUITE STRONG.
THAT'S A STRONG FISH.
I'VE HOOKED A PREDATORY FISH WITH DENTAL
HARDWARE STRAIGHT OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE.
SO THIS IS A PAYARA.
IT'S A RELATIVE OF THE PIRANHA.
IT IS AN ARMS WAR DOWN THERE.
EVERYTHING'S GOT TEETH.
EVERYTHING IS EATING
EVERYTHING ELSE.
AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY GOT THOSE
FANGS THERE IN THE LOWER JAW.
AND THEY USE THOSE TO PUNCTURE
THE SWIM BLADDER OF THE PREY,
SO IT JUST MESSES UP
THE BUOYANCY.
THE SMALL FISH
IS THEN TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.
IT'S FLOPPING AROUND
NEAR THE SURFACE,
AND THESE WILL JUST COME ALONG
AFTERWARDS AND MOP THEM UP.
AND THOSE FANGS ARE THAT BIG THAT IT HAS
TO HAVE SPECIAL HOLES IN THE UPPER JAW.
OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO GET ITS MOUTH CLOSED.
SO IT'S PROBABLY
SOME VERY PRECISE ENGINEERING
GOING ON OUT OF SIGHT
THAT WE CAN'T SEE.
THIS VAMPIRE-LIKE CREATURE SHOWS HOW
EVIL-LOOKING THE PIRANHA FAMILY CAN GET.
BUT DESPITE ITS LOOKS, IT IS NOT THE
FISH RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTACKING PEOPLE.
THIS IS A SOLITARY FISH HUNTER.
THE PIRANHA WE ALL FEAR
FEED IN PACKS.
AND THEY ARE SO COMMON IN THE AMAZON
YOU CAN CATCH THEM ALMOST ANYWHERE.
NORMALLY, I USE HIGH-TECH GEAR AND STEALTHY
TACTICS TO LURE A MONSTER ONTO MY LINE.
BUT THE PIRANHA'S METHOD OF FEEDING IS
SO BOLD THAT I'M CHANGING MY APPROACH.
I'VE DISPENSED
WITH MY NORMAL ROD.
AND I'M JUST USING A BIT OF BAMBOO WITH
A SHORT LENGTH OF LINE ON THE END.
TRIED-AND-TESTED MEANS
OF CATCHING PIRANHA.
JUST A HOOK ON THE END
WITH A PIECE OF WIRE
SO THEY I DON'T CHOMP THROUGH
THE LINE, LUMP OF MEAT.
AND UNLIKE OTHER TECHNIQUES WHERE
YOU'RE BEING QUIET AND STEALTHY,
PIRANHAS ARE ACTUALLY ATTRACTED BY
NOISE AND DISTURBANCE ON THE SURFACE.
OH. THERE WE GO.
RED-BELLIED PIRANHA.
IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
I'VE CAUGHT A SMALL PIRANHA.
BUT DO NOT BE DECEIVED.
IT STILL HAS KNIFE-LIKE TEETH
THAT CAN EASILY REMOVE A LUMP
OF FLESH IN A SINGLE BITE.
MULTIPLY THAT BY THE HUNDRED OR SO
MOUTHS IN A HUNGRY SCHOOL OF PIRANHAS
AND IT'S A DEATH
OF A THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL CUTS.
A PROTRUDING JAWBONE
WITH LARGE CHOMPING MUSCLES
MEANS THAT WHEN THE MOUTH IS CLOSED,
THE TRIANGULAR TEETH FROM BOTH JAWS
LOCK TOGETHER LIKE A BEAR TRAP.
THEY ARE PERFECTLY ADAPTED TO SLICE
OFF PIECES OF MEAT, FINS, OR SCALES,
LITERALLY TAKING APART
THEIR PREY PIECE BY PIECE.
THEY PREDOMINANTLY HUNT FISH, BUT THEY
WILL EAT THE MEAT OF ALMOST ANY ANIMAL
THAT CROSSES THEIR PATH.
AND IN THIS RIVER, WITH ALMOST
EVERY CAST I'M CATCHING A PIRANHA.
THIS RIVER IS JUST
ABSOLUTELY FULL OF PIRANHAS.
THEY'RE JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE.
DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY, THOUGH,
THAT I CAN'T DO THIS.
SURELY SWIMMING IN A
PIRANHA-INFESTED RIVER IS SUICIDE.
THIS WATER MAY BE FULL OF PIRANHAS,
BUT THEY'RE NOT ATTACKING ME.
IF I CAN SWIM HERE AND IT'S TRUE THAT
THE OLD MAN FROM THE FISH-MARKET STORY
AND THE VICTIMS OF THE BUS CRASH WERE
EATEN ALIVE, THEN SOMETHING IS MISSING
THAT IS NEEDED TO TRIGGER
A FEEDING FRENZY.
STILL ALIVE.
THERE'S PLENTY OF WATER HERE.
I'M GUESSING THERE'S ENOUGH
FOOD FOR THEM DOWN THERE
WITHOUT THEM
WANTING TO ATTACK ME.
SO WHAT ABOUT IF I SET SOMETHING UP WHERE
I KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF PIRANHAS
AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE HUNGRY?
WELCOME TO MY PIRANHA POOL.
HERE AT A LOCAL HOTEL, JUST
LIKE MY FAVORITE BOND VILLAIN,
I'VE FILLED A SMALL SWIMMING POOL
WITH OVER 100 RED-BELLIED PIRANHAS,
AND THEY HAVEN'T EATEN
FOR DAYS.
IT'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO TEST
JUST HOW VORACIOUS THESE CREATURES ARE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT SHARKS
BEING BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS.
JUST WONDERING IF PIRANHAS HAVE THE
SAME KIND OF SENSITIVITY TO BLOOD.
PIRANHAS HAVE EVOLVED TO LIVE IN THE MURKY
SEDIMENT-FILLED WATERS OF THE AMAZON
WHERE VISIBILITY
IS OFTEN LESS THAN A FOOT,
SO A GOOD SENSE OF SMELL TO LOCATE
THEIR NEXT MEAL IS SURELY ESSENTIAL.
THAT'S DEFINITELY
GETTING A REACTION.
THERE'S A NUMBER OF FISH HAVE
COME INTO THAT CLOUD OF BLOOD,
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AROUND.
THEY WANT SOMETHING TO CHEW INTO, BUT
THERE'S NOTHING THERE AT THE MOMENT.
I THINK TIME TO PUT A BIT
OF FLESH IN THERE FOR THEM.
SO BLOOD IS DEFINITELY
WHETTING THEIR APPETITE.
AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN BLOOD
IN THE WATER
FROM THOSE INJURED BY
THE IMPACT OF THE BUS CRASH.
NOW, I WONDER HOW THESE PIRANHAS WILL
REACT TO A BLOODY PIECE OF PRIME STEAK.
THERE WE GO.
IT'S THE FIRST NIBBLE,
FIRST NIBBLE, FIRST NIBBLE.
AND THERE THEY ARE.
THEY'RE ALL PILING IN.
ONCE THE FIRST ONE STARTED,
THERE WE GO. ALL OVER.
PIRANHAS REACT TO THE SOUND
AND MOVEMENT
OF ANOTHER PIRANHA FEEDING,
ATTRACTING THEM TO THE SCENE
AND INCITING A FEEDING FRENZY.
AS SOON AS ONE PIRANHA
TAKES A BITE, IT MOVES AWAY,
ALLOWING A FAST TURNOVER OF FEEDERS
AND A RAPID SUCCESSION OF BITES.
IT'S NO WONDER THEY ARE KNOWN FOR STRIPPING
THEIR FOOD TO THE BONE IN JUST MINUTES.
THERE WE GO.
MEAT DEFINITELY WORKS.
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY MIGHT
REACT TO SOMETHING THAT'S ALIVE.
THESE PIRANHAS WERE TEARING INTO A PIECE
OF DEAD MEAT JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO,
BUT THEY ARE JUST NOT INTERESTED
IN ME.
SO, WHAT IS IT THAT TURNS PIRANHAS
INTO VICIOUS, MURDEROUS KILLERS?
THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO TRY
AND FIND OUT.
IF THE STORY OF THE BUS CRASH
IS TRUE,
THEN PRESUMABLY...
JUST LIKE MY PIRANHA POOL...
THERE WAS HUMAN FLESH, BLOOD,
AND A MASS OF HUNGRY PIRANHAS.
YET I AM UNHARMED.
TO PEOPLE ON THE BUS
WEREN'T SO LUCKY.
AS I CONTINUE MY INVESTIGATION,
I DISCOVER THE EVIDENCE
TO PROVE THAT THE BUS CRASH
DEFINITELY HAPPENED.
BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY,
I TRACKED DOWN A SURVIVOR
WHO HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE ESCAPE
ON THAT DAY.
MAYBE HE CAN GIVE ME THE DETAILS
OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
SO I CAN WORK OUT
WHAT TRIGGERS A PIRANHA ATTACK.
I'VE COME TO THE AMAZON
TO FIND OUT
IF PIRANHAS ARE THE
BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS OF MYTH
OR IF THE TRUTH
IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.
I'VE MANAGED TO UNEARTH A
NEWSPAPER REPORT FROM THE 1970s
THAT DESCRIBES THE EXACT
BUS CRASH THAT I REMEMBER
WHERE SOME OF THE PASSENGERS
WERE EATEN BY PIRANHAS.
IT REPORTS THAT ON THE 14th OF NOVEMBER,
1976, THE BUS WAS TRAVELING FROM MANAUS
TO THE TOWN OF ITACOATIARA, A
JOURNEY OF ABOUT FIVE HOURS.
AFTER DRIVING THROUGH THE NIGHT, IT
CRASHED INTO A TRIBUTARY OF THE AMAZON,
KILLING 39 PASSENGERS.
THE NEWSPAPER ALSO MENTIONS THE NAME
OF A SURVIVOR... DIRCEU ARAUJO.
I'VE MANAGED TO TRACK HIM DOWN
TO FIND OUT WHAT HE CAN
REMEMBER FROM THAT FATEFUL DAY,
AS THIS MIGHT ALLOW ME TO PASS JUDGMENT
ON THE GUILT OR OTHERWISE OF THE PIRANHA.
DIRCEU TELLS ME HE WAS SITTING
AT THE VERY REAR OF THE BUS,
AND LIKE THE REST OF THE PASSENGERS, HE HAD
BEEN SLEEPING FOR MOST OF THE JOURNEY.
ON BOARD THAT DAY WERE SEVERAL FAMILIES, A
COUPLE OF STUDENTS NAMED ALEX AND IVAN,
AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MEN AND WOMEN
RETURNING TO THEIR HOMES IN ITACOATIARA.
NOT LONG BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE BUS
WENT THROUGH A POTHOLE, WAKING DIRCEU UP.
THIS, HE TELLS ME,
COULD WELL HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE.
THIS IS THE VERY SPOT
WHERE THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.
THE BUS CAME DOWN HERE,
WENT IN THE RIVER DOWN THERE.
DIRCEU DOESN'T NOT KNOW IF THE
BRAKES FAILED OR IF THE BUS SKIDDED,
BUT THE DRIVER HAD DONE THE SAME
ROUTE SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY.
THE PAPERS AT THE TIME REPORTED THE
SUGGESTION THAT HE FELL ASLEEP
AND AT THE FERRY CROSSING CARRIED
STRAIGHT ON INTO THE RIVER.
ONE MINUTE
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.
LITERALLY THE NEXT MOMENT,
IT'S IN THE WATER.
THERE WERE PEOPLE CRYING,
WAILING, MUCH DESPAIR.
THERE WERE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT TRYING
TO OPEN THE DOOR BY PULLING IT.
HE'S BASICALLY SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW,
THAT DOOR ONLY OPENS IF YOU PUSH.
THEN THE WATER...
THE WATER STARTED TO COME IN,
AT WHICH POINT HE WENT BACK
TO WHERE HE'D BEEN SEATED.
THERE WAS A BOY THERE WHO'D BEEN
TRYING TO BREAK THE WINDOW,
AND HE SAW ACTUALLY SAW... DIRCEU SAW THIS
BOY'S FOOT DISAPPEARING OUT OF THE BUS,
AND HE SAW THE FOOT, FOLLOWED IT, MANAGED
TO GET HIMSELF OUT THROUGH THE SAME HOLE.
HE'S JUST ABOUT
CLEAR OF THE BUS.
SOMEBODY GRABBED HOLD
OF HIS LEG. CAN YOU IMAGINE?
SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO GRAB HOLD
OF HIS LEG
WHILE HE IS TRYING TO ESCAPE
AND GET TO THE SURFACE.
ACTUALLY HAD TO KICK THIS PERSON'S
HAND OFF TO GET FREE FROM THE BUS
AND ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
ESCAPE FROM THE WRECK.
39 PEOPLE REMAINED TRAPPED ON
THE BUS AND DIDN'T SURVIVE.
IN THE PANIC OF HIS ESCAPE, DIRCEU
DOESN'T REMEMBER SEEING ANY PIRANHAS,
SO NO ONE KNOWS HOW LONG IT WAS AFTER THE
BUS SUBMERGED THAT THE PIRANHAS ATTACKED.
EVEN TO THIS DAY, JUST GOING OVER THE BRIDGE,
WHICH THEY'VE GOT NOW OVER THE RIVER,
HE SAYS EVERY TIME HE CROSSES,
HE JUST REMEMBERS THAT DAY.
IT WAS SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE RESCUERS
COULD WINCH THE BUS OUT OF THE WATER.
BY THAT TIME, IT WAS FAR TOO LATE
FOR ANY REMAINING PASSENGERS.
THERE WERE THREE CHILDREN AND ONE BABY
ACTUALLY ALL FROM THE SAME FAMILY.
THEY WERE BROUGHT UP DEAD.
THERE WAS ONE BODY THERE HAD LITERALLY
BEEN STRIPPED OF ALL THE FLESH.
ONLY THE BOOTS WERE LEFT.
THE IMPACT PIRANHAS HAVE
ON A HUMAN BODY IS DISTINCT
AND MAY BE TOO SHOCKING
FOR SOME VIEWERS TO SEE.
THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES FROM RECENT CASES
ARRIVING AT THE MANAUS CITY MORGUE
SHOW JUST WHAT A PIRANHA IS CAPABLE OF
DOING AND THE TYPE OF WOUNDS IT LEAVES.
EXPOSED FLESH AND SOFT TISSUE
ARE REMOVED FIRST,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT DORA DI BARBOSSA
WITNESSED WHEN SHE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE
AS THE BODIES WERE BEING
EXTRACTED FROM THE BUS.
SHE TOLD ME THAT SOME OF THE VICTIMS WERE
BROUGHT OUT STILL HUGGING EACH OTHER.
AND HER STORY MADE ME TRULY REALIZE WHAT
IT MEANT TO LOSE SOMEONE IN THIS CRASH.
DORA WAS JUST 17 YEARS OLD
AT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY.
AND WHAT HAPPENED...
SHE WAS LIVING IN ITACOATIARA,
AND SHE JUST ACTUALLY STARTED
HER NURSE TRAINING AT THE TIME.
AND, SO, SHE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE
RIVER OF THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT.
HMM.
THAT'S PRETTY TRAGIC.
DORA SAYS SHE DID KNOW
SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON THE BUS,
WHICH JUST MAKES IT SORT OF
EXTRA, EXTRA HORRIFIC, REALLY.
THERE WAS THE HUSBAND
OF THE TEACHER OF HERS,
AND SHE SAYS THAT HIS FACE WAS
COMPLETELY EATEN AWAY DOWN...
NOT DOWN TO THE BONE
BUT DOWN TO CARTILAGE.
AND ALSO, A LAD CALLED IVAN,
WHO SHE LIKED VERY MUCH,
THIS WAS
HER CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART.
AND HE WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS,
AS WELL.
AND SHE SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THIS,
SHE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT EARLY ON
TO TALK ABOUT
THIS WHOLE BUSINESS.
BUT AS A RESULT OF THIS,
SHE SAID SHE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
LEFT THE AREA AND DIDN'T RETURN FOR A WHILE
BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES OF THE PLACE.
JUST LIKE THE TESTIMONIES
FROM THE BUS CRASH,
THE MORGUE PICTURES
LEAVE US IN NO DOUBT
AS TO THE HORRORS PIRANHAS
CAN INFLICT ON A HUMAN BODY.
BUT AS THE BUS CRASH HAPPENED
30 YEARS AGO,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF THE VICTIMS DIED
OF THE WOUNDS INFLICTED BY THE PIRANHAS
OR IF THEY WERE ALREADY DEAD.
WE KNOW THAT ON THE BUS, THEY WERE
TRAPPED, THERE WAS BLOOD IN THE WATER,
AND PEOPLE WERE EATEN
BY PIRANHAS.
BUT DID THE PIRANHAS ATTACK
AND EAT THEIR VICTIMS ALIVE
OR DID THEY MERELY SCAVENGE THE CORPSES
OF THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY DROWNED?
SO EVEN THOUGH I HAVE FOUND
MY BUS CRASH,
THE CASE AGAINST THE PIRANHA
STILL HANGS IN THE BALANCE.
MY QUEST TO INVESTIGATE THE
BLOODTHIRSTY REPUTATION OF THE PIRANHA
IS STILL UNRESOLVED.
ALTHOUGH PIRANHAS HAVE WITHOUT DOUBT FED
ON DEAD HUMAN FLESH, I'M YET TO FIND PROOF
THAT THEY HAVE KILLED
A LIVING HUMAN.
MAYBE BRIAN ZIMMERMAN
WAS RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK
THE REPUTATION OF PIRANHAS
AS BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS
IS DESERVED AT ALL.
PIRANHA ARE JUST ANIMAL THAT IS
TRYING TO SURVIVE IN THE WILD
WHEN THEY HAPPEN TO BE
A CARNIVOROUS FISH.
YET IN FLOODED WATER BODIES LIKE
THIS, SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED
THAT THERE ARE DOUBLE THE
NUMBER OF PIRANHAS THAN NORMAL.
AND THIS HAS LED TO A SITUATION WHERE THEIR
INNOCENCE IS ONCE AGAIN IN QUESTION.
ALL OVER BRAZIL, DAMS LIKE THIS
HAVE CREATED ARTIFICIAL LAKES
WHICH ARE VERY POPULAR PLACES
TO COME FOR A SWIM,
PARTICULARLY IN THE HEAT
OF THE DRY SEASON.
PUT THAT TOGETHER WITH A
CONCENTRATED POPULATION OF PIRANHAS
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE.
HUMANS BEING ATTACKED BY MAN-EATING
FISH IS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES.
AND IT HAS FUELED AN INDUSTRY OF FEAR
WHICH HOLLYWOOD HAS HAPPILY EMBRACED.
IF YOU'RE ON A BEACH BY THE OCEAN,
SHARKS CAN BE A VERY REAL CONCERN.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO ENTER THE WATER
WITH A FEAR OF WHAT MIGHT LURK BENEATH.
BUT DEEP INLAND, OVER
A THOUSAND MILES FROM THE SEA,
MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT EXPECT
TO BE A VICTIM.
YET ON THE WEEKEND OF DECEMBER THE 21st,
2005, AT THE END OF THE DRY SEASON,
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
ON A BEACH EXPOSED BY THE SEASONAL LOW
WATER, EIGHT PEOPLE WERE ATTACKED.
AND THE PERPETRATORS
OF THESE ATTACKS WERE PIRANHAS.
IN A PERIOD OF SEVEN MONTHS, 190
PEOPLE WERE BITTEN BY PIRANHAS.
UNLIKE THE BUS CRASH,
THESE WEREN'T FRENZIED ATTACKS
WHICH LEFT THE CORPSES
HALF EATEN.
THESE WERE INDIVIDUAL BITES.
NO ONE WAS TRAPPED, INJURED,
OR BLEEDING.
YET THE PIRANHAS WERE DEFINITELY
ATTACKING LIVE PEOPLE.
OBVIOUSLY, SOMETHING STRANGE
HAD OCCURRED HERE.
I'VE COME TO ONE
OF THESE ARTIFICIAL LAKES
CREATED BY A DAM
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
AND TO SEE WHAT KIND OF
PIRANHAS ARE LIVING HERE.
ALL THIS USED TO BE RAINFOREST.
BUT WHEN THE WATER ROSE, THE TREES ALL
DIED, JUST LEAVING THIS WEIRD LANDSCAPE.
THERE WE GO. THERE'S A KNOT.
THERE'S SOMETHING ON THERE.
RIGHT. HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.
THAT'S A SIZABLE FISH.
THAT'S A PIRANHA,
BUT THAT IS A BIG PIRANHA.
NOW, THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE
GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH.
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL,
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
AND THERE IT IS.
IMAGINE SWIMMING WITH THESE BOYS
IN THE WATER.
OH, CRUNCH.
OH!
CRUNCHING ON THE HOOK
AS I TAKE IT OUT.
HOW ABOUT THAT
FOR A PIRANHA?
THIS IS A BLACK PIRANHA.
IT'S THE BIGGEST SPECIES
OF PIRANHA.
LOOK AT THOSE TEETH.
LOOK AT THOSE TEETH.
I'M BEING
EXTREMELY CAREFUL HERE.
THEY JUST HAVE
SUCH POWERFUL JAWS,
AND THAT WOULD TAKE A SERIOUS
SIZE LUMP OUT OF YOU...
LITERALLY THE SIZE OF THAT JAW,
THAT WOULD BE THE SIZE OF THE
HOLE THAT YOU'D BE MISSING.
THOSE TEETH ARE SO SHARP THAT
WHEN PEOPLE GET CUT BY THEM,
THEY SAY THEY DON'T EVEN FEEL IT
WHEN IT HAPPENS.
THEY ONLY NOTICE IT
WHEN THEY SEE THE BLOOD.
IT WAS THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS, SINGLE
BITES, THAT WERE BEING MADE AT THE BEACH.
BUT AGAIN, BRIAN'S THEORY THAT PIRANHAS
ARE MISUNDERSTOOD HAS AN EXPLANATION.
PIRANHA TEND TO BUILD THEIR
NESTS IN VERY SHALLOW AREAS
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO HAVE VEGETATION,
NOT ONLY FOR THE EGGS TO STICK TO
BUT ALSO FOR THE YOUNG FRY TO RETREAT
WHEN THEY'RE FIRST HATCHING.
SO, IN CASES
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BITTEN,
I MEAN, I SUPPOSE SOMEBODY
WADING IN SHALLOW WATER
AND HAPPENS TO TREAD
ONTO THE NEST OF A PIRANHA
WHERE THERE'S A BIG MALE
DEFENDING ITS EGGS
IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING A BITE.
THE BEACH ATTACKS OCCURRED WHEN
THERE WERE MOST PEOPLE IN THE WATER
ON THE HOTTEST DAYS
OF THE END OF THE DRY SEASON.
IT IS AT THIS POINT, USUALLY JUST AFTER
THE FIRST RAINS, WHEN PIRANHAS BREED.
ALL THEY WERE DOING WAS SIMPLY
WHAT MOST LIVING CREATURES DO...
PROTECTING THEIR YOUNG.
SO THESE MULTIPLE PIRANHA ATTACKS
ACTUALLY REVEAL A CARING ANIMAL
THAT, IN THIS INSTANCE,
HAS NO INTENTION TO KILL.
PIRANHA ARE VERY NERVOUS FISH.
WE WERE INVOLVED IN A STUDY RECENTLY
WHICH WAS LOOKING AT THE REASONS
FOR SHOALING BEHAVIOR IN PIRANHA,
AND THE STUDY ACTUALLY FOUND
THAT INSTEAD OF THEM BEING PACK
HUNTERS AND LIVING TOGETHER IN GROUPS
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO HUNT
THEIR PREY,
THEY ACTUALLY LIVE IN SHOALS
TO AVOID PREDATORS THEMSELVES
AND IT'S LIKE A CASE
OF SAFETY IN NUMBERS.
IF PIRANHAS GROUP TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THEIR
MORTAL FEAR OF ANOTHER RIVER MONSTER,
THEN THIS IS A CREATURE
I NEED TO MEET.
PIRANHAS MAY ENJOY A REPUTATION AS
EVIL KILLERS BUT HERE IN THE AMAZON,
THEY ARE FAR FROM THE TOP
OF THE FOOD CHAIN.
THIS RIVER IS A SUPREMELY
PREDATORY ENVIRONMENT.
AND I'M TOLD THAT THERE ARE WILD RIVER
MONSTERS THAT COME HERE TO BE FED BY LOCALS.
THESE CREATURES ARE HIGHLY ADAPTED KILLERS
AND GREATLY FEARED BY THE PIRANHAS.
AND ONCE AGAIN, I'M THE GUINEA PIG THAT
IS ENTERING THE WATER TO MEET THEM.
DOLPHINS.
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT?
THOUSAND MILES FROM THE OCEAN,
RIGHT UP THE AMAZON RIVER.
FRESHWATER DOLPHINS.
AND THESE GUYS... I MEAN,
THEY'RE ARE HAVING FUN NOW,
BUT MY GOODNESS...
THEY'VE ALSO GOT A DARK SIDE.
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FRENZY.
THAT ONE BIT MY THUMB.
THAT ONE GOT MY THUMB.
OH, DEAR.
HEY!
AND THESE ARE THE GUYS
THAT TAKE OUT PIRANHAS.
LITTLE BIT EAGER,
A LITTLE BIT EAGER.
THE JAW... VERY, VERY LONG
AND ELONGATED, FULL OF TEETH...
JUST PERFECT FOR GRABBING FISH.
WOW.
THEY'VE ALSO GOT THIS REALLY
STRANGE BULGING HEAD,
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY... OOP!...
AND ECHOLOCATION ORGAN.
A LOT OF THESE WATERS
IN THE AMAZON ARE VERY MURKY.
AND THEY CAN'T SEE THEIR PREY.
BUT EVEN IN THAT SITUATION, THEY CAN
FIND AND KILL THEIR PREY... OHH!...
USING SONAR.
OHH-HOO-HOO.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY, VERY
CAREFUL TANGLING WITH THESE CREATURES.
TIME FOR ME TO GET OUT, I THINK.
THE AMAZON IS THE MOST PREDATOR-FILLED
WATERWAY ON THE PLANET.
EVERYTHING KILLS OR IS KILLED.
I'VE SPENT YEARS FISHING THIS RIVER,
AND I KNOW IT IS CRAMMED FULL
OF THE MEANEST,
NASTIEST CREATURES.
PERHAPS PIRANHAS
ARE NOT UNUSUAL.
THEY JUST GET SINGLED OUT FOR ATTENTION
BECAUSE THEY CAPTURE OUR IMAGINATION.
BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHAT TRIGGERS THEIR ATTACKS.
IT'S STRONG AND HEAVY.
LOOK AT THIS!
A NEW SPECIES FOR ME.
I KNOW THE SPECIES, BUT I'VE
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER CAUGHT ONE.
THERE'S A LUMP TAKEN OUT OF IT
BY PIRANHA.
THEY CAN TELL WHEN A FISH IS IN
DISTRESS, AND THEY GO AFTER IT.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE SHAPE
HERE OF A PIRANHA JAW.
SOMETHING CHOMPED THIS FISH
ON THE WAY IN.
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY THESE FISH
ARE PAYING COMPLETE ATTENTION
TO NOT ENDING UP ON THE MENU.
THIS ONE BASICALLY THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE FOR JUST A MOMENT,
AND A PIRANHA CAME
AND CHOPPED IT.
SO YOU'VE LITERALLY
GOT TO WATCH YOUR BACK.
THIS ARMORED CATFISH
WAS A FANTASTIC CATCH.
BUT SEEING THE PIRANHA BITE ON ITS BACK
HAS CRYSTALLIZED EVERYTHING FOR ME.
THIS FISH LIVES IN AND AMONGST
PIRANHA EVERY DAY OF ITS LIFE.
YET, STRUGGLING ON THE END OF MY
LINE, IT INSTANTLY BECAME A TARGET.
IT IS THE THRASHING STRUGGLE
OF DISTRESS
THAT TRIGGERS THE PIRANHA'S NATURAL
INSTINCTS TO TARGET THE WEAK AND HELPLESS.
THIS EXPLAINS WHY I CAN SWIM
AND SPLASH AROUND WITH PIRANHAS
YET THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE
IN THE BUS CRASH
INITIATED THE PIRANHAS'
PREDATORY INSTINCTS.
IT'S SOBERING TO THINK OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE POOR PASSENGERS THAT DAY
AS THEY TRAVELED
BACK TO THEIR HOMETOWN.
THEIR LIVES WERE NEVER MEANT
TO CROSS WITH PIRANHAS.
YET, FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE AMAZON,
LIFE IS LITERALLY LIVED ON THE WATER.
WITH SUCH HUGE SEASONAL
VARIATIONS IN WATER LEVEL,
ENTIRE VILLAGES
FLOAT ON THE RIVER.
AND THERE'S ONE WHOSE VERY NAME
SUGGESTS THE REALITY THEY
DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS.
THIS PLACE IS KNOWN
AS ""THE PIRANHA RESERVE.""
I'VE COME HERE TO FIND OUT
WHAT LIFE IS LIKE
LIVING WITH THE CONSTANT THREAT
OF PIRANHAS.
THESE PEOPLE ARE KNOWN AS
RIBEIRINHOS, OR RIVER PEOPLE.
ALMOST EVERYTHING THEY NEED IS SOURCED
FROM OR AROUND THE AMAZON RIVER.
LET'S SEE IF THE PIRANHA
RESERVE LIVES UP TO ITS NAME
AND WHAT KIND OF PIRANHAS
THEY HAVE HERE.
THE LINE IS
FLAT ON THE SURFACE.
THERE IT GOES.
RED-BELLIED. THERE WE GO.
WHOOP! NOW, RIGHT.
YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE... I COULDN'T
DO THAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE SHOES ON.
YOU CAN SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HERE
ARE MISSING BITS OUT OF THEIR TOES.
EVERY ONE OF THESE
IS A RED-BELLIED.
I MEAN, THIS ONE'S GOT
SLIGHT SPOTS ON IT, AS WELL,
BUT THAT JUST MEANS
IT'S A JUVENILE.
AGAIN, AGAIN. HERE WE GO.
THERE'S ALMOST
MORE FISH THAN WATER.
EVERY SINGLE CHUCK,
OUT COMES A RED-BELLIED PIRANHA.
THEY'RE NOT VERY BIG,
BUT MY GOODNESS.
THERE ARE JUST LOADS OF THEM
DOWN HERE.
I'VE HEARD ALL THESE STORIES ABOUT PIRANHAS
BEING CAPABLE OF SKELETONIZING BODIES
LITERALLY WITHIN MOMENTS
OR MINUTES.
I'VE GOT THIS FRESHLY KILLED
DUCK HERE FROM THE MARKET,
AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO PUT
THOSE STORIES TO THE TEST.
IT'S APPARENT THAT THE SOUND,
THE THRASHING OF A DISTRESSED
ANIMAL IS WHAT ATTRACTS THEM.
SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT
TO START THEM HONING IN.
RIGHT, THEY'RE IN THERE.
THEY'RE IN THERE ALREADY.
I JUST SAW A FLASH OF SILVER WITH
VERY DISTINCTIVE RED, AS WELL.
RIGHT, THEY'RE STARTING
TO ARRIVE NOW.
ONCE ONE FINDS IT, BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,
THAT JUST KICKS THE WHOLE THING OFF.
LOOK AT THAT.
DOING THE HEAD THERE.
THEY'VE ALREADY JUST STRIPPED
ALL THE FLESH FROM THE SPINE.
FLIP THIS IN AND HAVE A LOOK.
OH. RIGHT.
FROM THE BACK,
THIS DIDN'T LOOK TOO BAD,
BUT ACTUALLY FLIP IT OVER,
THE SIDE WHERE THE FISH WERE,
AND THEY'VE MADE A REAL MESS
OF THAT.
THEY'VE ACTUALLY CHEWED THROUGH
A HUGE EXPANSE OF FEATHER
TO GET AT THE MEAT, AND THEY'VE
GONE RIGHT INTO THE BODY CAVITY.
THEY'VE TAKEN
MOST OF THE MEAT AWAY.
THERE'S A HUGE SECTION OF ACTUALLY
THE BACKBONE GONE IN THE NECK.
THE HEAD IS JUST REDUCED
TO BONE.
BOTH EYES ARE GONE.
AND ALL THIS JUST
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.
IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT THIS IS
RIGHT OUTSIDE SOMEONE'S FRONT DOOR.
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE, DEALING WITH
THE DANGERS OF PIRANHAS ON A DAILY BASIS
IS JUST PART OF LIFE.
I VISIT SOME OF THE FAMILIES WHO
LIVE HERE TO FIND OUT HOW THEY COPE.
BUT I DISCOVER A STORY OF A PIRANHA
ATTACK THAT CHILLS ME TO MY VERY BONES.
THIS REMOTE PLACE IS ACTUALLY
CALLED THE PIRANHA RESERVE.
BUT WHAT I SOON LEARN IS THAT
IT IS IN THE DRY SEASON
WHEN THE WATER IS LOW AND
THE PIRANHAS ARE CONCENTRATED
THAT THE VILLAGERS
ARE MOST AT RISK.
IT IS A PARTICULAR TIME OF YEAR.
IT'S PRINCIPALLY THE MONTHS
OF SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER HERE.
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IN THE WATER
TO HAVE A WASH.
THE MAIN FOOD ITEM HERE IS FISH,
SO THERE YOU ARE.
YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THE FISH IN
ORDER TO PREPARE IT FOR THE MEAL,
AND JUST THE SMELL OF THAT WILL BRING
A CONCENTRATION OF PIRANHAS THERE,
SO YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
KEEP YOUR FINGERS
NOWHERE NEAR THE WATER.
BUT ON ONE OCCASION, THIS FAMILY DROPPED
THEIR GUARD WITH HORRIFIC CONSEQUENCES.
IT WAS A GRANDSON OF JULIO'S.
THEY'RE SAYING, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
LOOK AFTER KIDS ALL THE TIME.
HIS WIFE WAS CLEANING SOME FISH
OFF THE BACK OF THE HOUSE,
AND THE CHILD JUST RAN, AS CHILDREN DO,
FROM ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO THE OTHER
AND FELL IN THE WATER
AT THE OTHER SIDE.
AND HE SAID LITERALLY
THEY HEARD A NOISE.
THEY GOT THERE.
IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE.
THE CHILD FELL IN THE WATER
AND JUST DIDN'T COME UP.
ALL THEY SAID THAT THEY SAW WAS
JUST A TURBULENCE IN THE WATER
OF THE PIRANHAS DEVOURING THE
CHILD JUST LITERALLY MOMENTS
AFTER THE CHILD HAD FALLEN
OFF THE SIDE OF THE BOAT.
WITH NETS, THEY WERE TRYING
TO SORT OF RETRIEVE THE CHILD,
EVEN WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON, AND EVENTUALLY,
HE SAID, ALL THEY GOT IN WAS BONES.
WHEN I ASKED HOW LONG IT TOOK, HE
SAID, NO, THIS HAPPENED VERY RAPIDLY
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE JUST, YOU
KNOW, SO MANY... SO MANY PIRANHAS HERE.
THIS IS WHAT I'D BEEN SEARCHING FOR...
A FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT
OF PIRANHAS ATTACKING, KILLING, AND EATING
A HUMAN, IN THIS CASE, A 3-YEAR-OLD BOY,
WHO THE GRANDFATHER
PREFERRED NOT TO NAME.
YET, THE REALITY
OF HEARING A STORY LIKE THIS
TAKES AWAY ALL FEELINGS
OF SUCCESS I MIGHT HAVE HAD.
IT'S ONE THING TO HEAR
THE MYTH OF PIRANHAS,
BUT I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S QUITE SOMETHING ELSE
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY SEEN
THE TRUTH OF THAT WITH THEIR OWN EYES.
IF YOU CONSIDER THAT
THIS IS JUST ONE OF HUNDREDS
OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR ISOLATED
SETTLEMENTS FOUND ALL ALONG THE AMAZON,
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE
CASES REMAIN UNREPORTED?
THESE LADS ARE JUST... THEY'RE JUST BALANCING
ON PIECES OF WOOD ABOUT THAT WIDE.
I'VE JUST HEARD THIS HORRIFIC STORY
ABOUT SOMEBODY FALLING INTO THIS WATER
AND GETTING JUST DEVOURED IN SECONDS, AND
THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM BOTHERED BY IT.
MUCH AS WE MIGHT LIVE
WITH THE EVER-PRESENT THREAT
OF A LETHAL HIGHWAY ON OUR DOORSTEP,
THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE THEIR LIVES
WITHIN FEET OF DEADLY PIRANHAS.
I GUESS LIKE A LOT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW,
LIVING IN A FLOATING HOUSE LIKE THIS
WITH THESE PIRANHAS UNDERNEATH,
AFTER A WHILE, IT'S JUST THERE.
IT'S JUST AUTOMATIC.
YOU JUST GET USED TO IT.
THERE ARE JUST PRECAUTIONS
THAT YOU TAKE.
YOU CAN'T BE THINKING ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.
IF YOU WERE, YOU JUST WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
IT'S JUST THIS EVER-PRESENT PRESENCE
UNDERNEATH AND ALL AROUND YOU.
I SET OUT ON THIS JOURNEY TO FIND
AN EYEWITNESS TO A PIRANHA ATTACK
IN THE HOPE THAT THEIR EVIDENCE
MIGHT GIVE ME THE PROOF I NEEDED
TO KNOW IF THE BLOODTHIRSTY REPUTATION
OF THE PIRANHA IS JUSTIFIED.
I'VE FOUND THAT PIRANHAS
ARE SOMETIMES SHY,
SOMETIMES DEFENSIVE, AND THEY
ARE SOMEWHAT MISUNDERSTOOD.
BUT IF YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC COMBINATION
OF THE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR, BLOOD,
THE STRUGGLE OF DISTRESS, AND
A TRAPPED OR WEAKENED PERSON,
YOU WILL TRIGGER
A PIRANHA FEEDING FRENZY.
IN A RIVER FULL OF MONSTERS, THIS
IS JUST A NATURAL ADAPTATION
TO LIFE HERE IN THE AMAZON.
BUT NO WATER WHAT, THE PIRANHA
WILL CONTINUE TO EVOKE FEAR
AND HORROR
IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.","The red-bellied piranha, also known as the red piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family Serrasalmidae, which includes the pacus, piranhas and related fishes. The red-bellied piranha occurs in South America, found in the Amazon, Paraguay, Paraná and Essequibo basins, as well as coastal rivers of northeastern Brazil. This fish is locally abundant in its freshwater habitat. 
They are carnivorous foragers and feed on insects, worms, crustaceans and fish. Opportunistic feeders as they are, will also take advantage of edible aquatic plants as well as any fruits, nuts or seeds that may fall into the waters. They are not a migratory species but do travel to seek out conditions conducive to breeding and spawning during periods of increased rainfall. Red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense but rarely exhibit group hunting behavior. Acoustic communication is common and is sometimes exhibited along with aggressive behaviors. They are a popular aquarium fish.


== Etymology ==
The fish is named after Johann Natterer.


== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The red-bellied piranha belongs to the family Serrasalmidae, which is a group of medium to large-sized characids and includes other closely related omnivores such as pacus. They are characterized by deep, lateral compressed bodies and long dorsal fins. Within the family, red-bellied piranhas are classified in the genus Pygocentrus, which is distinguished by the unusual dentition and differing head width dimensions. The red-bellied piranha is often thought of as highly carnivorous, while most other fish that are not piranhas in the family are primarily herbivorous. However, the red-bellied piranha is actually omnivorous.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The red-bellied piranha is distributed widely throughout the South American continent and is found in the Neotropical rivers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. They live in the warm freshwater drainages of several major rivers including the Amazon, Paraguay, Paraná, and Essequibo, as well as numerous smaller systems.
They can live in waters that are between 15 and 35 °C (59–95 °F) but are able to survive temperatures as low as 10 °C (50 °F) for a period. They are mainly found in whitewater, but have also been recorded in blackwater and clearwater. The red-bellied piranha live in major rivers, streams, lakes (such as oxbows and artificial lakes formed by dams), floodplains, and flooded forests. They were introduced to China, probably by the aquarium trade. First detected in 1990 they have since become invasive in the country.
No piranha is found in the United States including this one. In 1998 a single specimen was found in a lake in a golf course in Simi Valley, Ventura County, California. California and Washington prohibit P. nattereri and encourage surveillance to prevent its introduction.


== Description ==

The red-bellied piranha has a popular reputation as a ferocious predator, despite being primarily a scavenger. As their name suggests, red-bellied piranhas have a reddish tinge to the belly when fully grown, although juveniles are a silver color with darker spots. The species can reach up to 3.9 kg (8 lb 10 oz) in weight and 50 cm (20 in) in standard length but rarely surpass 35 cm (14 in). The rest of the body is often grey with silver-flecked scales. Sometimes, blackish spots appear behind the gills and the anal fin is usually black at the base. The pectoral and pelvic fins may vary from red to orange. Females can be distinguished from males by the slightly deeper red color of their bellies.
The red-bellied piranha is typically found in white water rivers, such as the Amazon River Basin, and in some streams and lakes. Sometimes, they may inhabit flooded forests such as those found in the Brazilian Amazon. They live in shoals but do not group hunt, although they may occasionally enter into feeding frenzies. In the case of a feeding frenzy, schools of piranha will converge on one large prey individual and eat it within minutes. These attacks are usually extremely rare and are due to provocation or starvation. Breeding occurs over a two-month period during the rainy season, but that can vary by area. Females will lay around 5,000 eggs on newly submerged vegetation in nests that are built by the males.
A significant amount of lore regarding the ferocity of the red-bellied piranha can be traced to President Theodore Roosevelt following the completion of the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition. The former president returned with dramatic stories of an entire cow being devoured to the bones within a matter of a few minutes. This event was later found to be staged by local guides, eager to provide Roosevelt with a spectacle worthy of the journey. It later surfaced the fish had been corralled and starved for over a week, into a section of the river, into which the unfortunate cow was driven for the event. There is nothing to suggest Roosevelt was ever aware of this fact.


== Behavior ==

Pygocentrus nattereri encompasses a larger geographic area than any other piranha species, covering much of the Neotropical region. When red-bellied piranhas are introduced to other parts of the American continent, there are usually negative consequences for the local fish fauna, partially due to its generally aggressive behavior. This aggressive behavior is sometimes marked by the acoustic sounds they produce.
The red-bellied piranha is not a migratory species but does search for conditions conducive to reproduction during seasons of increased rainfall. Red-bellied piranhas are omnivores and primarily foragers. They feed on insects, fish, plants, and organic debris. Bechara et al., 1996 finds P. nattereri is almost immune to gas bubble disease which is devastating to almost all fish in the same environment.


=== Diet and feeding behavior ===
The typical diet of red-bellied piranhas is omnivorous including fruit, leaves, insects, mollusks, carrion and fish. In packs up to hundreds, piranhas have been known to feed on animals as large as egrets or capybara. Despite the piranha's reputation as a dangerous carnivore, it is actually primarily a scavenger and forager, and will mainly eat plants and insects during the rainy season when food is abundant. They also tend to feed only on weak, injured, dying, or dead animals in the wild. Red-bellied piranhas do not stay in groups in order to pack-hunt for larger animals, but instead group for protection against predators.
Foraging methods vary throughout the different stages of a piranha's life. Smaller fish will search for food during the day, while larger fish will forage at dawn, in the late afternoon, and in the early evening. Throughout the day, the fish lurk in dark areas and ambush their prey. The piranha may also catch prey by hunting and chasing, where it will lie hidden in the vegetation until its prey swims by. The piranha will then capture its prey. When scavenging, the piranha will eat a wide variety of food, ranging from pieces of debris, insects, snails, fish fins, scales, and plants.


=== Reproduction ===
The breeding habits of piranhas in nature are mostly unknown, with most spawning research being done in aquariums. Piranhas are usually able to breed by the time they are one year old. Female piranhas will lay several thousand eggs near water plants, onto which the eggs stick. The males then fertilize the eggs. After just two to three days the eggs will hatch, and the juvenile piranhas will hide in the plants until they are large enough to defend themselves, at which point hiding from predators becomes lurking for prey.
Research on red-bellied piranha breeding behavior in nature has revealed certain behavioral patterns around nesting sites. Adult piranhas will swim side-by-side in small circles, sometimes with two individuals swimming in opposite directions while keeping their ventral surfaces close to one another. Although this may appear to be a courtship display, a closer look reveals that the adults are actually defending nesting sites. The nests are about 4 to 5 centimetres (1+1⁄2 to 2 in) deep, and are dug among water grasses, with the eggs attached to the grasses and plant stems.
This formation of mating pairs, nuptial swimming displays, and guarding of the nests shows that red-bellied piranhas exhibit parental care for the nest and the young. When left unattended, other fish, such as characids, may prey upon the eggs. Despite the defensive practice of circling the nests, red-bellied piranhas are often passive toward other fish that approach the nest. It is possible that the mere presence of the piranha, a natural predator, provides enough of a threat to prevent potential predators from approaching the nest.
Piranhas have two annual reproductive seasons; these seasons are tied to water level fluctuations, the flooding pulse, temperature, and other hydrological conditions. When individuals are ready to become sexually active, they will lose their red coloration and select habitats that are conducive to spawning, such as flooded marginal grasses and vegetation within lakes. This habitat selection is a clear distinction from non-reproductive individuals that prefer open water and under floating meadows.


=== Shoaling ===

Red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense, as well as for the offense. In studies that tested the piranhas' reactions to a simulated predator attack, resting opercular rates returned to normal more quickly among piranhas that were in shoals of eight rather than in shoals of two. Although it has been presumed that piranhas engage in pack-hunting behavior, no investigation shows that shoaling behavior among piranhas is used for cooperative hunting.
Most likely, this shoaling behavior is a defense against predation from larger animals such as dolphins, large piscivorous fish, caimans, and aquatic birds such as storks, herons, and anhingas. Piranhas will travel to their nesting sites in shoals in order to reduce the likelihood that any single individual will be attacked by a predator. Shoals of red-bellied piranha use the margins of flooded areas to build their nests.


=== Communication and signaling ===
Acoustic communication among red-bellied piranhas is exhibited along with aggressive behaviors, such as biting, chasing, conspecific confrontation, and fighting. The sounds created by piranhas are generated through rapid contractions of the sonic muscles and is associated with the swimbladder. The swimbladder may play an important role in sound production as a resonator.
All of the observations made on sound production by red-bellied piranha have been when specimens were held by hand. When taken out of the water, the red-bellied piranha will emit a drumming-like sound, consisting of a low-frequency harmonic sound. However, research has shown the presence of three types of acoustic emissions that are associated with specific behaviors. Type one calls are made up of  harmonic sounds, last approximately 140 milliseconds at 120 Hz, and are associated with frontal display behavior between two fish. Type two sounds last approximately 36 milliseconds at 40 Hz, and are associated with circling and fighting behavior related to food competition. Type three sounds are made up of a single pulse lasting just 3 milliseconds at 1740 Hz, and are highly associated with chasing behavior toward a conspecific individual. This same sound is also produced when an individual snaps its jaws to bite another individual.
Nearly all sounds produced by red-bellied piranhas are produced in the context of social interactions between individuals. The low, drumming sounds are typically produced during moderate attacks, while loud, threatened sounds are produced during more vigorous attacks.


== Conservation status ==

The red-bellied piranha is widespread and locally abundant. In some parts of its range, it is among the most common fish species. The collection and trade of the species to aquariums may locally present a low risk to the red-bellied piranha.


== In the media ==

Many myths surround this species. The 1978 film Piranha by Joe Dante shows these fish in a similar light to sharks in Jaws. Piranha was followed by a sequel, Piranha II: The Spawning, in 1982, and two remakes, one in 1995, and  Piranha 3D in 2010, which also got a sequel of its own, Piranha 3DD. Films such as these, and stories of large schools of red-bellies attacking humans, fuel their exaggerated and erroneous reputation as being one of the most ferocious freshwater fish. In reality, they are generally timid scavengers, fulfilling a role similar to vultures on land. In Piranha 3D, a previously unknown piranha is discovered. Christopher Lloyd's character misidentifies a specimen of this monstrous new species as the familiar Pygocentrus nattereri.


== In aquariums ==
Red-bellied piranhas are sometimes kept as aquarium fish. They may be fed live, fresh, or frozen food, but they will not eat rotten meats. Their natural diet consists of live prey and dead animals or fish. Live feedings to captive piranhas can introduce diseases, and goldfish contain a growth-inhibiting hormone, which in turn will affect piranhas. Red-bellied piranhas, particularly when juvenile, will sometimes bite one another in the aquarium, normally on the fins, in behavior called 'fin nipping'. Those that have had their fins nipped will grow them back surprisingly rapidly. To maintain a piranha aquarium, it is important to keep the water quality up, as they are messy eaters, and this will dirty the water in the tank. Also, they need places to hide in dim light. Because in the wild they may not eat every day, those in captivity do not need to be fed daily, but when hungry, they can eat each other.

A CREATURE AS DEADLY AS A SHARK
AND AS BIG AS A GATOR IS BLAMED.
WHEREVER WE HAVE ALLIGATOR GAR,
THERE ARE MYTHS OF MONSTERS.
THE STATE AUTHORITIES SAID
IT SHOULD BE ELECTROCUTED.
NOW I'M ON A MISSION TO GET FACE-TO-FACE
WITH THIS RIVER MONSTER... WHOO!
YOU BETTER BE STRAPPED IN.
TO FIND OUT IF THIS ANIMAL REALLY IS
GUILTY OF THE CRIMES IT'S BLAMED FOR.
I'M JEREMY WADE, A FISHERMAN AND A BIOLOGIST
WITH A PASSION FOR FRESHWATER GIANTS.
I'VE TRAVELED THE GLOBE,
PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE TO
FIND TRULY MONSTER-SIZED FISH.
IT'S BECOME SOMETHING
OF AN OBSESSION FOR ME
TO GET INTO REALLY REMOTE PARTS
OF THE WORLD
AND TO FIND THE ANIMALS
THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN.
BUT THE CREATURES
I HUNT AND FIND
ARE NOT JUST MONSTERS IN SIZE,
BUT IN ATTITUDE, TOO.
AND NOW I'M ON THE TRAIL OF ONE THAT
HAS A REPUTATION FOR ATTACKING HUMANS.
I'VE HEARD SOME ALARMING STORIES
OF THIS CREATURE OVER MANY YEARS,
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE
IN THE FLESH.
IT'S THE ALLIGATOR GAR,
A TRULY PREHISTORIC MONSTER.
THERE ARE FIVE SPECIES OF GAR
THAT INHABIT THE UNITED STATES.
ALL GAR ARE ANCIENT FISH.
THEY'VE EXISTED ON EARTH
FOR OVER 100 MILLION YEARS.
THEIR SURVIVAL IS IN PART BECAUSE
OF THEIR UNIQUE DEFENSE SYSTEM...
SCALES MADE FROM A SUPER-HARD
ENAMEL CALLED GANOIN.
THIS ARMOR PLATING HAS SEEN THEM
SURVIVE PREDATORY DINOSAURS.
THE ALLIGATOR GAR, HOWEVER,
IS IN A CLASS APART.
NAMED FOR THE PROFILE OF ITS SNOUT,
IT'S THE LARGEST OF ALL GAR,
REACHING SOME 10 FEET IN LENGTH
AND WEIGHING OVER 365 POUNDS.
IT HAS A FURTHER DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC...
A DOUBLE ROW OF DAGGER-POINTED TEETH
ALONG THE LENGTH
OF THE UPPER JAW.
BUT THESE ATTRIBUTES
HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH
TO DEFEND IT AGAINST
A MORE MODERN THREAT... MAN.
BEFORE 1930, THEIR RANGE EXTENDED
BEYOND AMERICAN BORDERS,
BUT THE IMPACT OF PEOPLE MEANS
THAT NOW THEY'RE NOT FOUND
ABOVE THE BOOTHEEL
OF MISSOURI AND TENNESSEE.
ALLIGATOR GAR STAND ACCUSED
OF SAVAGE ATTACKS ON HUMANS.
I'VE TRAWLED THE ARCHIVES, AND
ALL THE ATTACKS I'VE COME ACROSS
ARE CONCENTRATED
IN THE DEEP SOUTH.
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE
THE TEETH FOR IT,
BUT I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY HARD
EVIDENCE THAT THESE FISH ARE THE CULPRITS.
IF I'M GOING TO FIND AN ALLIGATOR
GAR GUILTY OF THESE CRIMES,
I'M DEFINITELY LOOKING
FOR A VERY BIG FISH.
THE EXPERTS I'VE SPOKEN TO

GAR THAT WEIGH OVER 100 POUNDS,
SOMETIMES FOR FOOD, BUT NORMALLY
FOR BOW FISHERMEN AFTER TROPHIES.
BUT I'M NOT PLANNING
TO CATCH A FISH FOR A TROPHY.
I WANT TO FIND OUT IF THIS CREATURE HAS
COMMITTED THE CRIMES IT'S ACCUSED OF.
BUBBA IS TAKING ME STRAIGHT
TO A SECTION OF THE TRINITY
THAT HE BELIEVES HOLDS THE BEST
HOPE OF FINDING LARGE GAR.
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE
JUST DRIFTING WITH THE CURRENT,
AND WE'VE JUST COME TO A... A BEND
IN THE RIVER THAT DOUBLES 'ROUND.
AND BUBBA'S JUST SAID THIS IS THE
HOLE, THIS IS A KNOWN HAUNT,
AND I CAN IMAGINE THE CURRENT HAS
ACTUALLY DUG OUT A BIT OF A...
YOU KNOW, A BIT OF A HOLE
IN THE BOTTOM HERE.
AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE VERY AWARE...
MORE AWARE THAN A LOT OF FISH...
OF SORT OF KNOCKING
AND NOISES IN THE BOAT.
SO, WE'RE LITERALLY JUST
DRIFTING WITH THE CURRENT.
AND JUST LOOKING TO SEE IF WE CAN
SEE THEM COME UP AND BREACH.
GAR HAVE A SWIM BLADDER
THAT WORKS LIKE A LUNG,
AN ADAPTATION THAT HELPS THEM SURVIVE
IN OXYGEN-POOR BACKWATERS AND CREEKS.
HOWEVER, THIS BRINGS THEM UP
TO THE SURFACE TO BREATHE.
IT'S A CHINK IN THEIR ARMOR,
GIVING AWAY THEIR PRESENCE.
OOH, YES.
SO, THEY'RE JUST... THEY'RE JUST COMING
UP AND GULPING AIR AND GOING DOWN?
YEAH.
THAT FISH THERE IS MAD.
HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE.
YEAH, EXACTLY. DO YOU KNOW... WHEN
HE SPLASHES HARD LIKE THAT...
I'D GUESS...
ASSUME TO SPOOK US OFF.
YEAH, I'VE COME ACROSS EXACTLY
THE SAME THING IN THE AMAZON.
THERE'S A FISH THERE
THAT COMES UP AND GULPS AIR,
AND IF THEY DO IT GENTLY,
THEY DON'T KNOW YOU'RE THERE.
IF THEY'RE LIKE THAT, YOU THINK,
""OH, THAT'S A GOOD FISH,""
BUT IT IS ACTUALLY GETTING UP AND
GOING DOWN AS QUICKLY AS IT CAN.
SO IT'S THE SAME BEHAVIOR.
THE RIVERS HERE
HAVE MURKY WATER.
WITH VISIBILITY LIMITED, GAR USE A BAND
OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE VIBRATION RECEPTORS
ALONG THEIR BODY
CALLED THE LATERAL LINE.
THIS ENABLES THEM
TO LOCATE PREY AND PREDATORS.
TO AVOID DETECTION, WE DECIDE TO ABANDON
THE BOAT AND FISH FROM THE SHORE.
I'M STILL EXPERIMENTING
WITH BAITS,
AND I'M GOING TO START OFF
USING A TREBLE HOOK...
STANDARD ISSUE
FOR BIG, PREDATORY FISH.
ALTHOUGH THE WATER'S MUDDY, I'VE SEEN
SEVERAL COME AND BREAK THE SURFACE.
SO, I KNOW THEY'RE HERE.
I KNOW THERE ARE FISH
OF 100-POUNDS-PLUS, YOU KNOW,
WITHIN A 25-YARD RADIUS
OF MY BAIT, YOU KNOW?
THAT'S QUITE A FEELING.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN FISHING WHERE
THINGS CAN GO FROM BEING VERY QUIET,
LIKE THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT,
TO... YOU KNOW,
SUDDENLY CAN HAVE
AN ANIMAL OVER 100 POUNDS
ON THE END OF YOUR LINE,
TRYING TO PULL YOU IN THE WATER.
BUT IF THERE IS A MONSTER GATOR
GAR IN THESE TEXAN WATERS,
IT'S NOT
GIVING ITSELF UP EASILY.
IF I'M TO FIND ONE THAT FITS THE
CRIMES IT'S ACCUSED OF... AAH!
IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST AS BIG
AS ME, A REAL RIVER MONSTER.
AT LAKE LIVINGSTON
ON THE TRINITY RIVER IN TEXAS,
I SEEK OUT LEGENDARY FISHERMAN
BOBBY FLY
FOR SOME CLUES ON HOW TO FIND
A GIANT SPECIMEN.
HE CAUGHT ONE SEVEN FEET LONG
THAT PUT HIM IN THE HALL OF FAME,
AND HE BELIEVES THERE ARE STILL
BIG GAR AROUND ON THE TRINITY.
YOU AIN'T GOT TO MOVE YOUR BOAT
100 YARDS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
TO CATCH GOOD GARFISH
RIGHT THERE.
NOW, I HAVE SEEN ONE 14 FOOT
LONG DOWN THERE... GARFISH.
OH, REALLY?
MM-HMM.
I WAS TIED UP ON TOP OF A WILLOW
TREE WITH A 14-FOOT FLAT-BOTTOM,
AND THIS BAD BOY COME RIGHT UP BESIDE
ME AND JUST SURFACED RIGHT THERE.
AND I SEEN THE FRONT OF MY BOAT
AND THE BACK OF MY BOAT,
AND I SEEN FISH ALL THE WAY.
SO, I IMMEDIATELY PULLED UP THE SLACK,
UNDONE MY ROPE, AND WENT ON TO THE HOUSE.
I DIDN'T HANG AROUND.
BUT THIS SIGHTING WAS IN 1987, AND
HIS RECORD CATCH WAS LANDED IN 1991.
OTHER ANGLERS HAVE PULLED OUT
LARGE SPECIMENS,
BUT NO FISH OVER 8 1/2 FEET IN LENGTH
HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN THE LAST DECADE.
THE BIG QUESTION IS...
ARE THERE STILL ANY GAR LEFT
LARGE ENOUGH TO COMMIT
THE ATTACKS THEY'RE ACCUSED OF?
AND IF SO,
HOW WILL I CATCH ONE?
THAT'S INTERESTING. I MEAN, THAT'S A BIG,
FIERCE... BOBBY FLY CAUGHT HIS GIANT
USING A BAIT OF A CARP-LIKE
FISH CALLED A BUFFALO.
AND HOW DID YOU PREPARE THE BUFFALO TO...
OKAY, YOU TAKE THE BUFFALO,
AND YOU WANT A NICE ONE
ABOUT, OH, 5, 10 POUNDS.
THEN YOU TAKE A MALLET
AND BEAT HIM UP.
WHAT, LIKE A HAMMER?
A MALLET.
WELL, A... A LITTLE BASEBALL
BAT'S WHAT WE USED.
AND YOU JUST WHUP ON HIM
REAL GOOD.
AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR CLAWS,
YOUR FINGERNAILS,
AND JUST GET ITS TAIL,
AND YOU JUST STRIP THE FINS OFF.
YEAH.
AND THEN YOU CUT HIM UP IN LITTLE,
BITTY SQUARES, LIKE 1/4-INCH SQUARES.
AND THE BLOOD... THE REASON WHY YOU
BEAT ON THE FISH WITH A MALLET
IS TO GET THAT BLOOD
ALL INTO THE MEAT...
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE SMELLING OUT THERE.
THEY WANT THAT BLOOD.
YOU JUST PUT IT ON THAT HOOK
AND THROW IT UP THERE.
THAT'S ALL VERY INTERESTING.
ALL I GOT TO DO NOW IS GO OUT AND TRY
AND GET SOMETHING SIMILAR-SIZED.
SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT
WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY, I THINK.
WELL, YOU WILL.
YOU WILL.
THERE'S SOME BIG ONES
OUT THERE.
YOU GO DOWN THERE, WHERE I TOLD YOU
TO GO, AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
BOBBY FLY'S OPTIMISM ABOUT THE SIZE
OF THESE FISH IS RINGING IN MY EARS.
BUT I'M STILL UNSURE WHETHER THIS FISH IS
AS AGGRESSIVE AS ITS REPUTATION SUGGESTS.
I'VE HEARD MANY STORIES
OF THESE FISH ATTACKING HUMANS,
BUT ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT STICKS
IN MY MIND, A REALLY GRUESOME REPORT
FROM THE NEIGHBORING STATE,
LOUISIANA.
TRY AND CATCH ME!
ON A WARM, HUMID, SPRING DAY, A 9-YEAR-OLD
SCHOOLGIRL, ELIZABETH GRAINGER,
AND HER 13-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, GEORGE, ARE
PLAYING ON THE SHORELINE OF THE LAKE.
RACE YOU!
IT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU ALWAYS WIN.
ELIZABETH, ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM HER
BROTHER, DANGLES HER FEET IN THE WATER.
YOU ALWAYS WIN.
YOU ALWAYS DO.
AAH!
SUDDENLY SOMETHING GRABS HOLD
OF HER LEG.
AAH!
DR. ROBERT B. PAYNE HAS WORKED AS
A PHYSICIAN FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS.
BUT HE HAS NEVER SEEN
WOUNDS LIKE THIS.
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
MY GOODNESS.
THE PRESS REPORT GEORGE'S CLAIM THAT WHAT
ATTACKED HIS SISTER WAS SEVEN FEET LONG...
AND THAT HE BELIEVED IT
TO BE A GARFISH.
IN HIS MEDICAL REPORT,
DR. PAYNE DESCRIBES THE WOUNDS
AS BEING LIKE COARSE NEEDLES
INSERTED IN A BOARD.
A WAVE OF PARANOIA SOON FOLLOWS, AND
THE ALLIGATOR GAR IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR MANY SIMILAR ATTACKS.
ALTHOUGH THIS WAS
A WELL-DOCUMENTED EVENT,
THE IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKER RESTED ENTIRELY
ON THE TESTIMONY OF A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY.
BUT WAS AN ALLIGATOR GAR
REALLY THE CULPRIT?
OR, WITH ITS THREATENING, PREHISTORIC
APPEARANCE, WAS IT JUST AN OBVIOUS SCAPEGOAT?
I TURN TO MARK SPITZER,
AN EXPERT ON THE GAR.
YOU'VE GOT A...
SORT OF AN INCH-THICK OR SO...
IS THAT WHAT YOU...
IS THAT THE SORT...
THE OFFICIAL GAR HISTORY, AS FAR AS
YOU'VE... WELL, THIS IS MY GAR HISTORY.
I'VE BEEN INTENSELY RESEARCHING
GAR FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS,
AND, YOU KNOW,
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,
WHEREVER WE HAVE ALLIGATOR GAR,
THERE ARE MYTHS OF MONSTERS.
THESE FISH WERE THE FISHES
OF NIGHTMARES, AND SO...
I MEAN, ONE RUMOR
THAT WAS CREATED
WAS THAT THESE FISH EAT TWICE THEIR WEIGHT
IN A DAY AND STUFF LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW,
AND THAT THEY ATTACK
HUMAN BEINGS.
SO, I MEAN, WERE THERE LOTS OF
STORIES OF THAT KIND OF NATURE?
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED
IN THE NEW ORLEANS NEWSPAPER CALLED
""ALLIGATOR GAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN
SO-CALLED 'MAN-EATER' SHARK.""
AND HERE'S...
THIS IS A COPY OF THE ARTICLE.
IT WAS WRITTEN BY AN ANONYMOUS JOURNALIST
WHO BASICALLY SAID IF YOU SHOULD EMERGE
FROM SWIMMING OR TAKING A BATH AND YOU
FIND OUT THAT YOU HAVE A LIMB MISSING,
DO NOT BLAME THE SHARK.
IT IS PROBABLY THE ALLIGATOR GAR
THAT DID IT.
IT'S WHERE DOES THE FACT END AND THE
IMAGINATION AND... AND SORT OF FANTASY START?
THE GAR CAN CERTAINLY GROW
TO A LARGE SIZE.
AND IT HAS A FEROCIOUS ARMORY
OF TEETH.
BUT DOES THIS PROVE AN
INCLINATION TO ATTACK HUMANS?
IS IT A NATURAL
I NEED TO FIND HARD EVIDENCE.
USING THE ADVICE OF FISHING LEGEND BOBBY
FLY, I'M GOING FOR A BAIT OF BUFFALO FISH.
THIS, I HOPE, WILL LET ME GET MY
HANDS ON THE ALLEGED CULPRIT.
BUT I'M LEARNING ON THE JOB.
MY BEST HOPE IS TO TRY AND GET
INTO THE MIND OF THE GAR.
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
A VERY SHORT TIME.
AND BECAUSE SO FEW PEOPLE FISH
FOR THESE FISH...
IT'S A BIG, UGLY,
STUPID-LOOKING FISH.
SO, LET'S USE
FAIRLY BASIC TACKLE.
AND, YOU KNOW, NORMALLY
IT'S A THICK BIT OF WIRE,
SOME HEAVY LINE,
AND A BIG TREBLE HOOK.
I THINK THEY'RE
ACTUALLY QUITE SENSITIVE.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN STILL...
YOU CAN STILL BE SENSITIVE
EVEN IF YOU'VE GOT
SORT OF A BOGEY MOUTH.
AND I THINK THICK WIRE...
THEY ACTUALLY...
THEY CAN FEEL THAT
WHEN THEY'RE CHOMPING ON IT.
AND I THINK A TREBLE HOOK,
AS WELL...
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A NICE,
SOFT, SUCCULENT BIT OF FISH,
AND THERE'S...
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE.
""NOW, WHAT'S THAT?""
AND I THINK
THEY CAN SPIT IT OUT.
SO, I'M USING A SINGLE HOOK.
AND THE THING ABOUT THAT...
IT CAN JUST FOLD DOWN NICELY.
IT'S NOT STICKING OUT LIKE...
YOU KNOW, THREE POINTS ON IT.
BOTH MARK AND I CAST LINES INTO THE RIVER,
BUT IT'S THE BAIT ON THE SINGLE HOOK
THAT GETS PICKED UP.
SOMETHING'S GOT IT.
IT'S MOVING.
IT'S MOVING AROUND TO THE LEFT.
IS IT?
YEAH, IT IS.
I NEED TO LET THE LINE RUN VERY
FREELY TO AVOID THE FISH REALIZING
THE BAIT'S ATTACHED
TO ANYTHING.
SOMETHING'S TAKEN OFF.
IT'S ON THE END.
IT'S STOPPED.
IT'S OFF AGAIN.
HE'S OFF AGAIN.
REALLY?
YEAH, REALLY.
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S THE LINE.
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S GONNA BE VERY SOON.
YEAH.
OH, I THINK IT'S OFF.
AW.
OH, NO. NO, NO.
NO, NO.
IT'S COMING TOWARD US.
THAT'S A SMALL... I THINK IT'S
A TURTLE OR A SMALL FISH.
IT'S COMING IN
VERY EASILY.
OR IT'S A LITTLE GAR.
IS THAT A NEEDLE NOSE?
LOOK AT THAT GREEDY THING,
THAT GREEDY THING.
AH!
THIS GATOR GAR HAS EYES
BIGGER THAN ITS STOMACH.
BUT AT THREE FEET LONG,
IT'S A CHANCE FOR ME TO TEST
WHETHER THESE FISH HAVE
AN AGGRESSIVE CHARACTER.
RIGHT.
THEY GROW 18 INCHES
THEIR FIRST YEAR.
SO IT'S PROBABLY, YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN A YEAR AND TWO.
THAT TONGUE'S INTERESTING,
ISN'T IT?
YEAH.
THERE'S THOSE TWO ROWS OF...
OF TEETH ON THE TOP.
THESE TEETH
ARE 3/8 OF AN INCH LONG,
1/4 OF THE LENGTH OF THOSE
OF A FULLY GROWN GATOR GAR.
UNH!
THAT'S IT.
OH, MY GOD,
YOU GOT BIT, HUH?
I WAS JUST IN THERE
TRYING TO GET THE HOOK OUT.
SCORE ONE FOR THE FISH.
YEAH.
THAT'S A VERY YOUNG ALLIGATOR
GAR WITH A BIG APPETITE.
I'M JUST GONNA LOB HIM BACK
IN THE WATER... WHOOPS!
BACK IN THE WATER.
MY IDEA THAT THE GAR IS
JUST A MISUNDERSTOOD,
BIG, UGLY, STUPID FISH
HAS CAUGHT ME OUT.
MAYBE IT DOES DESERVE
ITS REPUTATION, AFTER ALL.
THIS FISH HAS ACTUALLY STILL GOT
A LOT OF ENERGY LEFT.
I BROUGHT IT IN
ON VERY HEAVY GEAR.
SO IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A LOT
OF ENERGY LEFT.
NORMALLY THEY'D BE
PRETTY TIRED OUT.
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
SLIDE HIM OVER THE SIDE,
WELL AHEAD
OF OUR NEXT FISHING SPOT.
SO, HERE WE GO.
BACK YOU GO.
EVEN A FISH THIS SMALL
HAS MANAGED TO DRAW BLOOD.
GOOD BATTLE SCARS.
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE SORT OF...
THE CUT ON IT.
THIS IS A SETBACK TO MY THEORY THAT THE
GATOR GAR MAY HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY BLAMED
FOR THESE VIOLENT ATTACKS.
THE CONSEQUENCES, IF THIS FISH WERE
SCALED UP TO A MONSTROUS 8 TO 10 FEET,
ARE BEGINNING TO HIT HOME.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A GAR THAT SIZE WITH
TEETH TO MATCH AND A BODY LIKE A TORPEDO,
IT REALLY IS
A TERRIFYING PROSPECT.
YOU'VE JUST GOT A LIVING
WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION.
THAT WAS JUST A GENTLE BRUSH
WITH ITS TEETH.
OKAY, IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY DEEP,
BUT THEY CERTAINLY DREW BLOOD.
WHOOPS!
BACK IN THE WATER.
YET THIS ALLIGATOR GAR
IS ONLY THREE FEET LONG.
AAH!
GEORGE GRAINGER REPORTED THAT WHAT
BIT HIS SISTER WAS SEVEN FEET LONG.
AND OTHER REPORTS STATE THAT THESE
FISH CAN REACH DOUBLE THAT LENGTH.
NOW, I HAVE SEEN ONE
14 FOOT LONG DOWN THERE.
ITS REPUTATION FOR VICIOUS ATTACKS ON
HUMANS IS BEGINNING TO APPEAR JUSTIFIED.
IT'S NO WONDER
THAT PEOPLE TOOK FRIGHT
WHEN YOU CONSIDER
A BEAST OF THOSE DIMENSIONS
WITH A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.
BUT I STILL DON'T HAVE
HARD PROOF.
I BELIEVE
THE JURY IS STILL OUT.
IN PAST TIMES, FOR MANY OF THOSE
LIVING IN THE DEEP SOUTH,
THIS WAS A FISH
GUILTY AS CHARGED,
ONE THAT SHOULD BE ERADICATED
FROM ALL RIVERS AND LAKES.
SO, THEY TOOK IT
REALLY SERIOUSLY, THEN,
THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF ""LET'S CLEAR
THESE THINGS OUT OF THE WATER.""
""THEY'RE... YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE AN ABOMINATION.
THEY'RE NOT FIT TO SORT OF
SHARE THE PLANET WITH US.""
THEY OBVIOUSLY LOOK GUILTY.
THEREFORE, THEY MUST BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THESE OCCASIONAL INSTANCE
WHERE SOMEONE GETS
THEIR LEG BITTEN OR WHATEVER.
BUT... BUT...
BUT WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE?
BASICALLY, THEY LOOK SCARY,
AND SO THAT ADDED TO PEOPLE
JUST WANTING TO RUN THEM
OUT OF TOWN.
AND SO THEY WERE
RUN OUT OF TOWN.
I MEAN, I HEARD OF, YOU KNOW, JUST SORT
OF HEAPS OF THEM UP IN THE... YOU KNOW.
YEAH, BULLDOZERED PILES, LOTS
OF PEOPLE SHOOTING THEM,
JUST A VERY DESPISED,
HATED FISH.
IN 1933, THE TEXAS GAME FISH COMMISSION
BEGAN A CAMPAIGN OF EXTERMINATION.
THEY BUILT
AN ELECTRIC GAR DESTROYER,
RIGGED WITH A 200-VOLT
ELECTRIC NET TO KILL THE FISH.
OVER THE NEXT THREE DECADES,
MILLIONS OF GAR WERE DESTROYED,
IN AN EFFORT
TO BE RID OF THEM FOREVER.
PERHAPS THE PREJUDICE THAT THE
ALLIGATOR GAR HAS ALWAYS SUFFERED
EXPLAINS THE EXTREME FISHING
METHODS USED TO CATCH THEM TODAY.
UNLESS THEY GET THE PROTECTION
THEY NEED TO REACH FULL SIZE,
GIANT ALLIGATOR GAR
MAY WELL BE WIPED OUT.
NOW IN TEXAS, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
THE PARKS AND WILDLIFE AUTHORITIES
ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT THE COST
HAS BEEN TO THE GAR POPULATION.
ON THE LOWER TRINITY, WE'RE EN ROUTE
TO SET WHAT ARE CALLED JUGLINES,
BAITED HOOKS
ATTACHED TO FLOATS.
OUR PLAN IS TO CATCH AS MANY
GATOR GAR AS POSSIBLE
AND THEN MONITOR THEM
WITH ELECTRONIC TAGS.
DR. DAVE BUCKMEIER
LEADS THIS PROJECT.
DAVE, WHAT'S THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE
ON THE GAR AT THE MOMENT?
ALLIGATOR GAR, ALONG WITH OTHER
GARS AND BUFFALO AND THINGS,
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED
KIND OF ROUGH FISH,
WHICH NO ONE REALLY
CARED MUCH ABOUT.
IS THAT THE SAME
AS TRASH FISH?
""TRASH FISH"" WOULD BE
ANOTHER COMMON NAME FOR IT.
AND SO THERE WAS ACTUALLY EVEN EFFORTS
TO TRY AND ERADICATE ALLIGATOR GAR
AND OTHER GARS
FROM POPULATIONS
'CAUSE THEY WERE BELIEVED TO HAVE
EATEN DESIRABLE FISH, IF YOU WILL,
LARGEMOUTH BASS AND THINGS
THAT WE HAVE, CATFISH.
THEY HAVE RECENTLY BEEN LISTED AS VULNERABLE
BY THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN MOST STATES
THEY'RE DEFINITELY ON THE DECLINE.
YEAH.
SO, WE HAVE SOME REAL REASONS FOR
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS SPECIES.
SHALL I CHUCK THIS OUT?
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
THROW THAT ONE OUT THERE.
AND IT UNWINDS ITSELF,
DOES IT?
YEAH, THEY JUST...
AS THE BAIT SINKS, IT'LL UNWIND.
AND THEN THAT LIES ON THE BOTTOM AND JUST...
RIGHT, AND THAT LIES ON THE BOTTOM,
AND WHEN THE GAR COME UP TO FEED THEY'LL
KIND OF COMB THE BOTTOM, PICK UP THE BAIT,
AND USUALLY RUN WITH IT
FOR 15, 20 MINUTES.
AND AFTER WE'RE CONFIDENT THEY'VE
SWALLOWED IT, WE'LL GO PICK UP THE BAIT.
IT'S SPINNING NICELY THERE.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONE TO REST.
NOT MUCH RESEARCH HAS YET BEEN DONE,
BUT IT'S THOUGHT FEW GATOR GAR
REACH THEIR MAXIMUM LIFE-SPAN
OF 60 YEARS.
AS WE MOVE ON
TO SET MORE LINES,
THERE'S A CALL FROM
THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE RIVER.
WE'VE ACTUALLY JUST PUT OUT
SOME JUGLINES AND NETS,
BUT SOME LOCAL GUYS HERE...
THEY'VE GOT A TROTLINE OUT,
A LINE GOING ACROSS THE RIVER
WITH HOOKS AT INTERVALS.
AND THEY'VE JUST PULLED
A SMALL GAR OUT ON THAT.
SO, THE FIRST FISH
ACTUALLY NOW IS GONNA BE TAGGED,
AND THEN
ALL THE MEASUREMENTS TAKEN.
930,
AND 78 IS THE TAG NUMBER.
THE TAG WILL PROVIDE
THE BIOLOGISTS WITH DATA
ABOUT WHICH AREAS OF THE TRINITY
RIVER THE GAR ARE USING
SO THEY CAN FORMULATE A PLAN
TO PROTECT THE SPECIES.
SOUNDS LIKE A VISIT TO THE DENTIST
BUT ACTUALLY QUITE APPROPRIATE
BECAUSE THE SCALES OF THESE THINGS ARE
VERY... MADE OF SOMETHING CALLED GANOIN,
WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR
TO TOOTH ENAMEL.
SO, HENCE THE NEED FOR A DRILL,
JUST TO PENETRATE THAT BODY ARMOR.
ENGINEERED LIKE MEDIEVAL CHAIN MAIL,
THE GAR'S SUIT OF ARMOR IS BUILT
FROM THICK, DIAMOND-SHAPED SCALES, PROVIDING
A FORMIDABLE DEFENSE AGAINST ATTACK.
THEY'RE SO HARD THAT NATIVE
AMERICANS USED THEM FOR ARROWHEADS.
AND THE FISH...
I CAN'T EVEN FEEL IT TENSING.
IT'S JUST LYING HERE VERY, VERY CALMLY, WET
TOWEL OVER IT... OVER THE EYES, AS WELL.
THAT HAS JUST COME OUT
OF A VERY MUDDY RIVER,
WHERE IT CAN'T SEE MUCH
INTO THE BRIGHT LIGHT.
UNLIKE MY LAST EXPERIENCE, THIS YOUNG
GAR DISPLAYS NO AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR.
IF YOU'LL READ THAT NUMBER,
THE TOP NUMBER.
OKAY, THIS IS 44433?
WE'RE GONNA JUST
LET THAT ONE GO.
OKAY.
THE GAR IS RELEASED UNHARMED.
OHH!
I GUESS HE WANTED TO GO.
HE WANTED TO GO.
THE ELECTRONIC TAG WILL NOW SEND A
SIGNAL TO A SERIES OF RECEIVERS
TO MONITOR
THE FISH'S MOVEMENTS.
AFTER SEVERAL HOURS, THE SCIENTISTS'
OWN SEARCH IS FINALLY SUCCESSFUL.
NOTHING ON THE JUGLINES, BUT ONE
CAUGHT IN A NET... A TWO-FOOT GAR.
THERE ARE NO SIGNS
OF ANY MONSTER-SIZED FISH.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE POPULATION OF THESE
FISH IS IN A WORSE STATE THAN I THOUGHT.
MAYBE IN THE OLD DAYS, WHEN THESE
FISH WERE LITERALLY EVERYWHERE,
CRUDE TECHNIQUES WOULD WORK.
BUT NOW I THINK I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO DEVELOP AN APPROACH
THAT IS MORE PRECISE
AND TARGETED.
I'M DETERMINED TO GET
FACE-TO-FACE WITH A GIANT GAR
AND FIND OUT THE TRUTH BEHIND
ITS MONSTROUS REPUTATION.
I'M HEADING FOR THE AQUARIUM
IN ATHENS, TEXAS,
WHERE CURATOR WAYNE HEATON
KEEPS SOME GATOR GAR.
I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
THE BUSINESS END OF THESE FISH,
JUST WHAT EXACTLY THEIR TEETH
ARE CAPABLE OF.
I THINK, AS FAR AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
CONCERNED, THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO A SHARK.
AND IT'S IN FRESHWATER.
IT'S IN A RIVER NEAR YOU.
YOU KNOW? SORT OF,
""DON'T GO IN THE WATER.""
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH US, ESPECIALLY IF
IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT,
WE ALWAYS ASSUME THE WORST.
AND SO YOU SEE A BIG 6-, 7-, 8-FOOT GAR HIT
THE SURFACE WITH THESE MONSTROUS TEETH,
THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND
IS, ""WELL, I'M NOT GETTING IN THE WATER.""
WELL, YOU KNOW,
AND THESE TEETH...
THEY'RE NOT LIKE OUR TEETH.
THEY'RE NOT KIND OF BLUNT.
YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF HAVE A FEW
SHARP ONES FOR TEARING OR WHATNOT.
THESE THINGS ARE MADE TO... WHENEVER
THEY GRAB SOMETHING, IT'S THEIRS.
AND SO THESE TEETH
ARE VERY, VERY SHARP.
I WONDER IF PERHAPS
THEY'RE A BIT SIMPLE-MINDED
AND THEY'RE JUST SORT OF PROGRAMMED...
EVEN IF IT WAS DEAD,
THEY'RE STILL PROGRAMMED
TO SORT OF LIKE KEEP IT CLAMPED
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE PROPERLY SWALLOWING IT.
WHEN THEY GRAB IT, THEY
KIND OF WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO SWALLOW.
SO, YOU MIGHT SEE THEM
HOLD IT FOR A MINUTE
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.
AND ONCE THEY DECIDE TO EAT IT, YOU'LL
START SEE THEM MOVING IT IN THEIR MOUTH,
AND THEN TO THE POINT WHERE
THEY'LL ACTUALLY SWALLOW IT.
BUT THEN, ONCE IT'S THERE... EVEN
THOUGH IT'S A BIG MOUTH, IT'S...
YOU KNOW, THAT PROCESS SEEMS
TO BE QUITE A SLOW PROCESS.
RIGHT. THEY WILL DO IT
AT THEIR LEISURE.
THEY'RE IN NO HURRY BECAUSE ONCE
THEY HAVE THAT IN THEIR MOUTH,
THEY KNOW
IT'S NOT GOING NOWHERE.
SO, IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S GOT QUITE A BIT OF FIGHT,
THEY'LL JUST KEEP
THAT MOUTH CLOSED
UNTIL IT WEARS ITSELF OUT
TO WHERE THEY CAN SWALLOW IT.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SOMETHING IN
THE WATER TO TRY TO FIND THE GAR.
YOU'RE BASICALLY GONNA
LET THAT GAR COME TO YOU.
AND HE'S GONNA GRAB IT.
AND SO WHEN HE GRABS IT, YOU MIGHT
NOT WANT TO TRY TO SET THE HOOK
RIGHT WHEN HE GRABS IT BECAUSE
HE MIGHT BE STILL DECIDING
WHETHER HE WANTS IT
OR NOT.
BUT ONCE HE GETS TO WHERE
HE WANTS TO SWALLOW IT
AND THEN YOU SET THE HOOK,
YOU BETTER BE STRAPPED IN.
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I NEED
A CAUTIOUS, PATIENT APPROACH,
I HIRE ANOTHER FISHING GUIDE,
MARK MALFA,
TO TAKE ME TO A FRESH SECTION
OF THE TRINITY RIVER.
MY PLAN... TO HOLD OFF
SETTING THE HOOK
UNTIL I'M SURE THE GATOR GAR
HAS PROPERLY TAKEN THE BAIT.
THAT WAS DEFINITELY A FISH
MOVING OFF.
MM-HMM, FOR SURE.
NOT A DAMN THING.
THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY,
VERY FRUSTRATING FISHING.
I MEAN, SOMETHING DEFINITELY
HAD THAT IN ITS MOUTH
'CAUSE IT MOVED IT
SEVERAL YARDS.
BUT WHEN I TIGHTEN DOWN,
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
AND REALLY, YOU KNOW, JUST
TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO FISH HERE,
THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT ANYBODY'S
TOLD ME THAT'S ANY USE.
I MEAN, VERY FEW PEOPLE
FISH FOR THESE.
BOBBY FLY CAUGHT HIS
BY ACCIDENT.
AND THE FISHING THAT IS DONE
ON ROD AND LINE IS PRETTY BASIC.
YOU KNOW, IT DOES WORK.
IT'S A FAIRLY LOW-PERCENTAGE
SUCCESS RATE.
YOU CHUCK OUT A LUMP OF DEAD
FISH LIKE THIS AND YOU WAIT
AND YOU LET IT TAKE IT
FOR A LONG TIME.
AND MOST TIMES YOU TIGHTEN DOWN,
THERE'S NOTHING ON THE END,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES THERE IS,
AND IT HASN'T REALLY GOT ANY
MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT.
BUT THAT WAS ANOTHER HALF-HOUR WITH
NOTHING TO SHOW AT THE END OF IT.
BUT FOCUSED ON MY TARGET,
I FISH ON, TOWARDS DUSK.
WHAT DO YOU RECKON...
TIGHTEN DOWN?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
NORMALLY, GAR ARE CAUGHT BEFORE
THE WATER BEGINS TO COOL DOWN,
WELL BEFORE THE SUN SETS.
THAT'S GONE OFF.
IT'S GONE OFF AGAIN.
MOST GUIDES GIVE UP FISHING
BY MIDAFTERNOON.
SET IT. SET IT.
SET IT. SET IT. SET IT.
THERE WE GO.
THAT'S IT.
PLEASE BE ON IT.
YOU FEEL SOMETHING?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S A FISH.
OH, YES!
YES!
WHOO-HOO!
OH, IT'S GONE UNDER THE BOAT, UNDER THE
BOAT, UNDER THE BOAT, UNDER THE BOAT.
JUST KEEP THE TIP AWAY.
THAT SOAKED ME.
I'M HERE, 4 FEET ABOVE THE
WATER, AND I GOT A SPLASHING.
YES!
FINALLY IT SEEMS I AM GOING TO GET
FACE-TO-FACE WITH MY RIVER MONSTER. WHOO!
I'M HOOKED INTO MY TARGET, A RIVER
MONSTER WITH A FEARSOME REPUTATION...
THE ALLIGATOR GAR.
IT'S PULLING DOWN.
IT'S PULLING DOWN.
LOOK AT THAT ROD TIP.
LET'S GET HIM UP.
LET'S GET HIM UP.
AFTER FISHING FOR 12 HOURS STRAIGHT,
JUST AS DUSK TURNS TO NIGHT,
I SET MY EYES
ON THE GIANT FISH.
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT?
THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF GAR FISHING
IS BRINGING THE FISH ABOARD THE BOAT.
COMING OVER.
OH, THERE WE GO!
THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED.
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE WANTED.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED.
THAT'S A PROPER-SIZED FISH.
AS THE GAR COMES ABOARD, IT THRASHES ITS
SNOUT FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIKE A SCYTHE.
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
THAT 3-FOOTER THAT GOT ME.
THIS FISH
IS ALMOST 7 FEET LONG.
SINGLE HOOK.
SINGLE HOOK.
SINGLE HOOK, SINGLE HOOK.
YEAH!
WE'VE DONE IT.
WE'VE DONE IT.
FANTASTIC, MARK.
THAT WAS REALLY... OOH.
UNH! UNH! UNH!
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
OKAY.
YOU GOT THE GAFF HANDLE?
YES.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, THIS WILL GO IN HERE.
OKAY.
THE TEETH OF THIS GAR
ARE ANOTHER HALF-INCH LONGER
THAN THOSE
THAT SCARRED ME EARLIER.
IT'S 123, 123 POUNDS.
GOOD, GOOD.
GOOD, GOOD.
YES.
FINALLY GETTING MY HANDS ON THE
FISH AND SEEING IT FACE-TO-FACE,
I CAN BEGIN TO WEIGH UP
THE EVIDENCE.
ACTUALLY LAYING HANDS
ON THIS PREHISTORIC BEAST.
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
I MEAN, THIS IS THE CREATURE
THAT I CAME HERE TO SEE.
I MEAN, YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY...
LIKE MARK...
THAT THESE THINGS...
THEY WON'T JUST DEVOUR A BAIT.
THEY WILL JUST...
THEY'RE SO FIDDLY, THOUGH.
THEY WILL JUST SIT AND CHEW IT AND...
MAYBE SPIT IT OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD FISH
TAKE 100 YARDS OF LINE, EVEN.
IN 15, 20 MINUTES, YOU TIGHTEN DOWN,
AND THERE'S JUST NOTHING ON THE END.
GAR DON'T BITE PIECES
OFF THEIR PREY.
THEY ONLY EAT
WHAT THEY CAN SWALLOW WHOLE.
THIS PUTS HUMANS
OFF THE MENU.
FOR ALL THIS FIERCE REPUTATION,
YOU KNOW, THEY DO SEEM TO BE...
YOU KNOW,
THEY CERTAINLY LOOK THE PART,
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY
ACTUALLY ACT UP TO THE PART.
OOH, WHAT A THING,
WHAT AN ANIMAL.
THIS GATOR GAR SEEMS TOO GENTLE-NATURED
TO CAUSE DELIBERATE HARM.
INTERESTING
THAT HERE'S THE BAIT.
YOU KNOW,
IT HASN'T TAKEN IT DOWN.
THE BAIT IS... OH, THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO.
YEAH, GIRL, DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE GOING BACK IN THE WATER
IN A MOMENT.
MAYBE WE'LL THROW THAT AFTERWARDS
AS A LITTLE CONSOLATION.
BUT THAT WAS INTERESTING...
WHEN IT JUST DID THAT,
THE WHOLE UPPER JAW
SORT OF EXPANDED, DIDN'T IT?
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT ACTUALLY
CAME UP AND GULPED.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE GAPS WHERE
THERE'S ACTUALLY FLESH IN BETWEEN,
AND THE HEAD'S
ALLOWED TO EXPAND.
RIGHT THROUGH THESE TWO LITTLE VEINS RIGHT
THROUGH HERE AND UP THROUGH HERE...
YOU SEE THAT SEPARATION
OF THE JAW?
THAT ACTUALLY GIVES.
THERE'S FLESH IN BETWEEN THESE AREAS,
AS WELL AS UP IN THROUGH HERE.
SEE THAT?
THIS IS SOLID, SOLID.
RIGHT HERE'S FLESH
THAT ATTACHES THE JOINTS.
SO IT ALLOWS THE HEAD
TO FLEX AND MOVE.
THE SKIN THAT JOINS THESE ARMORED PLATES
ALLOWS THE GAR'S JAW TO EXPAND...
BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT IT COULD CONSUME
A PERSON OR EVEN A HUMAN LIMB.
IT'S VERY TEMPTING JUST TO KEEP
IT OUT AND ADMIRE IT, YOU KNOW?
BUT I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT...
ALTHOUGH THIS ANIMAL IS AN AIR BREATHER,
I THINK IT IS VERY MUCH TIME
TO GET IT BACK IN.
SO, I THINK ONE LAST LOOK,
AND BACK IN THE WATER.
UP. OHH!
LET'S SEE HOW IT'S DOING.
OKAY, YOU GOT IT?
OKAY.
IT'S VERY HARD TO HOLD.
AND YOU GOT THE HEAVIER END.
I'VE GOT THE HEAVY END.
I'VE GOT THE BONY END.
THIS FEMALE GATOR GAR
MEASURES 6'8"".
SHE'S LONGER THAN I AM TALL.
THEN, ONCE AGAIN,
THE GAR DRAWS BLOOD.
SHE HAS A 14-INCH-LONG MOUTH,
FULL OF SOME 500 TEETH.
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE TEETH
OF THE ANIMAL, THOUGH, IS IT?
THAT IS THE BACK OF A SCALE
OR SOME SCALES.
SLICING ACROSS YOUR... YEAH,
AS THE FISH... MY HAND...
WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE FISH ON MY
FOREARM THERE, THE FISH JUST SLID BACK.
SLIDING THAT WAY IS FINE.
SLIDING THIS WAY,
THE POINTS...
THE REAR POINTS OF THESE
TRIANGULAR SCALES STUCK IN.
THE NATIVE AMERICANS USED TO USE THEM AS
ARROWHEADS, AND I CAN SORT OF SEE WHY NOW.
I'VE GOT A BIG, OLD SCRAPE DOWN
MY ARM THERE FROM THE SCALES.
ANYWAY, SHOULD WE GET, UH... I BELIEVE
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE GAR'S NAME.
YOU'VE GOT THAT, YEAH?
IT'S TIME TO RETURN
THE SPECIMEN TO THE WILD
AND REFLECT
ON OTHER POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.
OKAY.
LIFT THAT.
OKAY.
BYE-BYE, BABY.
THERE IT GOES.
THERE IT GOES.
EXCELLENT.
WOW.
HAS THE CLUE BEEN THERE ALL ALONG, IN
THE VERY NAME THE ALLIGATOR GAR SHARES
WITH ANOTHER PREDATOR?
IF YOU PUT LEGS ON THAT, IT WOULD
JUST BE LIKE AN ALLIGATOR.
IT WOULD GET UP AND WALK.
IS THE REAL CULPRIT THE ANIMAL IT COULD
SO EASILY BE MISTAKEN FOR... AAH!
THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR?
AFTER YEARS OF ONE-SIDED TESTIMONY, IT'S
TIME FOR THE JURY TO REVIEW THE VERDICT
ON THE GUILT OF THE GATOR GAR.
THERE MUST BE A MORE LOGICAL
CULPRIT FOR THE MANY INCIDENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN BLAMED
ON THE GAR.
IN THE SAME RIVERS AND LAKES
THAT THEY INHABIT,
THERE ARE ALSO
MANY AMERICAN ALLIGATORS.
NOT ONLY DO THEY SHARE THE SAME HABITATS...
THEY HAVE SIMILAR TEETH.
THEIR SIZE AND THE PROFILE
OF THEIR SNOUTS
COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED,
ONE FOR THE OTHER.
I'VE COME TO THIS ALLIGATOR PARK
IN SOUTHERN TEXAS
TO GET A LOOK
AT SOME OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS
THAT SHARE THE WATER
WITH THE ALLIGATOR GAR
'CAUSE I'VE GOT A SNEAKING
FEELING THAT, ACTUALLY,
THE ALLIGATOR GAR HAS TAKEN
THE RAP FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
AND IT COULD BE
THESE CHARACTERS HERE.
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS GET A FAIRLY CLOSE LOOK
AT THE EQUIPMENT
OF THE ALLIGATOR.
AND WHAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD WOULD BE
TO ACTUALLY SEE THEM IN ACTION, AS WELL.
BUT I THINK THAT PART OF IT
IS PROBABLY BEST LEFT TO GARY.
GARY SAURAGE IS A KEY WITNESS
FOR THE GAR'S DEFENSE.
HE UNDERSTANDS
THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOR OF A FISH
AND AN ALLIGATOR.
YOU CAN IMAGINE AN ANIMAL LIKE THIS WOULD
HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING A FULL-GROWN MAN.
THEY'RE SNEAKY.
THEY'RE TREMENDOUSLY PATIENT.
AND THESE ANIMALS RIGHT HERE...
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY DEATHS
THEY'RE REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
EVERY YEAR.
THIS IS THE APEX HUNTER IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RIGHT HERE.
LET'S SAY IT'S A HOT SUMMER DAY.
YOU DECIDE YOU'RE GONNA DIP YOUR
FEET IN THE WATER A LITTLE BIT.
THEY'RE DANGLING DOWN, AND...
WOW!... THEY COME ON UP AND HIT.
WHEN THE ALLIGATOR'S HUNTING HIS PREY,
HE'LL SHOOT UP OUT OF THE WATER,
AND THEY'LL GRAB
WHATEVER LIMB HE CAN GET.
AND ON THE WAY DOWN,
HE'LL DO A DEATH ROLL.
AND IF YOU WERE TO RESIST THAT,
IT'S WHATEVER LIMB HE GETS,
WHETHER IT BE HAND, FINGER,
OR TOES, IT'S COMING OFF.
THE ALLIGATOR GAR
DOESN'T HAVE NEAR THE PRESSURE.
THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR CAN BITE DOWN
WITH 3,000 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.
AND I'M SURE MANY, MANY TIMES
FOLKS MAY THINK
THAT IT'S AN ALLIGATOR GAR ON A BAD BITE,
BUT YOU CAN REST ASSURED IT'S NOT.
IT'S NORMALLY
THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR.
GAR HAVE NEITHER THE POWER
NOR THE ATTITUDE
FOR PREMEDITATED
VIOLENT ATTACKS ON HUMANS.
ALLIGATOR GAR DON'T CHEW.
SO THEY ONLY EAT STUFF BIG ENOUGH
THAT THEY CAN SWALLOW WHOLE.
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE
OF THE GAR,
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SIZE
THE FOOD ITEM THAT THEY'LL EAT.
BUT A GOOD 6- TO 8-FOOT GAR COULD VERY
EASILY TAKE OUT A 12- TO 14-INCH FISH.
I'M LEFT IN LITTLE DOUBT THAT MANY OF
THE ATTACKS ATTRIBUTED TO GATOR GAR
ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE THE
WORK OF THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR.
I'VE HEARD ALL THESE MYTHS
ABOUT THE ALLIGATOR GAR,
YOU KNOW, RIPPING PEOPLE'S LEGS
OFF, CHOPPING ALLIGATORS IN HALF,
GENERALLY TERRORIZING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS, SINCE
HAVING COME HERE AND SPOKEN TO PEOPLE
WHO ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS FISH AND
HAVING SPENT SOME TIME MYSELF ON THE RIVER,
I'VE GOT THIS IDEA THAT IT'S
ACTUALLY JUST GOT A BAD P.R. AGENT.
I THINK
IT'S A BIT OF A PUSSYCAT.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT HERE IS A TANK
WITH SOME VERY BIG ALLIGATOR GAR IN,
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY MY CHANCE
TO TEST MY THEORY FOR MYSELF.
I'VE BEEN AT THE SHARP END
OF A 3-FOOT GATOR GAR'S TEETH.
WHOOPS!
BACK IN THE WATER.
I'VE FELT THE MUSCLE POWER HELD IN THE
SERPENTINE BODY ""OF A 6'8"" MONSTER.
IT'S 123, 123 POUNDS.
BUT NOW I'VE GOT
TO WALK THE TALK.
I'VE GOT TO VENTURE INTO
THE GAR'S OWN UNDERWATER WORLD.
NONE OF THE GAR SHOW
ANY INTENT TO HARM ME.
IN MY VIEW, IT'S THE ALLIGATOR GAR
ITSELF THAT HAS BEEN THE VICTIM.
IT'S AMAZING TO GET THIS CLOSE.
THIS FISH REALLY IS A MIRACLE
OF EVOLUTION, A TRUE SURVIVOR.
BUT IF ANYONE IS GONNA SEE
THE REAL GIANTS,
THIS FISH NEEDS TO BE ALLOWED
TO GROW WITHOUT PERSECUTION.
MAYBE THEN WE'LL GET TO SEE
THOSE 14-FOOTERS AGAIN.
THAT WAS... THAT... THAT WAS...
THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE.
OHH. I HAVE TO SAY, THE SIZE... THE SIZE
AND THE ASPECT OF THOSE FISH, THOUGH,
WHEN I FIRST SAW THEM,
WAS REALLY QUITE INTIMIDATING.
BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY, VERY MISUNDERSTOOD
ANIMAL, AND I THINK IT REALLY IS TIME
THAT WE JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND
THIS FISH A LITTLE BIT BETTER.","Bagarius yarrelli, also known as the goonch catfish, giant devil catfish, or simply Goonch, is a very large species of catfish in the genus Bagarius found in rivers in the Indian subcontinent. The species reaches up to 2 m (6.6 ft) in length. It may be synonymous with B. bagarius.


== Etymology ==
The species is known by many names throughout its range in the Indian subcontinent. It is known as the goonch in Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, baghar or baghair in Bengali and Bihari (these names being the origin of the genus name Bagarius), gauns in Rajasthani, gorua (গৰুৱা) and baghmas (বাঘমাছ) in Assamese and bodh in Chhattisgarhi. Its scientific name commemorates the English naturalist William Yarrell.


== Taxonomy ==
The species is frequently taxonomically confused with B. bagarius. B. bagarius has – perhaps in error – been reported as reaching the same size as B. yarrelli, while others consider B. bagarius to be a dwarf species that only reaches about 20 cm (7.9 in). A study published in 2021 found B. yarrelli to be a junior synonym of B. bagarius, likely necessitating a merge of B. yarrelli into B. bagarius.


== Distribution and habitat ==

It is found in large rivers in South Asia, such as the Indus and Ganges basins. It is more common in deeper pools near faster current, but never in small streams. Two other populations were also formerly thought to exist in Southeast Asia (one population in the Mekong-Chao Phraya basin and the other from the Xe Bang Fai of Laos south to Indonesia), but a 2021 study found the former to represent a new species B. vegrandis, and the latter to represent the distinct species B. lica, previously synonymized with B. yarrelli.


== Threats ==
While still abundant, the species is considered vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to excessive, unsustainable overharvesting of the species. Hydroelectric projects such as those on the Indravati River may affect the habitat of the species and adversely impact it.


== Cultural significance ==
The Order of the Fish was the highest honour of the Mughal Empire and named after this fish. 
In Chhattisgarh, the species is worshipped by tribal communities such as the Murias and Gonds, and is popularly referred to as the ""shark of the Bastar"". There have been efforts to name it the official state fish of Chhattisgarh.


== In captivity ==
Bagarius yarrelli has seldom been kept successful in a home aquarium setting. Some monster fish enthusiasts have attempted to house this species in home aquaria to varying degrees of success. Unlike some other larger catfish species such as the Sun Catfish or Pictus Catfish, Goonch Catfish will quickly outgrow even the largest systems, and are far more suited for an outdoor tropical pond setting or the largest of public aquaria displays. Despite this, juveniles are sometimes seen for sale at much smaller sizes around 4"" - 6"" in length to unexpecting buyers.  They are also a very aggressive species in the presence of most other fish, exhibiting territorial aggression and possessing two rows of larger, sharp, pointed teeth making them unsuitable for virtually any tankmates.

Alligator Gar,Alligator Gar,Atractosteus spatula,"MY NAME IS JEREMY WADE.
I'M AN EXPLORER, A BIOLOGIST,
AND A FISHERMAN.
LOOK AT THIS!
THERE IT IS!
I'VE CAUGHT MANY EXTRAORDINARY FISH FROM
RIVERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD... OH, OH, OH!
FISH THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED
AS REAL MONSTERS.
NORMALLY I HAVE TO TRAVEL HALFWAY 'ROUND
THE WORLD TO FIND MY QUARRY... HERE WE GO!
THE BIGGEST, SOME WOULD SAY BADDEST,
FRESHWATER FISH ON THE PLANET.
IT'S NOT OFTEN I HEAR OF A RIVER
MONSTER IN MY OWN BACKYARD...
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT'S HAPPENED.
A REPORT IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER
SAYS SWIMMERS ARE BEING ATTACKED
IN A LAKE OUTSIDE BERLIN.
THIS ISN'T A FAR-OFF,
EXOTIC PLACE.
A RIVER MONSTER WITHIN 10 MILES OF
A 21st-CENTURY EUROPEAN CAPITAL...
CAN IT REALLY BE TRUE?
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
NOT TO BE MISSED.
I'M ALREADY
PACKING MY EQUIPMENT.
I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS AS TO THE IDENTITY
OF THE CULPRIT, AND IF I'M RIGHT,
IT'S A FISH WITH A MONSTROUS REPUTATION,
CHRONICLED SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES.
THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!
THERE IT IS!
THE WELS IS EUROPE'S LARGEST FRESHWATER
FISH, CAPABLE OF REACHING OVER 200 POUNDS.
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH INTO THIS
PREDATORY MEMBER OF THE CATFISH FAMILY,
AND I'M FINDING THAT EVER SINCE RECORDS
BEGAN, EUROPE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD
ITS VERY OWN WELL-DOCUMENTED
FRESHWATER MAN-EATER.
IT APPEARS THE WELS CATFISH IS ACTUALLY
NO STRANGER TO MAKING FRONT-PAGE NEWS.
THERE ARE STORIES ABOUT THIS SPECIES
GOING BACK LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES
PORTRAYING IT
AS A MAN-EATING MONSTER.
I'VE BEEN DOING A BIT
OF RESEARCH.
QUITE FRANKLY, I HAD NO IDEA
IT HAD SUCH A REPUTATION.
BACK IN THE 1500s, A HUMAN HEAD
AND A HAND WITH A GOLD RING
WAS FOUND INSIDE THE STOMACH.
1630, THE CORPSE OF A 7-YEAR-OLD CHILD,
BODY OF A WOMAN, TWO GIRLS DEVOURED.
IT JUST GOES ON AND ON.
BUT ALL THIS
IS JUST SO TANTALIZING.
THERE ARE NO HARD FACTS
AND FIGURES
UNLESS, YOU KNOW,
YOU COUNT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IF THAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF YOUR
FRONT-PAGE STORY IN THE 16th CENTURY,
WOULD YOU GO IN THE WATER?
IT WOULD BE TOO EASY TO DISMISS THESE
TALES AS THE WORK OF SUPERSTITIOUS,
UNSCIENTIFIC MEDIEVAL MINDS.
ATTACKS AND HUMAN BODY PARTS
TURNING UP IN WELS' STOMACHS
HAVE BEEN REPORTED ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE,
FROM RUSSIA TO POLAND, THROUGH THE AGES
RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.
I RECENTLY CAME ACROSS THIS REPORT IN A
GERMAN NEWSPAPER OF SWIMMERS IN A LAKE
BEING ATTACKED BY WHAT IS THOUGHT
TO BE A LARGE WELS CATFISH.
I'M ON MY WAY TO GERMANY TO
INVESTIGATE THESE ATTACKS
AND MAYBE SOLVE THE MYSTERY
OF A SERIAL KILLER
WITH ITS ROOTS
IN EUROPE'S MEDIEVAL PAST.
GERMANY IS AT THE FOREFRONT
OF URBAN EXPANSION.
ALTHOUGH STEEPED IN HISTORY, IT
IS NOW COATED IN GLASS AND STEEL,
HARDLY THE PLACE
FOR A MAN-EATING MONSTER.
SCHLACHTENSEE IS A LAKE JUST 10
MINUTES FROM BERLIN'S CITY CENTER,
AND IT'S JUST BECOME
GERMANY'S VERY OWN LOCH NESS.
THIS IS WHERE
THE ATTACKS ARE HAPPENING.
OVER A MILE LONG
AND UP TO 700 FEET ACROSS,
THE LAKE WAS FORMED
IN THE LAST ICE AGE.
THESE COLD WATERS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN A REFUGE FOR WELS CATFISH,
AND FALLING TO OVER 25 FEET
IN PLACES,
IT'S PLENTY DEEP ENOUGH
TO HIDE AN ABSOLUTE MONSTER.
THE ATTACKS WERE LOCALIZED,
CONCENTRATED IN TWO SMALL AREAS.
STRANGELY, AREAS... ACCORDING
TO THE LOCAL FISHERMEN...
NOT TRADITIONALLY
THE PLACES TO HUNT FOR WELS.
SO, JUST WHAT HAPPENED?
I'M GOING TO ASK
ONE OF THE VICTIMS, JONAS FEI.
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DO
WHEN YOU CAME DOWN THAT DAY?
MAYBE TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO, I WAS
SWIMMING 10 OR 20 SECONDS OUT ON THE LAKE.
SUDDENLY,
SOMETHING BIG BIT ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT IT WAS A
VERY BIG SHOCK FOR ME... PAIN AND SHOCK.
IT HURTS VERY MUCH,
OF COURSE.
ALMOST EXACTLY HERE?
YES, RIGHT HERE.
IN A FRESHWATER LAKE SO FAR FROM THE
SEA, THE LAST THING YOU WOULD EXPECT
IS TO GET ATTACKED BY A FISH.
IT'S JUST NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN.
BEING BITTEN BY A WELS IS TO EXPERIENCE
THE POWER OF TWO HARD PLATES
PACKED WITH HUNDREDS
OF NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH.
HUGE JAW MUSCLES
CREATE A CRUSHING FORCE.
A BITE IS LIKE BEING GRABBED BY A
VISE COVERED IN COARSE SANDPAPER.
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED, YOU USED
TO QUITE ENJOY COMING HERE.
OF COURSE.
EVERY DAY I WOULD SWIM IN HERE, BUT
AFTER THAT, YEAH, I DON'T SWIM AGAIN.
NORMALLY ABOUT 100 OR 200 PEOPLE
ARE SWIMMING HERE.
SO, DEFINITELY PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN PUT OFF, YOU THINK?
YES, YES. OF COURSE.
YEAH?
BUT JONAS
WASN'T THE ONLY VICTIM.
IN ALMOST THE IDENTICAL PLACE, KATERINA
AND HER FRIEND CLARA HAD AN ENCOUNTER
THAT HAS SPOOKED THEM
OUT OF THE WATER FOR GOOD.
JUST ON A NORMAL SUMMER DAY, AND WE WANTED
TO SWIM A LITTLE BIT AND MEET FRIENDS,
SO WE WENT TO THE LAKE.
WE WERE SWIMMING IN THE WATER, JUST
TREADING WATER AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER,
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING SWIMMING AROUND OUR
LEGS, BUT WE COULDN'T REALLY DEFINE IT.
I THINK IT WAS LIKE
A SNAKE IN THE WATER.
YEAH.
THEN, SUDDENLY... THERE
WAS SOMETHING ON MY LEG.
THEN THERE WAS A... WOUND
ON MY LEG.
THERE WAS BLOOD.
THERE WERE TWO PARTS... THAT PART HERE,
AND THE OTHER ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH MY MOTHER.
THEY REACTED REALLY SHOCKED, THE
DOCTORS, BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
BEFORE.
AND THERE WERE OTHER ATTACKS,
THE SAME PATTERN EACH TIME...
SWIMMERS BITTEN ON THEIR LEGS, SENT
TERRIFIED OUT OF THE WATER, BLEEDING.
WILL THESE
21st-CENTURY ATTACKS PROVE
THAT THIS EUROPEAN RIVER
MONSTER IS NO MEDIEVAL MYTH?
WHAT I WANT TO FIND OUT
IS WHAT PROVOKED THESE ATTACKS,
AND ARE WELS CATFISH REALLY CAPABLE
OF WHAT THEY STAND ACCUSED OF?
LET'S HAVE THIS.
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON BELOW, I'M
WORKING WITH MY CAMERAMAN, SIMON,
AND A MINI SUBMARINE.
WE HAVE ALSO ENLISTED THE HELP OF DR.
CHRISTIAN WOLTER FROM THE BERLIN FISHERIES
TO GIVE ME AN EXPERT OPINION.
WE'RE HERE TO EXAMINE
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
AND SEE WHETHER KNOWLEDGE
OF THE BIOLOGY OF THE WELS
COULD EXPLAIN WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
TO TRIGGER SUCH AGGRESSION.
THAT'S ABOUT 10 METERS OUT,
ISN'T THAT?
THAT IS ABOUT WHERE THE BOY
SAID HE WAS ATTACKED.
WHAT WE COULD DO IS TAKE IT DOWN THERE...
JUST OVER A METER.
YEAH. YOU'RE STRAIGHT IN WEED
AT A METER DEPTH.
YEAH. THAT'S OKAY.
I'D HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D BE OUT OF YOUR DEPTH.
YOU COULD STAND UP IN THAT WATER,
COULDN'T YOU, ALMOST? YEAH.
SO, IT'S WEEDY AND SHALLOW,
BUT FOR DR. WOLTER,
THIS IS JUST THE INFORMATION HE NEEDS
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON.
THE WELS WERE JUST DOING WHAT EVERY PARENT
DOES... PROTECTING THEIR OFFSPRING.
THE SWIMMERS HAD TRESPASSED
INTO THEIR NURSERY.
SO, IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL OR UNUSUAL
ABOUT WHERE THEY TOOK BITES, DO YOU THINK?
IT'S A COMMON
SPAWNING PLACE.
THAT'S WHY IT MIGHT BE THE REASON WHY
IT OCCURRED SO CLOSE TO THE BANK.
THE PLACE THAT WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT THE ATTACKS HAPPENING,
THAT WOULD BE
A POTENTIAL SPAWNING PLACE?
CATFISH IS A PLANT SPAWNER.
THEY BUILD NESTS IN THE PLANTS
WHERE THEY LAY THEIR EGG,
AND THEN THEY GUARD
IN THERE.
THEN, IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION THAT
IT WAS DURING THE BREEDING TIME
THAT THEY HAD THE NESTS THERE,
WERE GUARDING THE NEST,
AND ATTACKED SOMETHING
WHICH COMES TOO CLOSE.
FOR THIS PARTICULAR CATFISH, IT WAS
A HUGE STRESS TO GUARD THE NEST
AND HAVE
ALL THOSE SWIMMERS AROUND.
SO IT WAS ACTUALLY
A PROVOKED ATTACK.
IT WAS PROTECTING THE NEST.
FRESHWATER CRAYFISH AND OTHER FISH
WILL EAT EGGS FROM AN UNGUARDED NEST.
TO PREVENT THIS, THE MALE CATFISH
SITS OVER ITS 300,000 YELLOW EGGS,
PROTECTING THEM FROM
ALL COMERS, LARGE OR SMALL.
THERE ARE TWO ESSENTIAL QUALITIES
THAT MAKE A MAN-EATER.
WELS CATFISH CERTAINLY HAVE THE ATTITUDE,
BUT DO THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY?
DO THEY LITERALLY
HAVE THE STOMACH FOR THE JOB?
AS A YOUNGER ANGLER, I CAUGHT SMALLER
WELS, BUT HOW BIG DO THEY NEED TO GET
TO POSE A SERIOUS THREAT
TO A HUMAN?
THERE'S NO POINT
FISHING OVER THE ATTACK SITES.
BREEDING IS OVER.
I'VE HOOKED UP WITH
LOCAL FISHERMAN HOSS STATUGY.
HE KNOWS WHERE THE WELS
ARE LIKELY TO BE NOW.
ME TOO.
BUT FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO GET
OVER THE LANGUAGE BARRIER.
YEAH. UM... UM... UM.
OH, HEY, RIGHT!
AH!
OH, I UNDERSTAND!
HE'S A BUTCHER. OKAY.
SO NOW JUST FISHING.
FISHING?
HUH? RIGHT.
OKAY.
ONE GLOVE, NO GOOD.
NOT ENOUGH.
ALWAYS WITH TWO.
ONE GLOVE, THE FISH CAN TWIST
AND TWIST YOU AROUND.
SO WE HAVE TWO GLOVES.
FINALLY, WITH THE BEST SPOTS PINPOINTED,
WE WANT TO START FISHING AT DUSK.
SO, THIS IS THE PLACE
TO FISH.
WELS ARE NIGHT STALKERS.
THEIR BODIES ARE BULGING
WITH SENSORY RECEPTORS.
THE LATERAL LINE THAT ALL FISH HAVE
ALLOWS THEM TO SENSE WATER VIBRATIONS,
BUT CATFISH ALSO HAVE
EXTRA RECEPTORS IN THEIR SKIN.
THOSE TENTACLES
ARE MORE THAN JUST FEELERS.
THEY CAN TASTE THE WATER
FOR SLIGHT CHEMICAL CHANGES,
ANY CLUE THAT LEADS THEM TO A MEAL, WHICH
CAN BE ANYTHING FROM FISH TO CRUSTACEANS,
EVEN WATER BIRDS.
WHEN YOU'RE UP AGAINST THESE SUPER SENSES,
FISHING GEAR FOR WELS NEEDS TO BE TOUGH,
BUT YOU ALSO NEED
A BIT OF DELICACY.
I'VE GOT VERY STRONG,
80-KILO BREAKING STRAIN,
BRAIDED LINE THERE, SO YOU CAN
LITERALLY JUST HANG ON.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET THEM
TAKE ANY LINE AT ALL.
YOU JUST HANG ON AND TRY AND STOP
THEM GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR THAT WOOD.
FLOAT THE SLIDES, BUT ONLY UP AS...
WHOOPS... ONLY UP AS FAR AS THE KNOT.
GOING DOWN
TO A FAIRLY BIG SINGLE HOOK.
AND SOMETHING ON THAT HOOK THAT
SMELLS TASTY, SO A DEAD FISH AS BAIT
SHOULD HOPEFULLY
DRAW A LARGE CATFISH IN.
THE SCHLACHTENSEE CATFISH PROVE ELUSIVE,
BUT MY TRIP HAS NOT BEEN WASTED.
I HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THESE FISH
HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE.
IT SEEMS THAT THESE ATTACKS IN BERLIN
WEREN'T PREDATORY IN THEIR INTENT
BUT DEFENSIVE, TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR AT
BREEDING TIME, BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY ACADEMIC
AS FAR AS THE VICTIMS
WERE CONCERNED.
THEY CAME AWAY WITH BLEEDING
WOUNDS ON THEIR LEGS,
WHICH UNDERLINES THE CHILLING TRUTH...
A LARGE WELS CATFISH
HAS BOTH THE SIZE AND THE FEARLESSNESS
TO BE A POTENTIAL MAN-EATER.
IF THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE I'M GONNA FIND
OUT JUST HOW BIG THE WELS CATFISH GROWS
AND HOW POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS IT IS, IT'S
HERE, THE RIO EBRO IN NORTHERN SPAIN.
THE FISH WAS INTRODUCED... IT'S BEEN
HERE A LITTLE MORE THAN 30 YEARS,
BUT IN THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
CATCHING FISH BIGGER THAN I AM.
I MEAN, THEY'RE GROWING MASSIVE.
SO, ALTHOUGH PART OF ME IS A LITTLE
BIT DUBIOUS ABOUT COMING HERE
BECAUSE IT IS AN ARTIFICIAL SITUATION,
I'M ALSO QUITE EXCITED BECAUSE I THINK
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
THAT, IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS,
I'M GONNA SEE A SERIOUSLY
BIG FISH ON THE END OF MY LINE.
NORTHERN SPAIN, THE RIVER EBRO.
IN 1974, A GERMAN SCIENTIST CAME HERE
AND RELEASED SOME WELS INTO THIS RIVER.
EVER SINCE, NOT ONLY HAVE THEY
GROWN IN NUMBERS BUT ALSO IN SIZE.
THE WELS HAS BECOME SPAIN'S
VERY OWN FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER.
THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY THE WELS
CATFISH ARE GROWING SO BIG IN THIS RIVER.
IT'S A MIXTURE OF MAN-MADE
AND NATURAL.
FOR A START, YOU'VE GOT THREE
OF THESE HUGE DAMS,
AND IT JUST MEANS THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
WATER, MORE SPACE FOR THE FISH TO LIVE IN.
ON TOP OF THAT,
THIS WATER IS HOT.
THE FISH,
BEING A COLD-BLOODED ANIMAL,
CAN JUST FEED AND GROW
FOR MORE MONTHS OF THE YEAR
THAN THEY DO IN EASTERN EUROPE
AND IN BERLIN.
THIS PLACE WAS STUFFED WITH FISH
ANYWAY, PARTICULARLY CARP.
THE ANGLERS ARE COMING IN.
THEY'RE THROWING IN
HUGE AMOUNTS OF BAIT
AND JUST SENDING THE WHOLE
SYSTEM INTO HYPERDRIVE.
THIS RIVER HAS A POLICY OF CATCH AND
RELEASE, SO EVERY YEAR, THE BIGGEST FISH
ARE EVEN BIGGER
THAN THE YEAR BEFORE.
MONSTERS OF OVER 200 POUNDS
ALREADY PROWL THESE WATERS.
WELS CAN LIVE TO 80 YEARS.
SUCH FISH ARE A MASSIVE LURE TO
FISHERMEN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
TO TEST JUST HOW VORACIOUS
THESE CATFISH ARE,
I HEAD INTO ONE OF THE EBRO'S
SWOLLEN TRIBUTARIES.
MY GUIDE TELLS ME THE FISH ARE
LURKING RIGHT IN AT THE MARGINS.
THEY'RE WAITING TO AMBUSH FISH
IN THE CURRENT
AND ALSO TO GRAB ANYTHING
THAT DROPS IN FROM THE BANKS.
VERY ENERGETIC, ACTIVE FISHING
THAT'S QUITE PRECISE, AS WELL.
ON THE MOVE, NOT SITTING AROUND,
WAITING, AND IT'S THE KIND OF FISHING
WHERE YOU'RE LEFT IN NO DOUBT
IF YOU'VE GOT A BITE.
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT, FEEL IT, HEAR IT, AS
SOMETHING JUST LAUNCHES ITSELF AT THIS
AND SORT OF WRENCHES ON THE ROD.
AH!
YES, YES, YES, YES!
WE'RE GOING DOWNSTREAM.
WATCH THE OAR.
WATCH THE OAR.
ALL RIGHT.
AAH!
GONE. GONE, GONE,
GONE, GONE. HEY.
I'M NOT DOING VERY WELL.
EVERYTHING'S HAPPENING
TOO QUICKLY.
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE I'D EXPECT
TO FIND A FAT, WALLOWING CATFISH,
BUT IT SHOWS HOW
YOU CAN MISJUDGE THESE GUYS.
I'M LEARNING THAT THERE'S MORE TO
WELS' BEHAVIOR THAN I THOUGHT.
AAH!
YES, YES, YES, YES, YES!
OPEN THE REEL!
OPEN THE REEL!
OFF, OFF, OFF, OFF, OFF.
IT'S OFF AGAIN.
AAH!
IT'S OFF!
LITERALLY TOOK
WITHIN ABOUT A SECOND
OF THE LURE HITTING THE WATER
ABOUT 6 INCHES FROM THE BANK.
THIS WATER IS CRACKING ALONG
AT SUCH A RATE.
THIS IS LIKE A FAST,
RUNNING PACE.
THAT'S THE PLACE.
LET IT SINK A LITTLE BIT
AND THEN TWITCH A LITTLE BIT.
YOU SEE THAT?
THAT'S COMING DIRECT.
THE FISH IS IN THE WATER,
WE LET IT SINK, AND POW.
ABSOLUTELY.
TWO STRIKES ON THAT FISH.
DAMN!
THE WELS HAVE MADE THEMSELVES TOTALLY AT
HOME HERE, NOT JUST IN THE MAIN CHANNELS
BUT THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE RIVER SYSTEM.
AS APEX PREDATORS, THEY HAVE A CONFIDENCE
THAT I'M ABOUT TO WITNESS FIRSTHAND.
THESE FISH ARE SCARED
OF NOTHING.
Look at this.
That's a big fish.
I could almost reach down
and grab its mouth.
Do you have a calamari?
There's a catfish here.
It's big.
It's 140 pounds, plus.
It is two feet beneath me.
The bank goes down here.
I am looking into its mouth.
I could almost reach down
and touch it.
Well, the fish has backed off.
I think he could see me.
I'm gonna throw this
really hard.
NO REACTION. NO REACTION.
THE FISH IS JUST
MELTING AWAY BACKWARDS.
THIS IS A REALLY RARE SIGHT.
THAT FISH IS 7 FOOT LONG,
IT'S ABOUT 140 POUNDS, AT LEAST,
AND IT WAS IN THE MARGINS,
AND I COULD SEE THE WHOLE FISH.
THERE IT IS.
THAT'S A SIGHT.
THAT IS A RARE SIGHT.
THAT IS A BIG FISH.
IF I GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES, THEN, I
COULD HAVE PATTED HIM ON THE HEAD.
MOUTH LIKE THAT,
RIGHT UNDERNEATH ME.
AND LOOKING DOWN ON ITS BACK, THIS
WONDERFUL, LIGHT CAMO PATTERN,
THIS DISRUPTIVE
SORT OF BLACK AND WHITE.
THREW A STONE TO SEE
IF THERE WOULD BE A REACTION.
NO.
HE JUST REVERSED BACK, AND
THEN UNDER THE BOAT AND AWAY.
I REALLY LIKE SEEING FISH
LIKE THAT.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
REALLY GOOD.
ANY OTHER FISH WOULD HAVE BEEN
SPOOKED OFF BY THAT STONE.
IT WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED
IN A FLASH.
AND THAT GUY IS NOT EVEN
A REALLY BIG ONE.
I'M ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER EBRO IN
SPAIN HUNTING DOWN GIANT WELS CATFISH.
THEY'RE ESTIMATED TO PUT ON
UP TO 10 POUNDS A YEAR.
IF THAT'S TRUE, IT WON'T BE
LONG BEFORE AN EBRO WELS
REACHES THE MAN-EATING PROPORTIONS
OF MEDIEVAL FOLKLORE.
IF I'M AFTER A MAN-EATER, I NEED TO CATCH,
AT THE VERY LEAST, A MAN-SIZED FISH...
ONE THAT FALLS ON THE FAT SIDE
OF 150 POUNDS.
IT'S TIME TO RIG UP.
RATHER THAN CASTING, WE DROP
OUR BAITS OVER 100 YARDS OUT,
JUST SHORT OF THE SUNKEN TREES
ALONG THE FLOODED RIVER CHANNEL.
TAKE UP THE SLACK.
THEN, WITH THE HIGH-TECH ALARMS
SET, I CAN ENJOY THE SPANISH SUN.
AND NOW WE WAIT.
THIS IS NOT
MY PREFERRED FISHING TECHNIQUE.
I LIKE TO FEEL THE LINE
BE IN CONTACT WITH THE BAIT,
BUT WELS ARE NOT DELICATE FEEDERS,
AND, BESIDES, IT'S HOT HERE...
YES. HERE, HERE!
AND IT'S ABOUT
TO GET HOTTER.
THAT'S TAKING LINE,
THAT'S TAKING LINE.
THAT'S TAKING LINE.
THIS IS MY FIRST SUPERSIZED SPANISH WELS,
AND, IMMEDIATELY, IT FEELS SERIOUSLY BIG.
THIS IS PHYSICAL,
PHYSICAL STUFF.
A SERIOUS BURST FROM THAT FISH
WHEN IT FIRST TOOK.
IT'S ALREADY TAKING LINE ON US.
STICK IT OUT.
MY FOREARM
IS ALMOST CRAMPING UP.
IT'S A GOOD SIZE.
HAVE YOU GOT THE FISH?
I DID GET IT.
FEELS LIKE... YEAH. HE
WAS MOVING UP THE SIDE.
THESE SPANISH WELS ARE HUNTING
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.
THEY REALLY ARE BREAKING
THEIR PROGRAMMING.
AND THESE FISH EVEN SEEM
USED TO BEING HANDLED.
MY FIRST FISH IS 140 POUNDS AND
MEASURES 6 FOOT, 9 INCHES.
IF THESE FISH ARE PUTTING ON
10 POUNDS A YEAR,
THEN, IN 20 YEARS, THIS ALREADY MASSIVE
CREATURE COULD WEIGH AS MUCH AS 340 POUNDS,
MORE THAN DOUBLE
ITS PRESENT SIZE.
AND IF THEY DO LIVE UNTIL 80
YEARS, I'LL LET YOU DO THE MATHS.
THE ONLY THING THAT WILL RESTRICT THEM IS
FOOD, BUT THERE IS ONE FOOD SUPPLY HERE
THAT IS IN HUGE QUANTITIES...
OTHER CATFISH.
THE WELS IS NOT JUST
A MAN-EATER.
IT'S A CANNIBAL.
JUST GETTING SORT OF A COOL
SCIENTIFIC LOOK AT THIS ANIMAL.
I MEAN, THE FIRST THING,
OBVIOUSLY THE THING TO DO,
START AT THE BUSINESS END...
THE HEAD.
I MEAN, THE MAIN THING IS JUST
THIS VERY, VERY WIDE MOUTH
ABOUT 10 INCHES ACROSS ON THIS ANIMAL,
AND YOU'VE GOT NEEDLELIKE TEETH.
THEY ARE SHARP, AS WELL.
YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN THERE,
AND THEY'LL DRAW BLOOD.
BUT IN TERMS OF GETTING A GRIP,
JUST PERFECT.
IF THEY CLAMP DOWN TIGHT
WITH THOSE SORT OF JAW MUSCLES,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET OUT OF THAT.
THEY'RE JUST PURPOSE-BUILT
FOR LURKING ON THE BOTTOM
AND GRABBING STUFF
THAT COMES ABOVE THEM,
AND THEY'RE GONNA KNOW
THAT STUFF IS THERE, THE PREY,
BECAUSE THEIR EYES
ARE ON TOP OF THEIR HEAD,
BUT MORE TO THE POINT, THEY'VE GOT
THESE, AND THESE ARE JUST, YOU KNOW...
THIS IS LIKE SORT OF
EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION.
YOU CAN TELL
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WATER.
THESE WILL PICK UP VIBRATIONS AND ALSO
CHEMICALS IN VERY, VERY SENSITIVE,
VERY SMALL QUANTITIES,
IN BOTH CASES.
ON THE SIDE, YOU'VE GOT... VERY PRONOUNCED
ON THIS ANIMAL... THE LATERAL LINE,
AND THIS IS THEIR SUPER
ORGAN, THE SUPER-TOUCH ORGAN.
IT JUST PICKS UP VIBRATIONS
IN THE WATER, YOU KNOW,
OFTEN, AGAIN,
AT A VERY LOW LEVEL.
AND, ALSO, YOU CAN SEE HERE
THESE SORT OF MARKS ON THE SKIN.
NOW, I THINK THESE ARE PROBABLY
WOUNDS FROM ANOTHER FISH,
POSSIBLY WHEN THIS FISH
WAS SPAWNING,
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT
A LITTLE BIT TOO ROUGH,
A LITTLE BIT
SORT OF OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC.
STOMACH HERE.
THERE'S THE VENT THERE.
SO, ACTUALLY,
IF IT SWALLOWS SOMETHING...
THIS FISH COULD POTENTIALLY
SWALLOW SOMETHING THAT LONG.
IT GOES TO THE BACK
OF THE THROAT, WHICH IS HERE.
IT OPENS UP THIS SORT OF
SPHINCTER MUSCLE THERE,
AND IT COULD SWALLOW SOMETHING
ABOUT TWO FOOT LONG.
SO, NO PROBLEM ACCOMMODATING THOSE MEDIEVAL
ACCOUNTS OF BABIES AND SMALL CHILDREN
IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST.
IT LOOKS LIKE WELS CATFISH
CAN SWALLOW PREY
ROUGHLY A THIRD
OF THEIR OWN BODY LENGTH,
SO IF THESE FISH IN THE EBRO
KEEP ON GROWING,
IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT THEY COULD REACH A SIZE
WHERE THEY WILL HAVE
MAN-EATING POTENTIAL.
FACT IS FOLLOWING CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF
WHAT WAS ONCE THOUGHT TO BE FICTION.
LOOKING AT THIS FISH,
IT IS THE PERFECT PREDATOR.
I MEAN, THEY DO EAT ANYTHING...
LITERALLY ANYTHING...
BUT THEY ARE PERFECTLY EQUIPPED TO PREDATE
AND ALSO TO COME FROM UNDERNEATH.
YOU KNOW, THAT IS JUST... A MOUTH ON THE
END OF A SOLID, SINUOUS PIECE OF MUSCLE.
ANYWAY, I CAN'T HOLD HIM
MUCH LONGER.
WELS, LIKE ALL CATFISH, COULD LIVE
QUITE A LONG TIME OUT OF WATER
IF KEPT COOL AND WET.
THIS GUY SEEMS QUITE RELUCTANT
TO LEAVE.
SHALL I LEAVE HIM THERE?
A NICE RUB ON HIS BELLY.
IN A SPLIT SECOND,
THE FISH TURNS.
I'M JUST QUICK ENOUGH
TO ESCAPE.
THAT WAS THE FIRST CATFISH
ATTACK ON A HUMAN ON-CAMERA.
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
""IS HE GONNA MOVE?""
AND HE DID
SORT OF DOUBLE 'ROUND.
AND I HAVE HEARD STORIES OF THEM
ACTUALLY HAVING A BITE
OF SOMEBODY WHO'S CAUGHT THEM.
SO, I THOUGHT,
""THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.""
THERE'S NO MARK THERE,
THERE'S NO MARK THERE.
BUT IT HAS HAPPENED.
I FISH ON INTO DARKNESS, AND
I GET ANOTHER SURPRISE.
IT'S JUST PULLED ME ON MY ASS.
FISH ON.
ME PULLED TOWARDS THE WATER.
I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA GO IN THERE.
THERE'S NOTHING...
THAT'S A SIZEABLE FISH,
SIZEABLE FISH.
WITH SO MANY FISHERMEN AROUND, THE
ONLY INCONVENIENCE THESE FISH SUFFER
FOR THEIR MIDNIGHT FEASTS IS
A LITTLE BIT OF MANHANDLING.
IMAGINE BEING IN A RIVER
AT NIGHT
WITH ONE OF THESE THINGS
SWIMMING AROUND YOUR LEGS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG IT IS YET.
I CAN SEE IT'S BIG.
RIGHT?
YEP.
148, I THINK.
147. 147.
HOW WIDE?
IT'S ABOUT NINE INCHES,
ISN'T IT?
MM-HMM.
THIS FISH IS ALMOST AS HEAVY
AS I AM.
I MEAN, IT IS... THIS IS
QUITE A MONSTROUS BEAST.
AND THE POWER, AS WELL...
I FELT THE POWER.
THE THING NEARLY PULLED ME
IN THE RIVER.
SO, YOU KNOW, DEFINITELY A FIERCE PREDATORY
ANIMAL, AND SOME OF THESE STORIES
ABOUT THEM MAYBE ATTACKING
SWIMMERS... I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN BELIEVE THEM NOW
HAVING ACTUALLY SEEN
THE SIZE OF ONE OF THESE THINGS
ACTUALLY UP CLOSE.
I'M STILL SHORT OF MY TARGET
150-POUND BEAST.
THESE CREATURES REALLY ARE UGLY
OUT OF THE WATER.
I WANT TO SEE THEM IN THEIR NATURAL ELEMENT,
BUT THAT MEANS GETTING INTO THE WATER.
CAMERAMAN SIMON AND I
ARE GOING TO TRY AN EXPERIMENT.
I WANT TO SEE AND FILM
A WELS CATFISH UNDERWATER.
I WANT TO SEE EXACTLY HOW EUROPE'S
BIGGEST FRESHWATER PREDATOR OPERATES
IN ITS ELEMENT.
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SEE IS THE MOMENT
WHEN THE WELS GETS TO STRIKE ITS PREY.
IT ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT VERY, VERY FEW PEOPLE
GET TO SEE, BUT I DO HAVE A FEW IDEAS
ABOUT WHAT I CAN USE
TO TEMPT THE FISH IN.
THIS IS THE CAMERA, AND THIS IS
WHAT'S GONNA BE BEHIND THE BOAT,
AND ABOUT THREE FEET BEHIND THIS
IS GONNA BE THE LURE,
SO IT'S GONNA BE LOOKING BACK.
THING IS, THIS IS ACTUALLY
QUITE A LUMP OF A CAMERA,
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A SMALL CAMERA,
SO I THINK... HERE WE GO.
FLOATATION.
TWO, IF WE NEED THEM.
TWO TANKS.
AND TO STOP IT WIBBLE-WOBBLING
AROUND A LITTLE BIT
BECAUSE WE'RE ANGLING,
THERE WE GO, ONE OF THOSE,
AND THAT WILL JUST KEEP
IT FLYING STRAIGHT AND LEVEL.
AND WE'LL LOB THAT OFF THE BACK OF
THE BOAT, AND WE'LL SEE THE LURE,
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE SOMETHING
COME UP AND GRAB THE BAIT.
I'LL NEED TO HANG ON.
OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW,
IF SOMETHING BIG TAKES THIS,
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE MONITOR
COULD GO OVERBOARD.
THIS IS ACTUALLY
WORKING REALLY WELL.
I'VE GOT THE LURE IN PICTURE.
IT'S BANG IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE SCREEN.
I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING.
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY IT'S JUST THERE,
AND YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING.
I CAN ACTUALLY SEE MY LURE
OUT BEHIND THE BOAT.
A FISH.
I THINK IT WAS A CARP.
YEAH. OH.
WE'RE BUMPING OVER THE BOTTOM.
OH, DEAR. WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? RIGHT,
NEED TO... IN A BIT, IN A BIT, IN A BIT.
IT'S BUMPING. IT'S BUMPING.
I'VE LOST THE LURE, HAVEN'T I?
I'VE LOST THE LURE.
I THINK THE CAMERA MIGHT HAVE
BEEN BASHED AROUND A BIT, THOUGH.
AAH!
NOT ROBUST ENOUGH, UNFORTUNATELY, TO
WITHSTAND BEING BASHED ALONG THE BOTTOM.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
ACTUALLY DOING VERY WELL.
BEFORE THAT,
THERE WAS THIS GRAY SHADOW
THAT APPEARED FROM NOWHERE
WHICH SORT OF CAME AND WENT,
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A CATFISH INVESTIGATING IT
AND SHYING OFF
AT THE LAST MINUTE.
OR IT COULD HAVE JUST BEEN
A ROCK GOING PAST. I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SEE IS ANOTHER UNEXPECTED
ASPECT OF THESE FISHES' BEHAVIOR.
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE DOING
SOMETHING CALLED CLONKING, AND IT'S...
SENDING A SOUND WAVE
DOWN INTO THE WATER.
AND WE CAN SEE ON THE SONAR...
- OH, YEAH. - YEAH, YEAH?
THIS IS A FISH.
OH, YES, YES, YES.
CATFISH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
ON YOUR LURES.
OH, THERE IT IS!
THERE IT IS! I'VE GOT IT!
THERE'S A CATFISH!
THERE'S A CATFISH!
SEE HIM?
YEAH!
IT'S RIGHT UNDER THE LURE!
YEAH.
FANTASTIC!
I SEE HIM ON THE SONAR.
YEAH, YEAH.
THERE HE IS. THERE HE IS.
TENTACLES.
THAT'S BIG?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
RIGHT.
WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW...
AND IT'S COMING UP NOW, RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN.
FANTASTIC.
LOOK AT THAT.
HE'S ATTACKING THE CAMERA.
WHAT THIS HAS JUST DEMONSTRATED IS
THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT SPLASHING,
WHEN YOU'VE GOT COMMOTION
ON THE SURFACE,
THE CATFISH... WHICH, THEY LIVE ON THE
BOTTOM... THEY WILL COME UP TO INVESTIGATE.
AH, YES,
YES, YES, YES, YES.
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!
THERE IT IS!
LOOK AT THAT!
THERE IT IS!
OH, HE'S COME OFF.
COME OFF.
THIS IS AMAZING... GETTING A
FISH ON-CAMERA TAKING A BAIT,
ATTRACTED IN
BY SOUND AND VIBRATION.
LIKE SHARKS TO A PLANE CRASH,
THESE FISH FEAR NOTHING.
IT EVEN ATTACKS THE CAMERA.
IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD, THOUGH, JUST TO
ACTUALLY SEE WHAT I'VE SEEN ON THE SCREEN.
VERY, VERY RARE
TO SEE THIS FISH BEHAVIOR.
SO I FEEL SORT OF QUITE
PRIVILEGED TO HAVE SEEN THAT.
ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T GET A FISH
INTO THE BOAT,
I ACTUALLY FEEL
IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL DAY
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT I'VE ACTUALLY
LEARNT A LOT ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR,
PARTICULARLY HOW THEY REACT TO
VIBRATION, TO COMMOTION ON THE SURFACE.
HERE'S THIS FISH THAT LIVES ON THE BOTTOM,
BUT IF IT HEARS SOMETHING, IT COMES UP,
AND THE TENTACLES ARE WAVING,
AND IT INVESTIGATES.
WITHOUT THE CAMERA UNDER THE WATER, YOU
JUST ASSUME THAT NOTHING IS HAPPENING.
AS SOON AS YOU PUT THE CAMERA
THERE, DANGLING UNDER THE BOAT,
YOU'RE MAKING THE NOISE
WITH THE CLONK,
THEY'RE COMING UP
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WATER,
AND THEY WON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN SO FAR...
THE REACTION OF THE WELS CATFISH
TO A BAIT IN THE WATER... CONFIRMS
ITS AGGRESSION AS A TOP PREDATOR
AND ALSO ITS FEARLESSNESS.
COMBINE THAT WITH SUPERSIZING, AND YOU'VE
GOT A CREATURE THAT YOU REALLY WOULDN'T
WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO
IN THE WATER.
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW NOW IS JUST
HOW BIG A WELS WOULD NEED TO BE
TO TACKLE ME IN THE WATER.
I'VE SAID
THEY LOOK LIKE GIANT SLUGS,
BUT IN THEIR ELEMENT, THEY'RE
LIKE SUPER-SENSITIVE SHARKS.
TIME FOR ANOTHER EXPERIMENT.
LIKE MOST PEOPLE, IF I JUMP
IN THE WATER, I DON'T SINK.
I FLOAT,
EVEN AFTER A HEAVY LUNCH.
AND IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT.
I'M FLAPPING MY ARMS
A LITTLE BIT AND MY LEGS.
BUT THE QUESTION IS, HOW BIG WOULD A
FISH NEED TO BE TO PULL ME UNDER?
RIGHT.
I'VE GOT ONE DIVE WEIGHT ON
AT THE MOMENT... 4 1/2 POUNDS...
AND I CAN SUPPORT IT, ACTUALLY.
THAT'S HARDER.
IT'S HARDER.
9 POUNDS NOW.
DOUBLING THE RATE OF PADDLING,
BUT I CAN STILL JUST ABOUT
KEEP MYSELF ON THE SURFACE.
RIGHT.
I CAN SUPPORT 9 POUNDS WITH A BIT OF
FLAPPING AND FLAILING OF MY LEGS.
WE'VE JUST WEIGHED THIS ROCK.
THIS IS GONNA MAKE IT
UP TO 20 POUNDS.
I'LL JUST SEE HOW I DO AGAINST
THAT COMBINED WEIGHT IN THE WATER.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
VERY INTERESTING.
20 POUNDS OF WEIGHT ATTACHED TO ME, I COULD
JUST ABOUT KEEP MY HEAD ABOVE-WATER.
IT WAS A STRUGGLE.
I RECKON ANOTHER 5 POUNDS,
AND I'D HAVE JUST GONE,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
MY ARMS AND LEGS
WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAILING AROUND,
AND THAT'S INTERESTING,
'CAUSE IF YOU ASK MOST PEOPLE
HOW BIG A FISH WOULD HAVE TO BE TO PULL
A BODY UNDERWATER, THEY'D SAY PROBABLY
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
AS THAT PERSON.
NOW, I WEIGH ABOUT 175 POUNDS, AND
ON LAND, I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,
BUT IN THE WATER, YOU KNOW, A FISH WOULD
JUST HAVE TO EXERT A PULL OF 25 POUNDS,
ABOUT 1/7 OF MY BODY WEIGHT.
AND I WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.
I'D JUST BE GONE.
AND IF I TOOK A LUNGFUL OF WATER
UNDERNEATH THERE,
THEN NOBODY WOULD EVER
SEE ME AGAIN.
OKAY,
THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW
THAT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE
A HUGE FISH TO PULL ME UNDER.
LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK
AT PULLING POWER.
THAT 147 POUNDER PULLED ME OFF MY
FEET AND ALMOST INTO THE WATER.
HOW MUCH FORCE CAN I GENERATE?
I COULDN'T EVEN PULL IN OUR
DIRECTOR, AND SHE'S HALF MY WEIGHT.
SHE'S A MATCH FOR ME
EVEN ONE-HANDED.
SO, I COULD BE PULLED
UNDER THE WATER
BY A FISH JUST HALF MY SIZE...
75 TO 100 POUNDS.
AND THE THING ABOUT THE EBRO IS
THAT THE RIVER IS JUST FULL OF FISH
THAT SIZE AND MUCH BIGGER,
WHICH POSSIBLY EXPLAINS
WHY YOU DON'T SEE
VERY MANY PEOPLE SWIMMING.
WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT
IN NORTHERN SPAIN,
I'M TRYING TO BREAK THE 150-POUND
MARKER THAT I HAVE SET MYSELF.
MY RESPECT FOR THESE FISH OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS HAS REALLY GROWN.
OH! OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!
AAH!
AAH!
IF THIS ONE PULLS ME OVER,
I'M IN REAL TROUBLE.
I'M NEARLY TIPPING FORWARD OVER THAT
EDGE, AND I'M JUST GONNA MOVE A BIT.
MY GROIN IS STARTING TO ACHE.
THERE IT IS.
THE ROD'S JAMMED IN.
IT'S JUST PHYSICAL STUFF...
PHYSICAL WORK.
IT'S COMING UP.
STRONG FISH, BUT I THINK...
YEAH... IT'S TIRING.
TIRING, TIRING.
THERE IT IS!
THERE'S THE FISH!
HEY!
GOOD GRIEF!
MY CROTCH IS KILLING ME!
AND THERE IT IS.
BUT DOES IT WEIGH
MORE THAN 150 POUNDS?
GET A MEASURE OF THE BEAST.
THAT IS 7 FOOT... 1, 2, 3, 4...
7 FOOT, 4 INCHES.
LET ME OPEN THE MOUTH.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE ECHO
COMING OUT OF THE MOUTH THERE.
HELLO, HELLO!
I CAN SEE ITS GULLET
OPENING AND CLOSING.
IF I WAS SO INCLINED, I COULD PUT
MY FIST DOWN THERE QUITE EASILY.
THAT IS AN EATING MACHINE.
THE WHOLE THING IS NEARLY 8 FOOT
OF JUST SOLID, RIPPLING MUSCLE.
IF THAT GRABBED HOLD OF YOUR LEG,
THAT'S AN UNPLEASANT-ENOUGH THOUGHT.
BUT IF THAT DECIDED NOT TO LET GO, AND
YOU WERE SWIMMING, YOU'D BE HISTORY.
I'M ABOUT 175 POUNDS ON A GOOD DAY OR A
BAD DAY, DEPENDING HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
THIS FISH COULD BE
MORE THAN THAT.
YEAH.
74 KILOS.
THAT'S ABOUT 163 POUNDS.
NOT QUITE AS BIG AND FAT
AND UGLY AS I AM.
WHAT I FIND REALLY HARD TO CREDIT...
WHEN I WAS DOING THOSE EXPERIMENTS
WHERE I WAS TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH
FORCE I COULD EXERT IN THE WATER,
AND THERE WAS SOMEBODY ON
THE BANK WITH A SPRING BALANCE
JUST HOOKED 'ROUND THEIR FINGER
READING OFF, ""OKAY, 30 OR 40 POUNDS.""
THIS THING IN THE WATER IS
ALMOST PULLING ME OFF THE BANK.
I WAS HAVING TO DIG IN AND REALLY
ACT LIKE I WAS IN A TUG-OF-WAR.
HOW SOMETHING WITH NOTHING SOLID
TO ACTUALLY GRAB HOLD OF
CAN EXERT THAT FORCE IN THE WATER, YOU
KNOW, I FIND QUITE MIND-BOGGLING.
IT IS VERY, VERY
IMPRESSIVE, INDEED.
AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO LET THIS GUY GO.
LET'S SEE HOW HE REACTS.
FISH HAS RECOVERED A BIT...
MAYBE A BIT MORE THAN I HAVE.
I'M GONNA PUT IT
BACK IN THE WATER.
IF IT DOES HAVE A GO AT ME, I'M
GONNA ACTUALLY STAND MY GROUND
AND... A BIT LIKE AN ELEPHANT...
SEE IF IT IT'S A FALSE CHARGE,
OR WILL IT ACTUALLY GO
AND GRAB MY LEG?
THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER...
THAT THIS FISH IS BIGGER THAN I AM.
IT'S GOT A FEW INCHES ON ME.
I'VE GOT A FEW POUNDS ON THIS
FISH, BUT I'M IN THE WATER.
MY EXTRA WEIGHT
ACTUALLY COUNTS FOR NOTHING.
IT'S THE FISH'S ENVIRONMENT.
SINKING DOWN TOWARDS MY FOOT.
I THINK... I THINK MY REFLEXES
OVERRULED WHAT I WANTED TO DO,
WHICH WAS STAND MY GROUND, BUT
I CAN VISUALIZE IT TOO MUCH,
WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON DOWN THERE,
WHAT MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH ITS MIND,
SO DON'T TANGLE WITH THESE GUYS IN
THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS THE MESSAGE.
WELS CATFISH ARE PREDATORS
WITH A LOT OF ATTITUDE.
TWO OF THE FISH THAT I CAUGHT TURNED
ON ME WHILE I WAS RELEASING THEM.
BUT AS FAR AS EATING PEOPLE...
A WELS WILL SWALLOW ANYTHING
THAT FITS INSIDE
ITS MONSTROUS GUT.
AH! YES, YES, YES!
AND IF THAT INCLUDES YOU, WELL,
IT'S NO RESPECTER OF SPECIES.
IT SEEMS
THAT IF THEY EVER WENT AWAY,
THESE MEDIEVAL MONSTERS
ARE NOW BACK, ALIVE AND WELL,
AND STILL GROWING IN THE RIVER
EBRO IN NORTHERN SPAIN.
THIS IS QUITE
A MONSTROUS BEAST.
IF I CAME BACK HERE IN 20 OR 30
YEARS, I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THERE COULD BE SOMETHING IN HERE
THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING
THAT'S EVER EXISTED BEFORE.
AND IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE,
A BABY-SNATCHING, MAN-EATING WELS
COULD ONCE AGAIN
MAKE THE FRONT-PAGE NEWS.","The alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is a euryhaline ray-finned fish in the clade Ginglymodi of the infraclass Holostei , being most closely related to the bowfins. It is the largest species in the gar family (Lepisosteidae), and is among the largest freshwater fishes in North America. The fossil record traces its group's existence back to the Early Cretaceous over 100 million years ago. Gars are often referred to as ""primitive fishes"" or ""living fossils"", because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine, which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe in both air and water. Their common name was derived from their resemblance to the American alligator, particularly their broad snouts and long, sharp teeth. It is suggested that an alligator gar can grow up to 10 ft (3.0 m) in length.
The body of an alligator gar is torpedo-shaped, usually brown or olive colored, fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. In very rare occurrences, they can also be black, seen in gars that have a high level of melanin. Their scales are not like the scales of other fishes; rather, they are ganoid scales, which are bone-like, rhomboidal-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance. Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable, and are excellent protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a dual row of large, sharp teeth that are used to impale and hold prey. Alligator gar are stalking, ambush predators, primarily piscivores, but they also ambush and eat waterfowl and small mammals they find floating on the water's surface.
Populations of alligator gar have been extirpated from much of their historic range as a result of habitat destruction, indiscriminate culling, and unrestricted harvests. Populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the United States extending into Mexico. They are considered euryhaline because they can adapt to varying salinities, ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes, estuaries, and bays along the Gulf of Mexico.
For nearly a half century, alligator gar were considered ""trash fish"", or a ""nuisance species"" detrimental to sport fisheries, and were targeted for elimination by state and federal authorities in the United States. The 1980s brought a better understanding of the ecological balance necessary to sustain an ecosystem, and an awareness that the alligator gar is an important element of the ecosystems they inhabit was eventually understood. Over time, alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies. They are also protected under the Lacey Act, which makes transporting certain species of fish in interstate commerce illegal when in violation of state law or regulation. Several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild, and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public. Alligator gar are being cultured in ponds, pools, raceways, and tanks by federal hatcheries for mitigation stocking, by universities for research purposes, and in Mexico for consumption.


== Anatomy ==

Alligator gar are the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fishes found in North America.  Mature alligator gar commonly measure 6 ft (1.8 m) in length, and weigh over 100 lb (45 kg). However, anecdotal reports suggest they can grow up to 10 ft (3 m) in length, and weigh as much as 350 lb (159 kg). The largest alligator gar officially recorded was inadvertently caught in the net of fisherman Kenny Williams of Vicksburg, Mississippi, while he was fishing the oxbow lakes of the Mississippi River on February 14, 2011. Williams was pulling up his net on Lake Chotard, expecting to find buffalo fish, but instead discovered a large alligator gar tangled in his net. The gar was 8 ft 5+1⁄4 in (2.572 m) long, weighed 327 lb (148 kg), and its girth was 47 in (120 cm). According to wildlife officials, the fish was estimated to be between 50 and 70 years old; one report estimated the gar's age to be at least 95. Williams donated it to the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson, where it will remain on display.
All gars have torpedo-shaped bodies, but some distinguishing characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size; heavy bodies; broad heads; short, broad snouts; large, sharp teeth; and a double row of teeth on their upper jaws. They are usually brown or olive colored, fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. The dorsal and anal fins are positioned toward the back of their bodies, and their caudal fins are abbreviate heterocercal, or nonsymmetrical.


== Physiology ==

Alligator gar have gills, but unlike other species of fish, with few exceptions, they also have a highly vascularized swim bladder lung that supplements gill respiration. The bladder not only provides buoyancy, but also enables them to breathe in air. This capability allows alligator gar to inhabit stagnant and/or insufficiently aerated bodies of water that are poorly oxygenated or hypoxic, in which most other fishes would die of suffocation due to a lack of dissolved oxygen within the water. The swim bladder is connected to their fore gut by a small pneumatic duct, which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the water's surface, an action seen quite frequently on lakes in the Southern United States during the hot summer.
The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes, which have flexible elasmoid scales; gar bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are rhomboidal-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin, which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.


== Taxonomy and evolution ==
Lacépède first described the alligator gar in 1803. The original name was Lepisosteus spatula, but was later changed by E.O. Wiley in 1976 to Atractosteus spatula to recognize two distinct taxa of gars. Synonyms of Atractosteus spatula include: Lesisosteus [sic] ferox (Rafinesque 1820), and Lepisosteus spatula (Lacepede 1803). Fossils from the order Lepisosteiformes have been collected in Europe from the Cretaceous to Oligocene periods; in Africa and India from the Cretaceous; and in North America from the Cretaceous to recent times. The Lepisosteidae are the only extant family of gars with seven species, all located in North and Central America. The fossil record traces the existence of gars such as the Alligator gar back over 100 million years ago to the Early Cretaceous period. Despite being a highly evolved species, alligator gar are often referred to as ""primitive fishes"" or ""living fossils"", because they have retained a few morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors, with seemingly few to no apparent changes, such as: a spiral valve intestine, which is also common to the digestive system of sharks; an abbreviate heterocercal tail; and a swim bladder lung for breathing in both air and water.


== Feeding behavior ==

Alligator gar are relatively passive, seemingly sluggish solitary fish, but voracious ambush predators. They are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores, but gar will also ambush and eat water fowl, other birds, turtles, and small mammals that may be floating on the surface. Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface, and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach. The gar will then lunge forward, and with a sweeping motion, grab their prey, impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth.
Diet studies have shown alligator gar to be opportunistic piscivores, and even scavengers depending on the availability of their preferred food source. They occasionally ingest sport fish, but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on forage fishes, such as gizzard shad, as well as invertebrates and water fowl. However, brackish water populations of alligator gar are known to feed heavily on blue crabs, in addition to fish such as the hardhead catfish (Ariopsis felis). Diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat-engine parts in their stomachs.


== Spawning ==
As with most ancestral species, alligator gar are long-lived, and sexually late maturing. Most females do not reach sexual maturity until after their first decade of life, while males reach sexual maturity in half that time. The conditions must be precise for a successful spawning to occur. Preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended photoperiod and rising water temperatures, but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event. When rivers rise and spread over the floodplain, they create oxbow lakes and sloughs, and inundate terrestrial vegetation, which in turn provides protection and a nutrient-rich habitat for larval fish and fry. Once the water temperature has reached 68 to 82 °F (20 to 28 °C), and all the other criteria are met, gar move into the grassy, weed-laden shallows to spawn.
Actual spawning occurs when males gather around gravid females, and begin writhing, twisting, bumping into, and slithering over the tops of females, an activity which triggers the release of eggs. Males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column. The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation, and development begins. Only a few days are needed for the eggs to hatch into larval fish, and another 10 days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation, and start moving about as young fry. Egg production is variable, and believed to be dependent on the size of the female. A common formula used for predicting the number of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs/gram of body weight, which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn. The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested.


== Distribution ==


=== Natural range ===
Alligator gar inhabit a wide variety of aquatic habitats, but most are found in the Southern United States in reservoirs and lakes, in the backwaters of lowland rivers, and in the brackish waters of estuaries, bayous, and bays. Gars occur southward along the Gulf Coast of Texas, into Tamaulipas and northern Veracruz, Mexico; however, records from Nicaragua and Costa Rica are considered ""suspect and refuted"". They have occasionally been seen in the Gulf of Mexico. In Texas and Louisiana, large gars are commonly seen breaking the surface in reservoirs, bayous, and brackish marshes. They are found throughout the lower Mississippi River Valley and Gulf Coast states of the Southern United States and Mexico as far south as Veracruz, and encompassing the following states in the US: Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, and Florida. Reports suggest alligator gar were once numerous throughout much of their northern range, but valid sightings today are rare, and may occur once every few years. Records of historical distribution indicate alligator gar once inhabited regions as far north as central Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, and west-central Illinois, where they are now listed as extirpated. The most northerly verified catch was in Meredosia, Illinois, in 1922. In 2016, there were efforts to reintroduce alligator gar between Tennessee and Illinois, as part of an effort to control invasive Asian carp.


=== Outside natural range ===
Alligator gar is an invasive species in Mainland China, where it can be purchased as an exotic pet fish. Due to its large size and armored scales, it has few natural predators even within its natural range, and its poisonous eggs may pose a passive threat to other fish. The fish has been sighted in eight provinces, and authorities have worked to remove it.
In November 2008, a broadhead gar, genus Atractosteus, measuring 5.2 to 6.4 ft (1.6 to 2.0 m) was caught in the Caspian Sea north of Esenguly, Turkmenistan, by two officials of Turkmenistan Fishery Protection.
On September 4, 2009, a 3 ft 3 in (0.99 m) alligator gar was found in Tak Wah Park in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong. Over the next two days, at least 16 other alligator gar, the largest measuring 4.9 ft (1.5 m), were found in ponds within public parks in Hong Kong. Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists, and had lived there for several years.  However, after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles, the use of terms like ""horrible man-eating fish"" had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers.  Officials with Leisure and Cultural Services in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large, carnivorous fish might harm children.  Not unusually, the large, sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar can precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species. Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans, though none of the reports have been confirmed.
On January 21, 2011, an alligator gar measuring 4 ft 11 in (1.50 m) was caught in a canal in Pasir Ris, Singapore, by two recreational fishermen. The fish was taken to a nearby pond, where the owner confirmed it was an alligator gar rather than an arapaima, as the men had initially thought.
Anecdotal reports have been made of alligator gar captured in various parts of India, but are believed to be the result of incidental releases by aquarium hobbyists and the like.  In August 2015, an alligator gar was found entangled in cloth inside a well in Dadar, where it had been living for quite some time. It was rescued by animal activists and returned to the well unharmed.  In June 2016, a 3.5-ft alligator gar was  caught from Subhash Sarovar Lake in Kolkata. Other incidents over the years have been random, ranging from captures in coastal waters during environmental assessments to captures in private ponds.
On June 27, 2020, an alligator gar measuring 112 cm (3 ft 8in) was reported dead on the shore of Gonyeli Baraji reservoir, North Cyprus. Specialists from Cyprus Wildlife Research Institute collected the fish, and explained its species to be alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula). It is suspected that the fish had been released recently, and could not cope with the environment and died; however, it could be that the fish was resident there for years. A necropsy will be applied to find out more.
Similarly, on May 12, 2023, an alligator gar measuring less than 2 feet was caught during a deweeding process in Dal Lake of Kashmir near the Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC), sparking concerns about potential effects on the ecosystem.
In Thailand, an alligator gar have long been considered an imported aquarium fish. In reports of their discovery in various natural water sources, believed that they were released by aquaristen. In 2024, they were reported in the Mekong River in Chiang Rai Province, a natural border between Thailand, Laos and Myanmar, alongside Siberian sturgeon.


== Human uses ==


=== Early history ===
Native Americans in the South and Caribbean peoples used the alligator gar's ganoid scales for arrow heads, breastplates, and as shielding to cover plows. Early settlers tanned the skins to make a strong, durable leather to cover their wooden plows, make purses, and craft various other items. Gar oil was also used by the people of Arkansas as a repellent for buffalo gnats.
For nearly half a century, alligator gar were considered ""trash fish"", or ""nuisance species"" by state and federal authorities who targeted them for elimination to protect gamefish populations, and to prevent alleged attacks on humans, a claim that remains unsubstantiated with the exception of occasional injuries sustained from captured alligator gar thrashing around on the decks of boats. Fishermen participated in the slaughter of thousands of alligator gar believing they were providing a great service. In 1992, PBS affiliate KUHT channel 8 became the presenting station for a public-outreach program that documented the life history cycle of alligator gar titled The Alligator Gar: Predator or Prey?. It was the first documentary ever produced and televised nationally about alligator gar at a time when it was still being referred to as a trash fish. The half-hour program ran for three years as part of an educational series titled ""Exotic and Unusual Fishes"", produced by Earthwave Society. It first aired in primetime during the 1992 July sweeps, and drew a 2.8 rating/4 share, making it the number-one rated program of the evening for several PBS affiliates.  A decade passed before any significant action was taken to protect and preserve the remaining populations of alligator gar in the United States. Among the first to enact restoration and management practices was the Missouri Department of Conservation in partnership with Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.


=== Sport fish ===

The long-time public perception of alligator gar as trash fish or a nuisance species has changed, with increasing national and international attention on the species as a sport fish, which some have attributed to features on popular television shows. Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana allow regulated sport fishing of alligator gar. Texas has one of the best remaining fisheries for alligator gar, and in concert with its efforts to maintain a viable fishery, imposed a one-per-day bag limit on them in 2009. The Texas state record, and world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel, is 279 lb (127 kg), taken by Bill Valverde on January 1, 1951, on the Rio Grande in Texas. Alligator gar are also quite popular among bowfishers because of their large size, trophy potential, and fighting ability. The Texas state bowfishing record was set in 2001 by Marty McClellan with a 290 lb (130 kg) alligator gar from the Trinity River. The all-tackle record was a 302 lb (137 kg) alligator gar caught on a trotline in 1953 by T.C. Pierce Jr. In 1991, fishing guide Kirk Kirkland anecdotally reported catching an alligator gar measuring 9 ft 6 in (2.90 m) on rod and line from the Trinity River.


=== Commercialization and aquaculture ===

Declining populations of alligator gar throughout their historic range have resulted in the need to monitor wild populations and regulate commercial harvests.  Alligator gar have a high yield of white-meat fillets and a small percentage of waste relative to body weight. Fried gar balls, grilled filets, and fillets boiled in water with crab boil are popular dishes in the southern United States. There is also a small cottage industry that designs and sells jewelry made from the ganoid scales of alligator gar; some tan the hides to produce leather for making lamp shades, purses and a host of other novelty items. Historically, the price of wild gar meat sold commercially to wholesale distributors has fluctuated between $1.00/lb up to $2.50/lb. Retail prices in supermarkets and specialty stores have ranged from $3.00 to $3.50/lb.
Atractosteus gars, including alligator gar, tropical gars, and Cuban gars, are considered good candidates for aquaculture, particularly in developing regions, where their rapid growth, disease resistance, easy adaptation to artificial feeds as juveniles, and ability to tolerate low water quality are essential. Their ability to breathe in both air and water eliminates the need for costly aeration systems and other technology commonly used in aquaculture. Despite being considered ""trash"" or ""rough"" fish in most of North America, in regions of Central America and the southern United States they have become a popular food fish. Maintaining wild populations of gars has grown in importance to maintaining sustainable aquaculture for ""local food production, the aquarium trade, and conservation of biodiversity"".


=== Aquaria ===
Despite the large size alligator gar can attain, they are kept as aquarium fish, though many fish labeled as ""alligator gar"" in the aquarium trade are actually smaller species. Alligator gar require a very large aquarium or pond, and ample resources for them to thrive in captivity. They are also a popular fish for public aquaria and zoos. In many areas,  keeping alligator gar as pets is illegal, but they occasionally show up in fish stores.  Alligator gar are highly prized and sought after for private aquaria, particularly in Japan.  According to some reports, large alligator gar could fetch as much as US$40,000 in what some consider the ""Japanese black market"". In June 2011, three men from Florida and Louisiana were indicted on charges of illegally removing wild alligator gar from the Trinity River in Texas, and attempting to ship them to Japan for private collectors.  The indictments resulted from an undercover sting operation by special agents with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The charges included violations of three separate provisions of the Lacey Act, specifically conspiracy to submit a false label for fish transported in interstate commerce, conspiracy to transport fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation, and conspiracy to transport and sell fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation.  Two of the conspirators entered guilty pleas to one count, and the government dropped the other two charges against them.  A third conspirator went to trial on all three counts, was acquitted on one count, and found guilty on two.  The district court sentenced him to serve nine months in prison followed by one year of supervised release.  The case was appealed, and on April 15, 2014, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court.

European Maneater,Wels Catfish,Silurus glanis,"THE AMAZON RIVER IS HOME TO A TERRIFYING
COLLECTION OF MAN-EATING MONSTERS,
AND IN THE DARKEST CORNERS
LURKS A DINOSAUR.
LEGENDS TELL OF AN EVIL SPIRIT
INHABITING AN ENORMOUS FISH.
LONGER THAN A MAN,
IT IS ENCASED IN THICK SCALES,
AND IT CRUSHES ITS PREY
WITH A TONGUE MADE OF BONE.
BUT WITH A BODY OF PURE MUSCLE,
ITS PRIMARY WEAPON IS RAW POWER.
I'M JEREMY WADE,
BIOLOGIST AND EXTREME ANGLER,
AND I'VE ENCOUNTERED
THIS CREATURE ONCE BEFORE.
HEY!
THAT TIME, I CAME OUT SECOND BEST,
BUT NOW I'M READY FOR THE REMATCH.
YES!
I'VE BEEN COMING TO THE AMAZON FOR 15
YEARS, AND A TALE I'VE HEARD MANY TIMES
IS THAT OF A FISHERMAN
GOING MISSING.
FAR FROM HOME, ON A REMOTE TRIBUTARY
OF THE AMAZON, SOMETHING HAPPENS.
PEOPLE TELL OF A CREATURE
LEAPING OUT OF THE WATER,
KNOCKING THE FISHERMAN
FROM HIS CANOE.
BUT WITH NO EYEWITNESSES, THE LIST
OF SUSPECTS IS SPECULATIVE AT BEST.
COULD THERE REALLY BE A MONSTER IN
THE AMAZON CAPABLE OF DOING THIS?
AND IF SO, WHAT KIND
OF BEAST COULD IT BE?
ANACONDA... CAIMAN... PIRANHA
ARE ALL CONVICTED KILLERS.
BUT IN MY TRAVELS AROUND THE WORLD...
UGH! UGH!
I'VE CAUGHT SOME SUPERSIZED
FRESHWATER FISH
THAT ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE
OF DOING THE JOB.
IS THERE ONE MORE RIVER MONSTER TO ADD TO
THE LIST OF THE AMAZON'S USUAL SUSPECTS...
A CREATURE THAT HAS SOMEHOW
SLIPPED THROUGH THE NET?
THE STORY OF A CANOE FOUND FLOATING,
NOBODY IN IT, FISHERMAN DISAPPEARED...
THE AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION FROM EVERYBODY
WAS THAT IT WAS A CAIMAN OR AN ANACONDA.
THOSE ARE
THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATES.
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING
A BIT OF THINKING,
AND I THINK ANOTHER ANIMAL
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.
AND WHAT I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN...
IS ONE OF THESE.
NOW, I MEAN, THIS IS
A REAL ARMOR COAT, THIS,
AND IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S A SNAKE
OR SOME OTHER REPTILE.
BUT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS ACTUALLY
A FISH, AND THIS IS A BIG FISH.
THIS IS THE SKIN
OF AN ARAPAIMA FISH.
AND IF ITS SCALES
MAKE YOU THINK OF A DINOSAUR,
THAT'S BECAUSE THE ARAPAIMA
IS INDEED A DINOSAUR OF SORTS.
IT HAS SWUM IN THESE WATERS VIRTUALLY
UNCHANGED SINCE THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.
THAT IS JUST A SINGLE SCALE
FROM THIS ANIMAL.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
BUT THEY GO A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT,
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS...
THAT.
NOW, WHATEVER THAT CAME OFF, THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS RIVER MONSTER.
ARAPAIMA HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
MEASURING UP TO 10 FOOT LONG,
MAKING THEM THE LARGEST FRESHWATER
FISH IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST RIVER.
BUT IN RECENT YEARS, THEY HAVE
BEEN RELENTLESSLY OVERFISHED,
AND TODAY THEY ARE SO RARE, IT IS
FORBIDDEN TO CATCH THEM IN MOST AREAS.
HOWEVER,
THEY ARE POTENTIALLY FOUND
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTLESS THOUSAND MILES
OF RIVER THAT MAKE UP THE AMAZON BASIN...
AND I BELIEVE ARAPAIMA MAY BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR KILLING SOME OF THOSE MISSING PEOPLE.
MY MISSION IS TO INVESTIGATE THIS THEORY
AND SEE IF I CAN TRACK DOWN AND EVEN CATCH
ONE OF THESE POTENTIAL KILLERS.
I'VE BEGUN MY QUEST IN MANAUS,
THE WILD WEST FRONTIER TOWN
AT THE HEART
OF THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON.
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH,
AND FOR THAT, I'M GOING TO VISIT SOME CAPTIVE
ARAPAIMA, AND I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.
NORMALLY, IN THE AMAZON, SEEING
ARAPAIMA LIVE AND CLOSE UP
IS PRETTY WELL IMPOSSIBLE, THERE'S
JUST SO MUCH WATER. IT'S PRETTY MURKY.
HERE'S THIS PLACE.
IT'S A BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF MANAUS, AND
THIS COULD BE JUST THE PERFECT PLACE
TO CHECK THEM OUT.
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO GET
EYEBALL-TO-EYEBALL WITH THESE THINGS.
IT REALLY IS PREHISTORIC-LOOKING,
LIKE STONE OR METAL OR SOMETHING
IN A REAL ARMOR PLATING.
AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S
VERY STRIKING ABOUT THIS FISH...
THEY ARE VERY ELONGATED.
THEY'RE QUITE CYLINDRICAL.
THAT IS JUST PERFECT DESIGN
FOR AN AMBUSH PREDATOR...
YOU KNOW,
SPEED OVER A SHORT DISTANCE.
ARAPAIMA ARE NATURALLY PREDATORY, ENGULFING
ANY FISH THAT FIT INTO THAT BONY MOUTH,
INCLUDING PIRANHA.
THEY WILL EVEN CONSUME BIRDS
AND OTHER ANIMALS,
SUCKING THEM DOWN
FROM THE WATER'S SURFACE.
AND THEN THEY'VE GOT
THIS VERY GRUESOME TECHNIQUE
FOR ACTUALLY FINISHING
THEIR PREY OFF.
THEY HAVE A TONGUE
WITH A PIECE OF BONE INSIDE IT,
AND THEY ACTUALLY USE
THAT BONY TONGUE
TO CRUSH THE SMALL FISH
AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH.
SO IT'S NOT A VERY PLEASANT WAY
TO GO, I'D IMAGINE.
THESE ARE PRETTY BIG FISH.
YOU KNOW, THAT MOUTH ISN'T
BIG ENOUGH TO SWALLOW A PERSON,
SO ANY STORIES LIKE THAT,
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO DISCOUNT.
BUT IT COULD STILL
ACTUALLY KILL YOU.
THAT IS A VERY SOLID LUMP OF BONE WITH
AN ENORMOUS MASS OF MUSCLE BEHIND IT.
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ON THE RECEIVING
END OF ONE OF THESE THINGS.
IT HIT ME IN THE CHEST,
AND, NO EXAGGERATION,
I COULD STILL FEEL THAT
A MONTH AND A HALF LATER.
IT JUST BRUISED ME SO DEEPLY.
IT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO, AND I WAS HELPING
A FRIEND OF MINE, A RESEARCH SCIENTIST,
WITH HIS CAPTIVE-BREEDING
PROGRAM FOR ARAPAIMA.
HIS LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO TAKE THE
PRESSURE OFF THE WILD POPULATION,
AND HE NEEDED TO CAPTURE HIS FISH
TO PAIR THEM UP WITH LIKELY MATES.
WE CAUGHT SEVERAL FISH ALREADY, AND
WEIGHED AND MEASURED THEM WITHOUT PROBLEM
WHEN I LET MY GUARD DOWN.
WHILE DRAWING IN A NET WITH
AN ARAPAIMA TRAPPED INSIDE,
THIS HARD-NOSED GIANT TURNED
FROM FISH INTO MISSILE.
FROM NOWHERE, I HAD 100 POUNDS
OF SOLID BONE SMASH INTO ME.
WEEKS LATER, A DOCTOR DESCRIBED MY
INJURY AS SIMILAR TO THE IMPACT
OF STRIKING THE STEERING COLUMN
DURING A CAR CRASH.
I'M NOT SAYING
THIS IS SOME MALIGNANT CREATURE
THAT WILL DELIBERATELY HUNT
AND EAT YOU.
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE MOUTH
FOR IT.
BUT CORNER ONE OF THESE BEASTS, AND
IT WILL LAUNCH A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.
IT IS THIS EVENT THAT MAKES ME BELIEVE THE
ARAPAIMA MAY BE THE KILLER IN QUESTION.
IF THESE FISHERMEN WERE HUNTING ARAPAIMA
OR ACCIDENTALLY CAUGHT ONE IN A NET,
THIS ANIMAL
WILL VIOLENTLY DEFEND ITSELF.
JUST ONE THRASH
CONNECTING WITH THE HEAD
IS ALL IT WOULD TAKE TO KNOCK YOU
UNCONSCIOUS, LEAVING YOU AT THE MERCY
OF THE AMAZON'S SCAVENGING
RIVER MONSTERS.
IF I'M GOING TO INVESTIGATE THIS
THEORY, I NEED TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT MY EXPERIENCE
WASN'T A FREAK OCCURRENCE
AND ARAPAIMA DO HAVE THE POWER,
THE ABILITY,
AND EVEN THE INTENT
TO TAKE A FISHERMAN OUT.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I NEED TO
PROVE THAT DESPITE OVERFISHING,
THERE ARE STILL ARAPAIMA OUT THERE
LARGE ENOUGH TO DO THE DAMAGE.
AND THE BEST WAY I CAN DO THAT
IS BY CATCHING A GIANT ARAPAIMA.
BUT AS I SET OFF ON MY MISSION,
LEAVING THE PORT OF MANAUS,
MY BOAT CAPTAIN TELLS ME THAT
IF I'M INTERESTED IN ARAPAIMA,
THEN I SHOULD DEFINITELY VISIT
ONE OF THESE FLOATING HOUSES.
SALTED ARAPAIMA USED TO BE A
MEAL ENJOYED ACROSS THE AMAZON.
BUT SINCE A BAN
ON COMMERCIAL FISHING,
A FEW ENTERPRISING RIVERINOS,
OR RIVER PEOPLE,
HAVE STARTED TO FARM THEM
IN PENS LIKE THIS
TO SATISFY THE DEMAND
FOR ARAPAIMA MEAT.
I'VE HEARD THESE ARAPAIMA IN THIS ENCLOSURE
HERE DO SOMETHING QUITE SPECTACULAR.
I'VE ARRIVED JUST AS THEY'RE PREPARING TO
FISH ONE OUT FOR THEIR OWN COOKING POT.
JEREMY, JEREMY.
ALEGRIA.
ALEGRIA, EH?
ALEGRIA.
SENHOR ALEGRIA,
WHICH MEANS ""HAPPINESS,""
IS ABOUT TO TRY AND GET
AN ARAPAIMA OUT OF HERE.
THERE'S A FEW IN HERE.
AND HE SAYS
IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB.
IT CAN BE A WEE BIT INTERESTING.
I'M GOING TO ASK HIM
IF MAYBE I CAN HELP.
THERE ARE 30 FISH IN HERE, AND HE
SAYS THEY'RE JUST JUMPING EVERYWHERE,
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE JUST HAVING TO DUCK.
YOU RISK GETTING HIT
BY THE HEAD.
AND THIS IS ABOUT THE SIZE
OF A BOXING RING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE HAVING 30 PEOPLE COMING
AT YOU AND JUST HAVING TO AVOID THEM.
RIGHT, I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUST
PREPARE MYSELF A LITTLE BIT.
SUDDENLY, ALL MY OLD FEARS FROM
MY PAINFUL ENCOUNTER ARE BACK.
BUT IF I'M GOING TO CATCH AN
ARAPAIMA CAPABLE OF KILLING A MAN,
THEN I NEED TO FACE UP
TO MY FEAR.
AND IF THAT MEANS GETTING BACK INTO
THE WATER WITH ONE OF THESE BEASTS,
THEN THAT'S
WHAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO.
HAVING PREVIOUSLY HAD
A CRIPPLING PERSONAL ENCOUNTER,
I'M ON A MISSION TO SEE
IF I CAN ADD THE ARAPAIMA FISH
TO THE LIST OF AMAZON RIVER
MONSTERS WITH LETHAL POTENTIAL.
AND TO DO THAT, I NEED TO CATCH
ONE OF THESE GIANTS.
BUT BEFORE I TACKLE ONE IN THE
WILD, I NEED TO LAY THE GHOST
OF THAT EARLIER ENCOUNTER TO REST...
OH, I JUST TROD ON A FISH!
SO I'M HELPING THESE GUYS
NET A CAPTIVE ARAPAIMA.
AH, THIS IS T-T-T-T-THE... THIS
IS A BIT LIKE A BOXING RING.
IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE.
THERE'S 35 FISH IN HERE
NEARLY AS BIG AS I AM.
IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER OF NETTING ONE,
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING
WHEN I TOOK THE FULL FORCE OF AN
ARAPAIMA HEADBUTT TO THE CHEST.
AND I HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT THESE FISH
ARE PARTICULARLY VIOLENT WHEN CORNERED.
I'M WALKING FORWARD, WHICH MEANS ALL
THE VULNERABLE BITS OF ME BODY...
YOU KNOW, A BOXER WOULD BE
COVERING THEM UP.
OKAY,
THAT'S GOING WELL.
THEY'RE GONNA START JUMPING
ANY MINUTE, HE'S SAYING.
ANY MINUTE,
THEY'RE GONNA START JUMPING.
OKAY,
WE DIDN'T GET ONE.
GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE WHOLE THING AGAIN.
KNOWING WHAT'S COMING MAKES THE
SECOND ATTEMPT EVEN MORE DAUNTING.
I'M AFRAID.
""JEREMY IS AFRAID,"" HE'S SAYING.
I THINK THAT IS FAIRLY CLEAR
TO SEE.
HE'S SAYING THEY MIGHT BE A BIT TIRED
THIS TIME, SO THEY MIGHT... OH!
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WHEN
CORNERED OR TRAPPED BY NETS,
THE ARAPAIMA BECOMES
A FORMIDABLE FORCE OF NATURE.
WITH THE HELP OF THESE ARAPAIMA
FARMERS, I'M FINALLY HOLDING
ONE OF THESE INCREDIBLE FISH
IN MY ARMS.
LOOK AT THAT FIN.
AAH!
HEY!
MY FEAR HAS BEEN REPLACED
WITH A NEW RESPECT.
WE'RE GONNA LIFT IT UP.
MAYBE I'M NOW READY
TO FACE AN ARAPAIMA ON MY OWN.
NOW WE'RE GONNA
LET THE HEAD GO.
GONNA LET THE HEAD GO.
THIS IS THE... OOH!
THEY WANTED ONE TO EAT.
THAT ONE WAS TOO BIG.
THEY WANT TO GET
A SMALLER ONE.
I THINK I'M JUST GOING
TO LEAVE THEM TO IT.
OKAY.
NEVER, EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE...
ALL THOSE FISH ABSOLUTELY CLEAN
OUT OF THE WATER.
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT JUST HAS TO BE,
YOU KNOW, THE EVIDENCE
THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
JUST IMAGINE THE DAMAGE A FISH COULD
DO THAT HAD THE SAME SOLID-BONE HEAD
BUT WAS MORE THAN TWICE
THE WEIGHT.
BUT SENHOR ALEGRIA ALSO INSISTS THAT
THEY SNEAK THROUGH HOLES IN THE NETS,
DISPLAYING A CURIOUSLY
UNFISHLIKE CUNNING.
COMBINE THAT WITH
THEIR SHEER MUSCULAR POWER,
AND YOU CAN EASILY SEE HOW DANGEROUS
THE ARAPAIMA BECOMES WHEN CORNERED.
NOW I KNOW
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.
BUT TO CATCH ONE, IT'S GONNA BE A COUPLE
OF DAYS BY BOAT TO ONE OF THE FEW PLACES
WHERE ARAPAIMA FISHING
IS STILL ALLOWED.
AFTER A DAY'S TRAVELING, WE STOP AT A
RIVERSIDE TOWN TO SPEND THE NIGHT.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT
THE ARAPAIMA IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL DISAPPEARANCES
ON THE AMAZON.
THIS RIVER HAS A FULL COMPLEMENT OF
KILLERS, AS I'M POWERFULLY REMINDED
WHEN ASKING AROUND
FOR ANY FISHERMEN'S TALES.
THIS MAN LOST HIS WIFE
TO A HORRIFYING ATTACK
BY THE SOUTH AMERICAN COUSIN
OF THE ALLIGATOR... THE CAIMAN.
JUST YARDS AWAY, HIS POOR DAUGHTER
COULD ONLY HELPLESSLY LOOK ON.
THIS GENTLEMAN'S WIFE
WENT FISHING.
ON HER WAY BACK, THE BOAT ACTUALLY
SORT OF WENT OVER THE TOP OF A CAIMAN.
AAH!
MAE! MAE!
MAE!
IT HIT THE CANOE, TIPPED HER INTO THE
WATER, AND THEN BASICALLY GRABBED HER.
MAE!
THE CAIMAN HAD ACTUALLY
DRAWN AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE
BECAUSE OF THE COMMOTION
AND THE SHOUTING,
AND THEN HER DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO GO AROUND
THE OTHER SIDE AND PULL HER TO LAND,
BUT THEY JUST TOOK SO LONG
TO GET HELP
THAT DESPITE RESCUING HER MOTHER
FROM THE CAIMAN, YOU KNOW,
SHE DIED OF HER WOUNDS
LATER ON.
IT'S ONE THING TO HEAR
SECONDHAND STORIES ABOUT...
PEOPLE BEING TAKEN
BY ANIMALS IN THE WATER...
YOU KNOW, ALL VERY DRAMATIC
FISHERMEN'S TALES.
BUT TO ACTUALLY HEAR
FROM SOMEBODY
WHO ACTUALLY SAW THEIR MOTHER,
YOU KNOW, TAKEN IN FRONT OF THEM
JUST REALLY BRINGS HOME JUST WHAT A...
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PLACE THIS IS,
PARTICULARLY
IF YOU'RE A FISHERMAN.
SOMETHING I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IS
THAT IT'S NOT JUST DANGEROUS FISH
THAT YOU'VE GOT IN THE WATER,
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE ARRAY
OF OTHER NASTY,
DANGEROUS CREATURES DOWN THERE.
MY MISSION IS TO PROVE WHETHER
THE ARAPAIMA DESERVES A PLACE
ALONGSIDE THE AMAZON'S
UNDISPUTED FRESHWATER KILLERS.
AND AS I GO DEEPER INTO THE HEART OF
THE AMAZON IN SEARCH OF THIS FISH,
I ENCOUNTER THE OTHER CREATURES
THAT COME
WITH THIS INCREASINGLY
DANGEROUS TERRITORY.
BETWEEN 1918 AND 1924, THE AVERAGE ANNUAL
CATCH OF ARAPAIMA WAS ""C,"" 7,000 TONS...
THE WEIGHT OF 20 JUMBO JETS.
THIS LED TO THE COMMERCIAL EXTINCTION
OF THE ARAPAIMA IN THE WILD.
FISHERMEN THAT HUNT
THE ARAPAIMA FISH,
HERE IN THE AMAZON, REGULARLY EXPOSE
THEMSELVES TO RIVER MONSTERS THAT HAVE NO NEED
TO PROVE THEIR DEADLY NATURE.
I'VE HEARD A TALE OF A KILLER
CAIMAN IN THESE WATERS,
SO I HEAD OUT AFTER DARK
TO SEE IF I CAN FIND IT,
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
I'M THE ONE BEING WATCHED.
THERE ARE EYES
FOLLOWING MY EVERY MOVE.
I'M OUT AT NIGHT HUNTING CAIMAN.
THERE'S ONE IN THESE WATERS, APPARENTLY,
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY MAN-EATING SIZE.
THEY SAY IT'S CLOSE TO 20 FOOT.
CAIMANS' EYES REFLECT MY FLASHLIGHT,
MAKING THEM EASY TO SPOT.
OH, THERE'S ONE, THERE'S ONE, THERE'S
ONE, THERE'S ONE, THERE'S ONE!
SEEING HOW MANY CAIMAN THERE ARE IN THESE
WATERS MAKES ME REALIZE THAT IT IS
AS MUCH THE COMPANY THE ARAPAIMA KEEP
THAT MAKES THEM SUCH RISKY PREY TO HUNT.
THEIR FEARSOME DEFENSES ALLOW THEM TO
SURVIVE IN THESE PREDATORY WATERS.
BUT ALSO, AS THE ARAPAIMA BECOMES
RARER AND RARER, IT IS PUSHED DEEPER
INTO THE LITERALLY UNCHARTED
REACHES OF THE AMAZON.
THIS IS WHERE THE DEADLY FORCES OF NATURE
LURK, CIVILIZATION IS LEFT BEHIND,
AND ALL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
IS, WELL, BEYOND REACH.
BUT IF I'M TO CATCH A GIANT ARAPAIMA
AND LAY MY OWN DEMONS TO REST,
THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FACE
THESE OTHER MONSTERS, AS WELL,
AS I ENTER THE DARK HEART
OF THE AMAZON.
BEING SUCH A RARE ANIMAL NOWADAYS,
LIMITED AND SUSTAINABLE FISHING
IS ALLOWED IN JUST A FEW LOCATIONS,
AND THIS IS WHERE I'M HEADED.
I'M AS FAR OFF THE BEATEN TRACK AS
POSSIBLE, IN SEARCH OF THOSE LAST PLACES
WHICH STILL PROVIDE SANCTUARY
TO MONSTERS.
BASICALLY, THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD
GET UP HERE USING THE MOTOR.
TOO MANY BRANCHES AND ROCKS
IN THE WATER.
SO WE'RE HAVING TO MANHANDLE THE BOAT
UP THIS... THIS VERY NARROW CREEK.
WE'VE ENTERED A PRISTINE,
MAGICAL WORLD,
HOME TO MANY MYSTERIOUS
JUNGLE CREATURES...
AND MAYBE... MAYBE...
THE LARGE ARAPAIMA I'M AFTER.
AGH!
GOODNESS ME,
THAT IS A FISH AND A HALF!
LOOK AT THAT!
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CAPARARI.
OOP.
RIGHT. I'M ACTUALLY VERY PLEASED
TO HAVE THIS FISH.
IT'S NOT THE ARAPAIMA I WAS AFTER,
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST,
TO MY MIND,
SUCH A LOVELY-LOOKING FISH.
I MEAN, THE PATTERNING ON THAT
IS JUST WONDERFUL.
THIS BIZARRE CATFISH IS
A STRANGE MONSTER OF THE DEEP,
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARAPAIMA IS AN
ELUSIVE GIANT THAT WON'T BE CAUGHT EASILY.
WITH THE WEATHER TURNING, IT'S
TIME TO RETHINK MY OPTIONS.
MAYBE I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN
ADVISE ME WHERE EXACTLY IT'S BEST TO FISH.
AS I RACE AHEAD OF THE STORM,
DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE,
I'M REMINDED OF THE LEGEND THAT TELLS
HOW THIS MONSTER FISH CAME INTO BEING.
PIRARUCU WAS THE SON OF AN INDIAN
CHIEF, KNOWN TO BE CRUEL AND ARROGANT.
HE WAS DISRESPECTFUL OF THE GODS, SO THE
HIGHEST GOD, TUPA, DECIDED TO PUNISH HIM.
HE ORDERED STORMS TO ATTACK
PIRARUCU ON A FISHING TRIP,
BUT PIRARUCU LAUGHED THEM OFF.
SO TUPA STRUCK HIM DOWN WITH LIGHTNING...
DRAGGED HIM TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER,
AND TRANSFORMED HIM INTO A GIANT FISH...
THE ARAPAIMA, OR FIRE FISH,
ALTHOUGH, TO THIS DAY, BRAZILIANS
STILL CALL IT PIRARUCU.
IN THE WEST, WE HAVE LOST MUCH OF OUR
OLD REVERENCE FOR THE NATURAL WORLD,
BUT THERE ARE STILL
REMOTE TRIBAL PEOPLE
FOR WHOM REALITY AND MYTH
ARE ALMOST INTERCHANGEABLE.
THE TRIBES OF THIS REGION HAVE A
DEEP CONNECTION TO THE ARAPAIMA
AND ARE STILL ALLOWED
TO HUNT IT FOR FOOD.
SO IF I'M GOING TO TRACK ONE DOWN
AND LEARN FROM THE ANCIENT WAYS,
I'M TOLD THERE ARE NO BETTER
TEACHERS THAN THE MUNDURUKU PEOPLE.
I'M ON A MISSION TO CATCH THE
GIANT ARAPAIMA, OR FIRE FISH...
A FISH THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE
ON THE LIST OF RIVER MONSTERS
THAT CAUSE HUMAN FATALITIES
HERE IN THE AMAZON.
FROM EXPERIENCE BOTH PAST
AND PRESENT,
I KNOW JUST HOW POWERFUL
THIS CREATURE IS WHEN CORNERED.
TO PROVE THAT THERE ARE STILL
ARAPAIMA OUT THERE
THAT ARE BIG ENOUGH TO INFLICT A DEADLY
BLOW, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CATCH ONE.
GETTING TO GRIPS WITH ARAPAIMA
IN CAPTIVITY IS ONE THING,
BUT GETTING CLOSE TO THEM IN THE
WILD IS ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY,
PARTICULARLY NOW
THEY ARE SO ENDANGERED.
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
FURTHER UP THIS AMAZON BACKWATER
WHO DO HAVE A VERY ANCIENT
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ARAPAIMA,
AND I'M HOPING THAT WHEN I GET THERE, I'M
GOING TO FIND OUT AN AWFUL LOT MORE.
I'VE NOW BEEN TRAVELING
FOR SEVERAL DAYS.
IT FEELS LIKE I'M LIGHT-YEARS
FROM CIVILIZATION
WHEN I FINALLY TRACK DOWN
THE MUNDURUKU PEOPLE.
BOM DIA.
BOM DIA.
ALTHOUGH OFTEN DRESSED
IN WESTERN CLOTHES THESE DAYS,
THE MUNDURUKUS STILL RETAIN
THEIR CONNECTION TO WILDLIFE
AND TO THE MYTHS AND LEGENDS
OF OLD.
IT LOOKS LIKE I COULD BE HERE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.
A GOOD TIME IS RIGHT NOW
WHEN THE WATER'S DOWN
AND THE FISH
ARE ACTUALLY CONCENTRATED.
AHA-HA.
BUT LUNCH IS ON THE GO.
AND THIS FAR FROM CIVILIZATION, THE CREATURES
OF THE FOREST, LIKE THIS TARANTULA,
ARE AN EVERYDAY PART OF LIFE.
THAT IS A MONSTER.
THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE MONSTER.
I HOOK UP WITH MANOEL, ONE OF
THE VILLAGE'S TOP FISHERMEN.
HE'S GONNA TAKE ME OUT TO SEE IF
WE CAN SPOT SOME WILD ARAPAIMA.
I WANT TO LEARN ALL I CAN
ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR
AND NATURAL HAUNTS
OF THIS RIVER MONSTER
IF I'M GOING TO GIVE MYSELF THE BEST
CHANCE OF CATCHING A GOOD-SIZED ARAPAIMA.
WHAT MANOEL HAS JUST TOLD ME
IS THAT TO FISH FOR ARAPAIMA,
THE ONE THING THAT
YOU REALLY NEED IS PATIENCE,
AND I'M REALLY,
REALLY GETTING A SENSE OF THAT,
JUST DRIFTING SLOWLY, SLOWLY,
WATCHING FOR THAT ONE SIGN
OF THE FISH COMING UP
TO THE SURFACE.
ARAPAIMA ARE AIR-BREATHERS...
AN ADAPTATION THAT ALLOWS THEM
TO LIVE IN THE OXYGEN-DEPLETED LAKES
THAT FORM IN THE AMAZON'S DRY SEASON.
BUT IT IS ALSO A VITAL CLUE
FOR FISHERMEN.
EVERY TIME THEY BREAK THE SURFACE,
THEY GIVE AWAY THEIR PRESENCE.
AND WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY
NOT AFRAID OR AT ALL SPOOKED,
YOU KNOW, THAT COULD BE ACTUALLY QUITE
A GENTLE RIPPLE FOR SUCH A BIG FISH.
IT'S A SMALL SIGN, BUT IT
GIVES AWAY THEIR LOCATION.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT CAN BE
20 MINUTES OR MORE BETWEEN BREATHS,
SO PREDICTING WHERE THEY'RE GOING
TO COME UP NEXT IS NOT EASY.
SO, THERE YOU ARE ALL DAY UNDER THE
HOT SUN, AFTER THIS HUGE FISH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY IS THAT
DOWN THERE, THERE'S ALL THESE OTHER
DIFFERENT RIVER MONSTERS
IN THE WATER.
I'M OFTEN IN LARGE,
METAL-HULLED FISHING BOATS,
SO COMING DOWN TO WATER LEVEL
IN THESE TINY CANOES
MAKES YOU FEEL VERY EXPOSED
AND VULNERABLE.
I'M BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE THAT
HOW YOU SEE THE NATURAL WORLD
ENTIRELY DEPENDS
ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE.
WE'VE BEEN PADDLING AROUND HERE FOR A
FAIR OLD WHILE, AND HE'S ACTUALLY SEEN,
POINTED OUT
A COUPLE OF FISH SURFACING.
BUT TO BE HONEST, I ACTUALLY
COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING AT ALL.
I THINK I'VE GOT QUITE A WAY TO GO
UNTIL I PROPERLY GET MY EYE IN.
AS WE HEAD BACK TO THE VILLAGE,
MY GUIDE TELLS ME ABOUT ONE RIVER
MONSTER IN PARTICULAR THAT THEY FEAR.
IT'S CALLED THE COBRA-GRANDE...
THE BIG SNAKE.
I'VE HEARD
OF THIS MONSTER BEFORE,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
A MYTHICAL, OVERSIZED ANACONDA.
BUT I AM TOLD THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE
HERE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN IT
AND THAT A NEARBY VILLAGE
HAD TO TOTALLY RELOCATE
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO TERRIFIED
OF THE BIG SNAKE.
MANOEL HERE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN A
COBRA-GRANDE, AND IT WAS ACTUALLY ON LAND,
SO I'M VERY KEEN
TO GET THE DETAILS OF THIS.
THIS SOUNDS TO BE MORE THAN
JUST A BIG ANACONDA.
THIS WAS A HUGE ANIMAL...
IMMENSE SIZE, GREAT BIG HEAD.
AND THIS THING WAS BLACK, RED, AND YELLOW,
AND IT WAS MISSING ITS TAIL, APPARENTLY,
WHICH IS AN ODD DETAIL.
BUT HE OBVIOUSLY HAD
A VERY GOOD LOOK AT IT.
THE SNAKE WAS JUST LYING THERE,
LOOKING OUT OVER THE WATER,
THESE EYES LIKE SEARCHLIGHTS, AND
APPARENTLY ITS HEAD JUST COVERED IN BEES...
JUST BLACK WITH BEES, BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE ANIMAL JUST NOT BOTHERED AT ALL.
SOUNDS FARFETCHED, BUT HE
ACTUALLY SAW THIS HUGE ANIMAL,
JUST DOWN THE BANK FROM HERE.
HE TELLS ME THAT A FEW
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE
SAW THE COBRA-GRANDE
VERY RECENTLY.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
NOT TO BE MISSED.
I DECIDE TO PUT MY ARAPAIMA
HUNT ON HOLD
TO SEE IF ONE OF THE AMAZON'S MOST
UNBELIEVABLE MYTHS IS, IN FACT, REALITY.
I'VE COME TO MEET THE MUNDURUKU PEOPLE TO
TRY AND CATCH THE AMAZON'S BIGGEST FISH.
BUT AS I'VE BECOME IMMERSED
IN THEIR WORLD AND MYTHS,
I'VE DECIDED TO PUT MY ARAPAIMA
HUNT ON HOLD, TO FOLLOW UP A LEAD
THAT MIGHT REVEAL ANOTHER VAST RIVER
MONSTER... THE COBRA-GRANDE, OR BIG SNAKE.
I'M ON MY WAY UP A NARROW, WINDING
CREEK IN THE MIDDLE OF FLOODED FOREST,
EXCEPT AT THE MOMENT,
THE WATER IS VERY, VERY LOW.
AND I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE THE HOLE WHERE
A COBRA-GRANDE IS SUPPOSED TO LIVE.
THIS IS THE GIANT SNAKE
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT WAS JUST PURELY
A CREATURE OF MYTH.
BUT THEY SAID, ""NO, NO,
WE ARE TAKING YOU TO A PLACE""
WHERE PEOPLE SAY THERE IS ONE
ACTUALLY THERE NOW.""
I WAS INITIALLY SKEPTICAL, BUT
THEIR INSISTENCE IS INFECTIOUS.
IF ANYWHERE IS GOING TO BE
THE HOME OF A COBRA-GRANDE,
THIS PLACE CERTAINLY DOES HAVE
THAT KIND OF FEEL TO IT.
WE'RE HERE.
WITH THE AMAZON BASIN COVERING
SOME 2.7 MILLION SQUARE MILES,
THERE ARE, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, NEW
SPECIES WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED,
AND WHO KNOWS HOW BIG
SOME OF THESE ANIMALS MIGHT BE?
THEY SAID THAT THIS LINE HERE
IS A TRACK.
IF THIS ACTUALLY IS THE TRACK OF A
SNAKE, IT IS A BIG, HEAVY ANIMAL.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
A SERIOUSLY LARGE TRACK
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE
IN THE GROUND HERE.
ANACONDAS CAN REACH
AROUND 30 FEET.
IF THAT ISN'T A BIG SNAKE,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.
BUT THE LOCALS SAY COBRA-GRANDE
IS FAR BIGGER THAN AN ANACONDA.
YES?
THAT DOES ACTUALLY LOOK
LIKE THE HOME OF SOMETHING.
JUDGING BY THE SIZE
OF THE HOLES THERE,
YOU KNOW, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING PRETTY LARGE.
SO, HERE WE'VE GOT
A BIT OF SHED SNAKESKIN.
LET'S JUST PICK A BIT UP.
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE
THE INDIVIDUAL SCALES.
AT SOME POINT, QUITE A LARGE SNAKE
LAY HERE AND SHED ITS SKIN.
EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS QUITE UGLY,
THEY'RE SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED
THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HERE TODAY,
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE VERY, VERY DEFINITE SIGNS
THAT SOMETHING LARGE
IS AROUND THESE PARTS.
IF I'M TO FISH FOR A GIANT ARAPAIMA, THEN
I WILL BE ENTERING THE HOME OF MONSTERS.
MAYBE I WON'T MEET
THE COBRA-GRANDE ON THIS TRIP,
BUT I'M FINALLY GRASPING HOW MYTH AND
REALITY ARE INTERTWINED FOR THESE PEOPLE.
I'M SURE I COULD SPEND A LIFETIME
LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE ARAPAIMA
AND THE CREATURES THAT SHARE
ITS MYSTERIOUS WORLD,
BUT IT'S NOW TIME TO PUT ALL I
HAVE GATHERED INTO PRACTICE.
THIS IS ACTUALLY A PLACE WHERE
THE TRIBESPEOPLE AROUND HERE
USED TO COME BEFORE A BIG
BATTLE TO FOCUS THE MIND,
PREPARE THEMSELVES MENTALLY
BEFOREHAND.
AND, UM... I GUESS, AS I'M LIKELY TO
NEED ALL THE HELP THAT I CAN GET,
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA FOR ME TO
JUST SPEND A FEW MINUTES HERE, AS WELL.
I KNOW THAT IF I'M GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL,
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT
A FISH THAT, FOR THE LOCAL TRIBES,
IS THE INCARNATION OF A WARRIOR.
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY
PREPARED, IT'S GAME ON.
IT'S JUST ME, MY GUIDE JOHNNY, AND OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE, A VERY BIG FISH.
I'M PUTTING INTO PRACTICE
THE THINGS I'VE LEARNT,
NOT JUST
FROM THE FISH IN CAPTIVITY
BUT ALSO THE WHOLE BUSINESS ABOUT LOCATING
THE FISH, SPOTTING THEM, PATIENCE,
YOU KNOW,
GRADUALLY WORKING CLOSE
SO THAT YOU'RE IN A POSITION
OF GETTING ONE ON THE LINE.
WITH THE WATER SO LOW IN THIS
LAKE, OXYGEN LEVELS ARE DEPLETED.
THE ARAPAIMA'S AIR-BREATHING PHYSIOLOGY
IS BOTH ITS STRENGTH AND ITS WEAKNESS.
IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE MILLIONS OF YEARS
BEFORE THERE WERE HUNTERS LIKE ME AROUND
SCANNING THE WATER'S SURFACE
FOR THAT TELLTALE CLUE.
I'M TOLD THERE IS ANOTHER
SMALL LAKE IN THE FOREST,
WHERE MODERN LINE FISHING
IS ALLOWED FOR ARAPAIMA,
AS LONG AS IT'S CATCH
AND RELEASE.
WE CAN'T TAKE THE CANOE THERE,
BUT WE CAN GO ON FOOT.
AND THE FACT THAT
IT'S TUCKED AWAY A LITTLE BIT,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S GONNA BE SOMETHING
THAT I CAN GET A BAIT OUT OVER THERE.
YES! YES, YES, YES!
THAT'S A FISH.
I'VE HEARD TALES OF VARIOUS
AMAZON MONSTERS ON THIS JOURNEY,
SOME LEGENDARY, SOME
REAL, AND ALL DANGEROUS.
BUT THERE'S ONE CREATURE THAT,
DESPITE OVERFISHING,
I'D LOVE TO PROVE REALLY GROWS
TO MYTHIC PROPORTIONS.
IT'S THE ARAPAIMA... A FISH CAPABLE
OF KNOCKING A MAN FROM HIS CANOE
AND LEAVING HIM FOR DEAD.
BUT THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO PROVE
THESE MONSTERS ARE STILL OUT THERE
IS TO CATCH ONE, AND I'VE HEARD OF A LAKE
THAT MIGHT BE JUST THE PLACE TO DO THAT.
THIS LAKE LOOKS REALLY NICE,
ACTUALLY.
IT'S VERY QUIET.
LOTS OF SNAGS,
WHICH COULD BE INTERESTING.
I'M ACTUALLY USING...
A THING CALLED A CIRCLE HOOK.
NOW, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST
NOT GONNA HOOK ANYTHING AT ALL.
THE POINT JUST COMING IN HERE... THAT'S
JUST NOT GONNA HOOK ON ANYTHING.
BUT, IN FACT, IF THAT'S THE FISH'S MOUTH...
WHAT HAPPENS IS IT JUST COMES...
AND TURNS... AND THERE IT IS...
RIGHT IN THE CORNER OF THE MOUTH.
OH!
There we go. That was one.
I just saw this red tail
come up.
Fraction of a second,
but I recognize it now.
That was an arapaima.
And what I've got to do is try
and quietly get into position
so I can actually put a bait
near that fish.
One thing that I learned from the tribespeople,
which is actually quite hard to do,
but I've just got to be patient.
YES! YES, YES, YES!
AH, YEAH!
THAT'S A FISH.
THAT'S A GOOD FISH.
OH, HE'S UP.
I CAN SEE THE FISH.
AS THE BATTLE WITH THIS ARAPAIMA
APPROACHES THE HALF-HOUR MARK,
I'M REMINDED THAT THE REBELLIOUS,
PROUD SPIRIT THAT INHABITS THIS FISH
EVEN REFUSED
TO SURRENDER TO THE GODS.
RIGHT.
IT'S GOT TO BE OUT.
THERE WE GO.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
IT CAME OUT SO EASILY.
OKAY. WE'RE READY.
THERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THAT FOR A FISH.
LOOK AT THAT MASSIVE FEMALE ARAPAIMA...
ABOUT 150 POUNDS.
I FINALLY HAVE THE PROOF IN MY ARMS
THAT HUGE ARAPAIMA ARE STILL OUT HERE.
THIS IS A TRUE DINOSAUR
OF THE DEEP.
I NEED THIS FISH TO REGAIN ITS STRENGTH
AFTER OUR BATTLE BEFORE I RELEASE IT.
IF I PUT IT STRAIGHT BACK,
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ENERGY
TO SWIM TO THE SURFACE
TO TAKE A BREATH.
AND BEING AN AIR-BREATHER,
IT WOULD DROWN.
JUST THE HEAD A LITTLE BIT
UNDER THE WATER...
AND POINTING UP TOWARDS THE
BANK SO THAT IF IT DOES THRASH,
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY IT CAN GO, IN THEORY,
WHICH IS NOT BACK INTO THE WATER,
ALTHOUGH THEY CAN
JUST DOUBLE 'ROUND 180 DEGREES.
EVEN AT THE END OF A LONG FIGHT, I CAN
STILL FEEL THE STRENGTH OF THIS FISH.
SO I CAN ABSOLUTELY IMAGINE THIS THING
BEING ABLE TO... OH, THERE WE GO.
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD.
BOM.
THAT WAS THE FISH JUST HAVING
A BREATH, WHICH IS EXCELLENT.
IT MEANS THE FISH
IS NOT TOO TIRED OUT.
BUT, I MEAN, MAINLY,
THIS FISH IS JUST A BONY HEAD
WITH A BIG CYLINDER
OF MUSCLE BEHIND IT.
IF THIS FISH WASN'T TIRED OUT, I
DON'T THINK I'D BE ABLE TO HOLD IT.
THAT'S GOOD.
NO, IT'S GONE.
WE WERE JUST WONDERING
IF IT HAD ENOUGH STRENGTH TO GO,
AND NO DOUBT ABOUT IT...
I JUST COULDN'T HOLD IT.
AND IN FACT, AT THE END
OF AN EPIC BATTLE ON THE LINE
BUT ALSO AN EPIC QUEST TRYING
TO FIND ONE OF THESE THINGS...
BUT, YOU KNOW, FINALLY FEELING THE STRENGTH
OF IT, ABSOLUTELY, I'M IN NO DOUBT NOW
THAT IF YOU WERE IN A SMALL FISHING CANOE
AND THAT THING HIT YOU UNDERNEATH,
IT WOULD EASILY UPEND THE CANOE.
AND THEN, IF YOU WERE
IN THE WATER AFTERWARDS
AND YOU GOT ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THAT HEAD,
MY GOODNESS, THAT WOULD
ABSOLUTELY TAKE YOU OUT.
MYTHIC AND REAL BEASTS SWIRL AROUND
ONE ANOTHER HERE IN THE AMAZON.
WHEN PEOPLE GO MISSING, THERE IS
USUALLY TALK OF GIANT SNAKES...
AND MAN-EATING CAIMAN.
I SET OUT TO SHOW THAT THE ARAPAIMA
IS AN UNDERESTIMATED FISH,
CAPABLE OF EXTRAORDINARY FEATS
OF STRENGTH.
IF CORNERED, TRAPPED, OR NETTED, IT
BECOMES A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT...
AN AIRBORNE MISSILE.
I KNEW I HAD TO OVERCOME
MY FEAR TO PROVE MY CASE.
I WENT BACK INTO THE WATER
AND CAUGHT AN ANCIENT SURVIVOR
THAT IS PART FISH, PART LEGEND,
AND ENTIRELY WORTHY
OF A DEADLY REPUTATION.
NOW, THIS
IS A REAL RIVER MONSTER.","The wels catfish  ( or ; Silurus glanis), also called sheatfish or just wels, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a prized sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey.


== Etymology ==
The English common name comes from Wels, the common name of the species in German language. Wels is a variation of Old High German wal, from Proto-Germanic *hwalaz – the same source as for whale – from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kʷálos ('sheatfish').


== Evolution ==
The earliest known fossil remains of the wels catfish are from the late Miocene (about 5.3 million years ago) of Ukraine. Potentially slightly older but less well-preserved remains from 6-7 million years ago are also known from the same region. During this time period, the dominant catfish in eastern Europe appears to have been the modern Soldatov's catfish (S. soldatovi), now only found in eastern Asia, which was better adapted to the warmer climate. The wels catfish may have been restricted to a single refugium in the Ponto-Caspian region around this point. During the Pliocene, the wels catfish appears to have expanded its range and gradually supplanted Soldatov's catfish, up to the latter's extirpation from the region during the late Pliocene. It is thought that the more adaptable wels catfish was more tolerant to the cooling and drying trend over this period, and the increased seasonality caused by it. 


== Description ==
The wels catfish's mouth contains lines of numerous small teeth, two long barbels on the upper jaw and four shorter barbels on the lower jaw. It has a long anal fin that extends to the caudal fin, and a small sharp dorsal fin relatively far forward. The wels relies largely on hearing and smell for hunting prey (owing to its sensitive Weberian apparatus and chemoreceptors), although like many other catfish, the species exhibits a tapetum lucidum, providing its eyes with a degree of sensitivity at night, when the species is most active. With its sharp pectoral fins, it creates an eddy to disorient its victim, which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole. The skin is very slimy. Skin colour varies with environment. Clear water will give the fish a black color, while muddy water will often tend to produce green-brown specimens. The underside is always pale yellow to white in colour. Albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally. With an elongated body-shape, wels are able to swim backwards like eels.

The female produces up to 30,000 eggs per kilogram of body weight. The male guards the nest until the brood hatches, which, depending on water temperature, can take from three to ten days. If the water level decreases too much or too fast the male has been observed to splash the eggs with its tail in order to keep them wet.
The wels catfish is a long-lived species, with a specimen of 70 years old having been captured during a recent study in Sweden.


=== Size ===
The wels is one of the largest freshwater fish in Europe and Western Asia, only exceeded by the anadromous Atlantic and beluga sturgeon. Most adult wels catfish are about 1.3–1.6 m (4 ft 3 in – 5 ft 3 in) long; fish longer than 2 m (6 ft 7 in) are a rarity. At 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) they can weigh 15–20 kg (33–44 lb) and at 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) they can weigh 65 kg (143 lb).
Only under exceptionally good living circumstances can the wels catfish reach lengths of more than about 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Examples include the record wels catfish of Kiebingen (near Rottenburg, Germany), which was 2.49 m (8 ft 2 in) long and weighed 89 kg (196 lb). Even larger specimens have been caught in Poland (2,61 m 109 kg), the Czech Republic (2,64 m ), the Dnieper River in Ukraine, the Volga River in Russia, the Ili River in Kazakhstan, France, Spain (in the Ebro), Italy (in the Po and Arno), Serbia (in Gruža Lake, where a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) long specimen weighing 117 kg (258 lb) was caught on 21 June 2018 and the Danube river, where a catfish measuring 2.75 m (9.0 ft) and weighing 117 kg (258 lb) was caught at Đerdap gorge in the same year), and Greece, where this fish was introduced a few decades ago. Greek wels grow well thanks to the mild climate, lack of competition, and good food supply.

The heaviest authenticated specimen, captured from the river Po by a Hungarian fisherman in 2010, weighed 134.97 kg (297.6 lb), although there are recent anecdotal reports of larger wels exceeding 140 kg (300 lb). Meanwhile, the longest wels on record was an unweighed specimen from the Po measuring 2.85 m (9.4 ft), captured in 2023 .
The maximum total length may possibly exceed 3 m (9.8 ft) with a maximum weight of over 200 kg (440 lb). Such lengths are rare and unproven during the last century, but there is a somewhat credible report from the 19th century of a wels catfish of this size. Brehms Tierleben cites Heckl's and Kner's old reports from the Danube about specimens 3 m (9.8 ft) long and 200–250 kg (440–550 lb) in weight, and Vogt's 1894 report of a specimen caught in Lake Biel which was 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) long and weighed 68 kg (150 lb). In 1856, K. T. Kessler wrote about specimens from the Dnieper River which were over 5 m (16 ft) long and weighed up to 400 kg (880 lb). (According to the Hungarian naturalist Ottó Hermann [1835-1914], catfish of 300–400 kilograms were also caught in Hungary in the old centuries from the Tisza river.)
Exceptionally large specimens are rumored to attack humans in rare instances. This claim was investigated by extreme angler Jeremy Wade in an episode of the Animal Planet television series River Monsters following his capture of three fish, two of about 66 kg (145 lb) and one of 74 kg (164 lb), of which two attempted to attack him following their release. A report in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard on 5 August 2009, mentions a wels catfish dragging a fisherman near Győr, Hungary, under water by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold. The man reported he barely escaped from the fish, which he estimated to have weighed over 100 kg (220 lb).


=== Diet ===

Like most freshwater bottom feeders, the wels catfish lives on annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish. Larger specimens have also been observed to eat frogs, snakes, rats, voles, coypu and aquatic birds such as ducks, even cannibalising on other catfish. Researchers at the University of Toulouse, France, in 2012 documented individuals of this species in an introduced environment lunging out of the water to feed on pigeons at water edge.  28% of the beaching behaviour observed and filmed in this study were successful in bird capture. Stable isotope analyses of catfish stomach contents using carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 revealed a highly variable dietary composition of terrestrial birds. This is likely the result of adapting their behaviour to forage on novel prey in response to new environments upon its introduction to the river Tarn in 1983 since this type of behaviour has not been reported within the native range of this species. They can also eat red worms in the fall, but only the river species.
The wels catfish has also been observed taking advantage of large die-offs of Asian clams to feed on the dead clams at the surface of the water during the daytime. This opportunistic feeding highlights the adaptability of the wels catfish to new food sources, since the species is mainly a nocturnal bottom-feeder.


== Distribution and ecology ==
The wels catfish lives in large, warm lakes and deep, slow-flowing rivers. It prefers to remain in sheltered locations such as holes in the riverbed, sunken trees, etc. It consumes its food in the open water or in the deep, where it can be recognized by its large mouth. Wels catfish are kept in fish ponds as food fish.

An unusual habitat for the species exists inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone, where a small population lives in abandoned cooling ponds and channels at a close distance to the decommissioned power plant. These catfish appear healthy, and are maintaining a position as top predators in the aquatic ecosystem of the immediate area.


=== As introduced species ===
There are concerns about the ecological impact of introducing the wels catfish to regions where it is not native.  Following the introduction of wels catfish, populations of other fish species have undergone steep declines. Since its introduction in the Mequinenza Reservoir in 1974, it has spread to other parts of the Ebro basin, including its tributaries, especially the Segre River. Some endemic species of Iberian barbels, genus Barbus in the Cyprinidae that were once abundant, especially in the Ebro river, have disappeared due to competition with and predation by wels catfish. The ecology of the river has also changed, with a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae.
The wels catfish may have established a population in Santa Catarina, Brazil. They were imported from Hungary in 1988 and were washed into the Itajaí-Açu river after a flood caused their tanks to overflow. In 2006, a specimen weighing 86 kg (189.5 lbs) and 1.85 m (6 ft) long was captured in Blumenau, suggesting the catfish have survived and possibly be reproducing.


=== Conservation status ===
Although Silurus glanis is not considered globally endangered, the conservation status varies across the species native distribution range. In the northern periphery of the distribution, the species has been declining over the last centuries and was extinct from Denmark in the 1700s and from Finland in the 1800s. In Sweden it persists only in a few lakes and rivers, and is now considered as near threatened. Recent genetic studies have furthermore found that the Swedish populations harbors low genetic diversity and are genetically isolated and differentiated from each other, highlighting the need for conservation attention.


== As food ==

Only when younger is the wels generally valued as food. The flesh is more palatable when the fish weighs less than 15 kg (33 lb). Larger than this size, the fish is highly fatty and additionally can be loaded with toxic contaminants through bioaccumulation due to its position at the top of the food chain. Large specimens are not recommended for consumption, but are sought out as sport fish due to their combativeness. A common lure for Wels catfish is a clonk, which when dropped in the water produces a distinct sound that induces them to bite.


== Attacks on people ==
Tabloids regularly report attacks caused by various catfish that primarily affected animals (often only the role of the catfish was presumed). In April 2009, an Austrian fisherman was allegedly attacked by a catfish in one of the fishing lakes in Pér, near Győr, Hungary. However, the man reportedly managed to break free.
The Wels was the subject of an episode in the first season of the documentary television show River Monsters. Host Jeremy Wade concluded that Wels catfish in the area were not large enough to consume adult human beings, but could easily swallow a child. Wade documented instances of Wels catfish being aggressive towards humans, including a Wels he had just caught that ""double[d] round"" and attempted to bite his calf.
Similar stories occur in the works of older natural history writers. Alfred Brehm (1829–1884), a German naturalist, published his famous work The World of Animals in the 19th century. It was also translated into Hungarian at the beginning of the 20th century. In this, Brehm or the compiling Hungarian scientists write the following: 

""Old Gesner’s (Conrad Gessner Swiss naturalist, 1516–1565) claim that catfish doesn’t spare humans either doesn’t just belong in the realm of tales, as we know of several cases that confirm that. Thus, Heckel and Kner mention that a catfish was caught at Bratislava, in the stomach of which the remains of a child corpse were found. [...] Fishermen credible to Antipa (probably Romanian zoologist Grigore Antipa, 1866–1949) told me that children bathing in the stomachs of catfish were caught in the bones of their hands and feet. - Communicates Vutskits (probably Hungarian zoologist hu:Vutskits György, 1858–1929). - A Romanian fisherman penetrated the middle of the Danube with his boat because he wanted to take a bath. While bathing, a catfish caught his legs, which he could no longer pull out of the mouth of this big-mouthed monster, and so he got to the bottom of the water. A few days later, they came across the corpse of a dead fisherman whose legs were still in the catfish's mouth, but even the greedy robber could not release his victim's legs and drowned because of it"".
In June 2025 a Wels was shot at by a police officer after it had bitten five people in the Brombachsee in northern Bavaria. The incident attracted media attention and sparked outrage on social media. According to the police trying to kill the fish was necessary as it posed a threat to swimmers in the lake and to the guests of the Burning Beach electronic music festival nearby. The injured fish was retrieved by fishermen, and killed. The animal rights group PETA plans to file charges against the local fishing association and police department on claims that the killing was in breach of nature conservation laws.

Differs further from the following combination of features:  body naked; large, depressed head; dorsal fin with 2-4½  rays; caudal fin rounded or truncate; no adipose fin; and anal rays almost touching caudal (Ref. 59043 ).  Caudal fin with 17 rays (Ref. 2196 ). Body shape ( shape guide ): elongated. Biology Glossary (e.g.  epibenthic) The maximum length of the species has been recorded as 5 m for a long time and the maximum weight as 306 kg . It has been demonstatred that misidentifications and problems of measurment units have led to these numbers.  The recorded maxima with evidence are 2.73 m and 130 kg (Ref. 123627 ).  Inhabits large and medium size lowland rivers, backwaters and well vegetated lakes (Ref. 59043 ).  Occurs mainly in large lakes and rivers, though occasionally enters brackish water in the Baltic and Black Seas (Ref. 9988 ).  Found in deep waters of dams constructed on the lower reaches of rivers (Ref. 9696 ).  A nocturnal predator, foraging near bottom and in water column.  Larvae and juveniles are benthic, feeding on a wide variety of invertebrates and fish. Adults prey on fish and other aquatic vertebrates. Attains first sexual maturity at 2-3 years of age (Ref. 59043 ).  Spawns in the salt water of the Aral Sea (at Kulandy) (Ref. 1441 ).  Marketed fresh, canned and frozen; can be pan-fried and baked (Ref. 9988 ). Locally threatened due to river regulation destroying shallow spawning sites (Ref. 59043 ). Life cycle and mating behavior Maturity | Reproduction | Spawning | Eggs | Fecundity | Larvae Males defend small territories in the spawning sites and construct nests made of plant materials.  They dig shallow depressions or clean spawning substrate such as willow ( Salix ) and roots.  Males guard the nests until larvae emerge.  Spawns in pairs. Eggs hatch in 2-3 days.  Larvae live in the nest until yolk sac is absorbed for 2-4 (Ref. 59043 ).  Eggs are surrounded by a mucous and adherent wrapping. Incubation lasts about 50 hours at 24°C.

Amazon Assassins,Arapaima,Arapaima gigas,"THE AMAZON RIVER IS KNOWN FOR CONTAINING
AN EVIL COLLECTION OF MURDEROUS BEASTS.
BUT THERE'S ONE FAMILY OF FISH
LIVING HERE
THAT COULD WRITE
A SERIAL KILLER'S HANDBOOK,
THEIR METHODS ARE
SO BLOODTHIRSTY AND VARIED.
I CAN SEE FROM HERE
THE WAY THEY ARE JUST
LITERALLY DRILLING THEIR WAY
INTO THAT FISH.
MEMBERS OF THE CATFISH FAMILY HAVE
REPORTEDLY SWALLOWED PEOPLE WHOLE.
THEY'VE EATEN THEM ALIVE FROM WITHIN, AND
EVEN GRUESOMELY PENETRATED INDIVIDUALS
IN THE MOST INTIMATE OF PLACES.
I'M JEREMY WADE... FISH ON!
BIOLOGIST
AND EXTREME ANGLER.
AND I'M ON THE HUNT FOR THESE KILLER
CATFISH TO DETERMINE IF THIS FAMILY
ARE THE AMAZON'S
ULTIMATE RIVER MONSTERS.
NOW, IMAGINE THAT
IN AN ORIFICE.
IN THE HEART OF THE BRAZILIAN
AMAZON, A TRUCK MAKES A SOLEMN PATH
TOWARDS
THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.
IT CARRIES A MACABRE LOAD...
THE CORPSE OF A MAN.
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH
WERE BIZARRE IN THE EXTREME.
FEARING ACCUSATIONS OF MURDER,
THE FISHERMEN HAVE TAKEN
THE CORPSE TO THE POLICE STATION
IN THE EXACT STATE
IN WHICH THEY FOUND IT...
JUST A PAIR OF LEGS PROTRUDING
FROM THE MOUTH OF A VAST CATFISH.
COULD THIS WILD TALE EMERGING
FROM THE AMAZON REALLY BE TRUE?
OR IS THIS JUST A MADE-UP
FISHERMAN'S TALE,
AND NO MORE REAL THAN THIS PHOTO RE-CREATION
OF WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE?
I'VE FACED MANY OF THE LARGEST
AND MOST FEARED CREATURES
IN THE WATERWAYS OF THIS WORLD,
AND I'VE DISCOVERED THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO
SWIM IN THE SEA TO ENCOUNTER A MAN-EATER.
RIVERS HARBOR
JUST AS MANY MONSTERS.
ASK PEOPLE WHAT IS THE MOST
FEARED FISH IN THE AMAZON,
AND THEY'LL UNDOUBTEDLY SAY PIRANHA...
ELECTRIC EEL...
OR EVEN STINGRAY.
BUT I'VE COME TO BRAZIL TO FIND OUT IF
CATFISH ARE ACTUALLY THE WORST OF THE LOT,
A TRUE MAFIA-STYLE FAMILY
OF KILLERS AT LARGE.
AND I'VE TRACKED DOWN SIL VAL MIR, ONE
OF THE WITNESSES TO THIS BIZARRE MURDER,
TO HEAR HIS STORY.
BASICALLY, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A
FRENZY OF FISHING ACTIVITY GOING ON.
ONE OF THE NETS
GOT STUCK ON A ROCK,
AND IN THAT SITUATION, THE ONLY THING YOU
CAN DO... IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA RIP THE NET,
YOU'VE GOT TO GO DOWN
AND GET IT OFF.
SO THIS ONE FISHERMAN DIVED IN
TO FREE THE NET.
HOWEVER, WHAT HAPPENED
WAS THAT HE DIDN'T COME UP.
THE NET CAME UP...
NO FISH IN IT, NO FISHERMAN.
NOTHING MORE WAS SEEN
UNTIL ABOUT FOUR HOURS LATER,
WHEN SUDDENLY, THIS HUGE FISH APPEARED ON
THE SURFACE, AND IT WAS THRASHING AROUND
BECAUSE THE FISH WAS ACTUALLY ITSELF
IN TROUBLE, ACTUALLY CHOKING.
THE FISHERMAN WAS ACTUALLY HALF
INSIDE THE MOUTH OF THE FISH,
JUST THE LEGS OF THE FISHERMAN
STICKING OUT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN WAS THAT THE
FISHERMEN ALL WENT TO TRY AND GET THE FISH,
TO NET IT, AND HE SAID BECAUSE
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY QUITE TIRED,
IT WAS QUITE EASY,
JUST ONE NET.
THEY GOT IT IN
AND CLUBBED IT TO DEATH.
THEY LEFT HIS BODY INSIDE THE FISH AND
THEN WENT TO MANAUS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW,
GET IT TO THE POLICE STATION
TO MAKE SURE
THAT THERE'S NO SUSPICION
THAT IT WAS A CASE OF MURDER
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
THE MURDERER
WAS IDENTIFIED AS A PIRAíBA...
THE LARGEST SPECIES OF CATFISH
FOUND HERE IN THE AMAZON.
SO THAT FISH COULD HAVE BEEN
ABOUT 500 POUNDS.
I MEAN, WE ARE TALKING SOME
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY BIG FISH HERE.
THE MOUTH...
ABOUT 40 CENTIMETERS ACROSS.
THAT'S A COUPLE OF FOOT ACROSS.
BUT HE SAYS IT OPENS UP MORE,
SO MAYBE 2 1/2 FOOT.
THIS WAS
A PRETTY MONSTROUS FISH,
AND A PRETTY HORRIFIC END
FOR THAT PARTICULAR FISHERMAN.
HE SAYS THERE ARE PEOPLE
DISAPPEARING ALL THE TIME,
AND YOU NEVER
FIND A TRACE OF THEM.
YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T FIND THE BODY.
YOU DON'T FIND BONES.
YOU DON'T FIND ANYTHING.
EVEN HAVING HEARD THIS HORRIFIC
STORY FROM AN EYEWITNESS,
SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY THERE, SEEING THIS
MONSTROUS FISH WITH THE FISHERMAN'S FEET
JUST POKING OUT OF THE MOUTH, I STILL
FIND IT REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT THERE ARE FISH HERE
CAPABLE OF DOING THAT.
AND WHAT I WANT TO DO
IS ACTUALLY SEE MY OWN EYES
HOW BIG THE FISH ARE
IN THESE AMAZON RIVERS.
I THINK THE FIRST THING I'VE GOT TO DO IS
GO BACK TO WHERE THIS STORY ALL STARTED
AND ACTUALLY GO MYSELF
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
VAL MIR TALKED OF SEEING A 500-POUND
PIRAíBA, WHICH SEEMS EXTREME,
BUT PHOTOS DO EXIST
OF SOME PRETTY LARGE CATFISH.
THERE ARE THREE SPECIES OF GIANT CATFISH
FOUND HERE IN THE AMAZON... THE JAú...
THE RED-TAILED CATFISH...
AND THE PIRAíBA.
THIS CATCH WAS REPORTED TO BE NEARLY
8 FOOT LONG AND SOME 350 POUNDS.
BUT MAYBE, AS VAL MIR SUGGESTS, THERE
ARE EVEN BIGGER MONSTERS OUT THERE,
AND IF I FOLLOW HIS LEADS, PERHAPS I'LL
GET TO CATCH A MAN-EATER OF MY OWN.
AFTER TRAVELING FOR 12 HOURS,
I REACH MY DESTINATION,
A RIVER JUNCTION UP A TRIBUTARY
OF THE AMAZON.
AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER,
THIS IS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THIS IS A
VERY OBVIOUS MEETING OF THE WATERS.
YOU CAN SEE IT SO CLEARLY
BECAUSE THE TWO RIVERS THAT
MEET HERE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS.
ONE IS MUDDY WHITE WATER.
ONE IS BLACK WATER.
ACCORDING TO THE LOCALS, LARGE CATFISH WAIT
IN AMBUSH AT RIVER JUNCTIONS LIKE THIS
TO PREDATE ON SMALLER FISH
TRAVELING DOWNRIVER.
BECAUSE I'M AFTER A PRETTY MONSTROUS
FISH, I'M USING MONSTROUS TACKLE.
I'VE GOT A HUGE FORGED-STEEL HOOK ON
THE END, ATTACHED TO A LENGTH OF WIRE,
AND THEN I'VE GOT ABOUT
300 YARDS OF VERY STRONG LINE.
OKAY.
AND THIS ROD... YOU'D NORMALLY
ONLY SEE THIS ON A BOAT
OUT IN THE OPEN OCEAN,
THE KIND OF THING YOU'D USE
TO CATCH MARLIN, TUNA,
THAT KIND OF THING.
BUT I'M USING THIS STUFF
IN FRESHWATER.
PEOPLE ONLY THINK OF PREDATORY
FISH LIVING IN THE SEA,
BUT HERE I AM ABOUT 1,000 MILES
FROM THE OCEAN,
STAKING OUT A CRIME SCENE
TO CATCH A MAN-EATER.
SOMETHING DOWN THERE.
JUST GRABBED THE BAIT... BENT THE ROD...
AND THEN LET GO.
THAT'S A FISH ON.
THAT'S A FISH ON.
IT'S TAKING LINE.
TAKING LINE, TAKING...
FEELS PRETTY SIZABLE.
WE'LL BE A LITTLE DECISIVE
AND BRUTAL NOW.
THE FISH DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW
THAT, DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW.
GOING DOWN.
THE FISH IS COMING UP
IN THE WATER... UP IN THE WATER.
THERE IT IS.
IT'S A JAú.
IT'S A GOOD SIZE.
THIS FISH IS NOT THE PIRAíBA I WAS
HOPING FOR, BUT THE JAú IS A CATFISH,
AND SOME FISHERMEN CLAIM IT CAN BE JUST
AS DANGEROUS AS THE LARGER PIRAíBA.
BUT IT'S NOT FINISHED.
IT DOESN'T LIKE THE SIZE
OF THE BOAT AT ALL.
IT HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING
SO STRONG ON THE END OF A LINE
THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT IT HAS
DRAGGED FISHERMEN DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS.
THIS IS ABOUT 80 POUNDS.
80, 90 POUNDS.
IT'S A GOOD-SIZED FISH.
THE HOOK HOLD LOOKS GOOD.
MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO LAND IT
ON LAND.
AFTER 20 MINUTES OF HARD STRUGGLE,
I HAVE THE BETTER OF IT.
AND, MY GOODNESS, FEELING
THE STRENGTH OF THIS THING,
I WOULDN'T WANT THAT 'ROUND MY ANKLE OR...
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE HEADFIRST
DOWN THE MOUTH
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT, EITHER.
THERE WE GO.
IT LOOKS A REALLY SINISTER FISH, THAT DARK
BLACK COLOR, AND IT GETS THAT FROM...
IT GETS THAT FROM LIVING DOWN IN THE
LIGHTLESS ZONE, DEEP IN THE ROCKY POOLS,
WHERE IT JUST BLENDS IN
WITH THE BACKGROUND.
AND PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT IT
FROM HERE, JUST THE SHAPE OF IT,
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A GREAT BIG MOUTH, LARGE HEAD.
VERY MUSCULAR MIDRIFF, AND
THEN JUST TAPERING OFF
INTO THIS VERY CHUNKY,
POWERFUL PROPULSION UNIT.
JUST LOOKING AT THESE LONG WHISKERS THAT
THEY USE TO PROBE THEIR SURROUNDINGS,
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHERE CATFISH GET THEIR NAME.
SO, THIS IS A REAL...
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A FISH
THAT'S ADAPTED FOR STRONG
WATER... VERY STRONG FISH.
AND IF ONE OF THOSE
WAS TO GRAB YOU...
THERE'S NOT A GREAT DEAL
YOU COULD DO ABOUT IT.
TIME TO RELEASE THIS ANIMAL.
SO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME MAY NOT HAVE
YIELDED THE MAN-EATING PIRAíBA I WAS AFTER,
BUT THIS IMPRESSIVE JAú SHOWS THAT THERE
ARE SOME LARGE CATFISH DOWN THERE.
OH, WANTING TO GO ALREADY.
WANTING TO GO ALREADY.
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.
THERE IT GOES.
OOH.
QUITE A FISH.
IF I CAN GET A BIG CATFISH HERE AT THIS MINOR
RIVER JUNCTION, THEN PERHAPS IF I FISH
THE LARGEST RIVER JUNCTION IN THE WORLD...
THE MEETING OF THE WATERS NEAR MANAUS...
I'LL LAND THE MOTHER
OF ALL CATFISH.
I'M ON A MISSION TO HOOK THE LARGEST
CATFISH IN THE AMAZON, THE PIRAíBA,
'CAUSE I WANT TO PROVE THAT THE STORIES
ABOUT THEM SWALLOWING FISHERMEN
ARE MORE THAN JUST
FISHERMEN'S TALES.
AND AFTER CATCHING A LARGE JAú
AT A RIVER JUNCTION,
I THINK I KNOW JUST THE PLACE
TO CATCH A MONSTER.
THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE MEETING
OF THE WATERS.
THIS IS THE BLACK WATER, THE
RIO NEGRO, COMING DOWN HERE,
MIXING WITH THE WHITE,
MUDDY WATER OF THE RIO SOLIMOES.
AND TOGETHER,
THEY FORM THE MIGHTY AMAZON.
AND THIS HAS TO BE PROBABLY THE
BIGGEST RIVER JUNCTION IN THE WORLD,
AND EVERYBODY SAYS THAT THE BIG
CATFISH, THEY LOVE RIVER JUNCTIONS,
SO THIS PLACE HAS TO BE A GOOD BET
FOR THE MOTHER OF ALL CATFISH.
THE POINT WHERE THESE TWO RIVERS
MEET IS MORE THAN A MILE WIDE,
OVER 200 FEET DEEP IN PLACES.
AND FOR ALMOST ANOTHER FOUR MILES, THESE
TWO MASSIVE WATERWAYS REFUSE TO MERGE,
DUE TO THEIR DIFFERENT SPEEDS,
TEMPERATURES, AND SEDIMENT CONTENTS.
JULIO CAVALCANCHE HAS CAUGHT A 211-POUND
PIRAíBA AT THE MEETING OF THE WATERS.
BUT ON ANOTHER OCCASION, HE NEARLY DIED
HERE WHEN THE LINE WRAPPED AROUND HIS BODY
AND STARTED TO PULL HIM
OUT OF THE BOAT.
HE HAD TO CUT HIMSELF FREE
WITH THIS VERY KNIFE.
JULIO CREDITS
HIS FISHING SUCCESS
TO A SECRET BAIT FORMULA THAT HE WRAPS
AROUND A HOOK, SEALS IN A TIN CAN,
AND LEAVES TO BAKE IN THE SUN
FOR THREE DAYS.
OOH.
OH, DEAR.
UGH.
I THINK MOST OF THE FISH IN THIS RIVER
ARE GONNA KNOW THAT STUFF IS IN THERE.
LOOK HERE.
RIGHT.
THAT... MMM.
THAT JUST LOOKS SO... UGH.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
QUITE LIKE THAT.
RIGHT.
THE FISH LIKE IT.
THE FISH LIKE IT.
THIS IS THE GUTS, THE
BY-PRODUCTS, OF EIGHT CHICKENS.
SO, THE ENTIRE INTESTINES OF ONE CHICKEN
IS ABOUT THAT LONG, WOUND ROUND,
AND YOU'VE GOT EIGHT ENTIRE INTESTINAL
TRACTS OF CHICKENS TO MAKE UP THAT BAIT.
I THINK WITH THIS NOW, I HAVE
TO BE READY TO GO FISHING.
JULIO RECKONS THAT ONCE THE SUN SETS AND
NIGHT FALLS, THE CATFISH COME OUT TO FEED.
THAT'S THE BAIT
ON A HUGE HOOK.
LUMP OF LEAD
TO KEEP IT DOWN.
I'LL FEED THIS OVER THE SIDE.
I'VE GOT 30 FOOT OF IRON CABLE.
FEELS GOOD. THE MONSTERS
COULD BE ON THE MOVE.
HOW'S THIS
FOR FLOAT FISHING?
I'VE GOT A BARREL ON HERE.
I MEAN, THIS IS A ""JAWS"" MOMENT
IF EVER THERE WAS ONE.
THE BAIT'S OUT.
THE ENGINE'S CUT.
IT'S NOW JUST A CASE OF BEING QUIET AND
JUST DRIFTING DOWN WITH THE CURRENT.
BUT BEING OUT HERE AFTER DARK
ALSO INCREASES THE RISKS.
HERE, YOU'VE NOT ONLY GOT
A VERY, VERY POWERFUL FISH
THAT MIGHT HANG ON THE END
OF THE LINE,
YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO KEEP
AN EYE OUT FOR THE WEATHER,
AND ALSO, THIS IS
A VERY, VERY BUSY WATERWAY.
THERE'S GONNA BE BOATS,
BIG BARGES, ALL SORTS OF STUFF.
AND THEY'LL JUST RUN YOU OVER
IF YOU GIVE THEM A CHANCE
IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF THE WAY.
AND 30 FOOT BELOW ALL THAT
IS MY BAIT.
THE WATER UNDERNEATH ME
COULD BE 200 FEET DEEP.
BUT THE PIRAíBA, WHOSE NAME MEANS
""MOTHER OF ALL THE FISHES,""
IS TOTALLY AT HOME HERE.
WITH A LIGHTNING-CONDUCTING
ROD IN MY HANDS,
I'M EASILY THE HIGHEST POINT
IN THIS WIDE STRETCH OF RIVER.
SO I DECIDE TO CALL IT A DAY
BEFORE THAT STORM GETS ANY CLOSER.
AH.
WELL, NOTHING...
NOTHING CAME FOR THAT BAIT.
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I CAN'T BLAME THEM.
EITHER IT'S JUST NOT MY NIGHT OR THE
FACT THAT IT IS SO CLOSE TO A BIG CITY
MEANS THAT THE FISH
HAVE ALL BEEN FISHED OUT.
THERE IS A HUGE FISHING FLEET
OPERATING FROM MANAUS,
AND THIS IS
RIGHT ON THE DOORSTEP.
PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, I NEED TO GO
FURTHER AWAY FROM CIVILIZATION
IF I'M TO GET
THE MOTHER OF ALL THE CATFISH.
I HEAD INTO THE DARK HEART OF THE AMAZON,
UP A DISTANT TRIBUTARY OF THE MAIN RIVER,
TO SEE IF THAT TACTIC
CHANGES MY LUCK.
MAYBE HERE I'LL CATCH
MY MAN-EATING PIRAíBA.
HEAD DOWN, HEAD DOWN, HEAD DOWN,
HEAD DOWN, HEAD DOWN!
ARGH!
FISH ON!
COULD THIS BE
THE RIVER MONSTER I'M AFTER?
BUT WHO'LL WIN THIS BATTLE...
ME OR THE FISH?
I ASKED WHAT IS THE WORST THING THAT HAS
EVER HAPPENED TO ME ON A FISHING TRIP.
THE ANSWER IS ALL THREE.
I SURVIVED A PLANE CRASH
UNSCATHED IN THE AMAZON,
I CAUGHT MALARIA
AND NEARLY DIED IN THE CONGO,
AND I WAS ARRESTED AND INTERROGATED AS A
SUSPECTED SPY ON THE THAI/LAOS BORDER.
I'M HERE IN THE AMAZON, INVESTIGATING
A FAMILY OF KILLER CATFISH.
IT'S TAKING LINE.
IT'S A STRONG FISH, THIS.
AND I THINK I'VE HOOKED
A PIRAíBA...
COME 'ROUND, GONNA COME 'ROUND,
GONNA COME 'ROUND.
THE LARGEST CATFISH SPECIES
FOUND HERE.
THIS IS A GOOD-SIZED FISH.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.
LOOK AT THAT!
THAT IS ACTUALLY
NOT THE FISH I WANT.
THAT IS A HUGE
RED-TAILED CATFISH.
I WANT THE WHITE STREAMLINED,
SHARKLIKE PIRAíBA.
BUT THIS THING, MY GOODNESS...
THIS IS A GOOD SIZE.
THIS IS A VERY GOOD SIZE.
OH!
NOW THAT THIS FISH IS IN THE BOAT, IT IS
PUMPING AIR, NOT WATER, OVER ITS GILLS,
CREATING THESE STRANGE SOUNDS.
THAT IS A BIG OLD CATFISH.
AND IT'S GETTING ME IN TRAINING
FOR THE PIRAíBA.
THE ONLY THING IS, TOO MANY MORE
EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS ONE,
AND I JUST WON'T HAVE ANY ENERGY FOR
A FISH THAT'S BIGGER THAN THIS.
AND, I MEAN, THIS THING IS JUST
A HUGE HEAD, HUGE, BONY HEAD,
TAPERING OFF INTO THIS LEATHERY BODY,
AND A GREAT, BIG WIDE MOUTH THERE.
WITHOUT ANY TEETH, AS SUCH, BUT
IT'S GOT REAL GOOD GRASPING PADS.
UNLIKE A SHARK THAT CAN BITE ITS PREY IN
HALF, CATFISH HAVE TO SWALLOW IT WHOLE.
SO IF THEY ARE OVERLY
AMBITIOUS, THEY WILL CHOKE.
BUT THIS FISH
HAS A DIFFERENT PROBLEM...
INSIDE ITS MOUTH
IS A PARASITIC BLOODSUCKER.
ANOTHER ONE HERE.
AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ENGORGED,
ABSOLUTELY ENGORGED WITH BLOOD,
THE BLOOD OF THIS POOR CATFISH.
THIS TINY PARASITE, THE
CANDIRU, AND THIS VAST PREDATOR
ARE BOTH FROM THE MAFIA-LIKE
FAMILY OF CATFISH.
THIS IS PRETTY DISGUSTING.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET HOLD OF
IT 'CAUSE THEY'RE VERY SLIPPERY.
NEED MORE FINGERNAILS.
OKAY, THERE WE GO.
SO, THERE WE GO.
BEFORE AND AFTER.
THIS ONE'S FED.
THIS ONE'S
STILL LEAN AND HUNGRY.
AND AS I'LL FIND OUT, IT'S THESE SMALL
GUYS YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR,
AS THIS PARASITE IS ONE OF
THE CRUELEST CATFISH I'LL MEET.
THERE WE GO.
OKAY.
THAT WAS NICE TO CATCH THAT.
NOT THE FISH I WANT, BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A REAL MONSTER IN ITS OWN RIGHT.
THE CANDIRU USUALLY TARGETS A BIG FISH AS
ITS HOST, DRINKING BLOOD FROM ITS GILLS.
BUT OCCASIONALLY,
THEY MAKE MISTAKES.
THIS HAS RESULTED IN ONE
OF THE MOST INFAMOUS LEGENDS
EVER TO EMERGE FROM THE AMAZON...
A MAN URINATING IN THE RIVER
WHO HAS A FISH
SWIM UP HIS PENIS.
YET FOR ONE GENTLEMAN,
THIS URBAN MYTH BECAME REALITY.
LUCKILY, HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT
TO THIS SURGERY IN MANAUS,
WHERE HE WAS TREATED
BY DR. ANOAR SAMAD.
HE'D ACTUALLY HAD THIS FISH
INSIDE HIM FOR FOUR DAYS,
AND THE REASON THERE WAS SUCH A DELAY WAS
BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY LIVED A LONG WAY
IN THE INTERIOR,
AWAY FROM THE CITY.
HE HAD
A VERY, VERY SWOLLEN BLADDER.
HE WAS BLEEDING, GENERAL FEVER, SWOLLEN
TESTICLES, GENERALLY IN A VERY BAD WAY.
THE FISH WASN'T VISIBLE.
IT'S GOT THESE LITTLE SORT OF
SPINES ON THE GILL FLAPS,
SO IT WAS ALMOST, LIKE,
WORKING ITS WAY IN LIKE THAT.
IT WOULD HAVE SWUM AS FAR AS
THE SPHINCTER, AT WHICH POINT,
THE FISH WAS APPARENTLY TRYING
TO SORT OF GNAW ITS WAY OUT.
IT WAS ACTUALLY INSTEAD OF JUST
SWIMMING UP THE URETHRA,
IT WAS ACTUALLY
STARTING TO GNAW.
SO THIS GUY, OBVIOUSLY,
WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN.
WHAT WAS DONE FIRST OF ALL
WAS THAT THE ENDOSCOPE
WAS PUT IN THE END OF HIS PENIS
INTO THE URETHRA.
THE ENDOSCOPE WAS EQUIPPED
WITH A CAMERA,
AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL FOOTAGE
FROM THAT OPERATION.
THEY WERE EXPECTING
TO FIND A LITTLE FISH.
WHAT THEY FOUND INSTEAD
WAS SOMETHING THAT WENT ALMOST
FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE URETHRA
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE SPHINCTER.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING
FIVE OR SIX INCHES.
SO, NOT EXACTLY A LITTLE FISH.
QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL ANIMAL.
CANDIRU LOCATE THEIR HOSTS BY
FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF DILUTE UREA
THAT FISH EXCRETE
FROM THEIR GILLS.
THIS COULD EXPLAIN
THIS CANDIRU'S MISTAKE.
I GO IN SEARCH OF ITS UNFORTUNATE VICTIM
TO RE-INTRODUCE HIM TO THE ACTUAL FISH
THAT SWAM UP HIS URINE STREAM.
HAVING HEARD A HORRIFIC ACCOUNT
OF A FISH ENTERING A MAN'S PENIS,
I MANAGED NOT ONLY TO TRACK DOWN
THE VICTIM, BUT I TAKE HIM BACK
TO THE ACTUAL SCENE OF THE ASSAULT
ON HIS MANHOOD TO RELIVE THE EVENTS
THAT HAVE HAUNTED HIM
SINCE THAT DAY.
OKAY, SO,
IT'S 11 YEARS AGO.
IT'S IN THIS VERY SPOT.
SILVIO AND SOME FRIENDS
WERE IN THE WATER DOWN THERE.
AND AFTER A LITTLE PERIOD OF TIME, SILVIO
FELT THE NEED TO URINATE, AS HAPPENS.
HE KNEW THE STORY
ABOUT THE CANDIRU,
SO HE ACTUALLY TOOK HIMSELF
PARTIALLY OUT OF THE WATER.
WHILE HE WAS RELIEVING HIMSELF, SUDDENLY,
HE SAID, HE JUST HAD A BIT OF A SHOCK.
AND THE FIRST THING HE KNEW WAS THAT THE
FISH WAS ALREADY, YOU KNOW, INSIDE.
ONLY JUST THE END OF ITS TAIL
WAS OUT.
TRIED TO GRAB HOLD OF IT, BUT IT'S A VERY
SMOOTH FISH, A BIT LIKE A BAR OF SOAP.
NO GOOD.
NO SUCCESS PULLING IT OUT.
SO BASICALLY JUST RAN UP ONTO THE
BANK TO TRY AND GET SOME HELP.
I DECIDE TO THROW A NET OUT TO SEE IF
I CAN CATCH ONE OF THESE CRITTERS.
HERE WE GO.
THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY
WHAT SILVIO DESCRIBED.
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
GOING IN ONE DIRECTION
AND JUST NOT WANTING TO
COME INTO REVERSE AT ALL.
LOOK AT THAT.
I CAN ACTUALLY FEEL ITS SPINES
DIGGING IN WHEN IT DOES THAT.
IT WAS ACTUALLY WALKING,
USING ITS HEAD.
NOW, IMAGINE THAT
IN AN ORIFICE.
THIS FISH IS JUST LEAKING BLOOD.
IT'S NOT THIS FISH'S BLOOD.
IT'S SOMETHING
IT'S BEEN FEEDING ON.
AND IT IS JUST AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE, A
REAL SORT OF VAMPIRE FISH, THIS THING.
A FISH LIKE THIS MAY HAVE ENTERED
SILVIO IN SEARCH OF A BLOOD MEAL,
BUT LITTLE DID IT KNOW
THAT ITS MISTAKE
WOULD RESULT IN AN UNPRECEDENTED
MEDICAL PROCEDURE LASTING TWO HOURS.
THE FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO... A BIT
LIKE A HOOK THAT'S GOT A BARB ON IT.
ACTUALLY PULLING IT BACK THE WAY IT
WENT IN IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA.
HE WAS THINKING OF ACTUALLY
SORT OF COMING IN FROM THE SIDE,
COMING IN FROM THE PERINEUM
AND ACTUALLY TRYING TO SORT OF
PULL THE FISH OUT HEADFIRST,
BUT HE THOUGHT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SUCH A
LONG TIME IN THERE, THEY WOULD ACTUALLY...
AND ALSO, THE FISH
WAS STARTING TO ROT A BIT.
MAYBE TRY AND PULL IT OUT
WITH THE ENDOSCOPE.
YOU KNOW, OUT TAILFIRST
THE WAY THAT IT WENT IN.
THE TAIL OF THE FISH WAS ABOUT
HERE, ABOUT AN INCH IN.
AND SO THE HEAD OF IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN SOMEWHERE LIKE HERE.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED
WAS THAT THE PINCERS
WERE GRADUALLY MANIPULATED
OUT OF THE HOLE HERE.
THERE WE GO.
GRABBED HOLD OF THE FISH JUST IN FRONT
OF THE TAIL AND THEN, USING THE CAMERA,
AND THEN THE WHOLE APPARATUS JUST GRADUALLY,
GRADUALLY, VERY DELICATELY MOVED OUT.
APPARENTLY, IT WAS NECESSARY TO PULL
WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORCE,
BUT FEELING THAT IT'S NOT DOING
ANY DAMAGE.
AND FORTUNATELY,
IT DID COME OUT EVENTUALLY.
THE FISH WAS SENT TO THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF AMAZONIAN RESEARCH
TO BE FORMALLY IDENTIFIED, THUS CONFIRMING,
AFTER CENTURIES OF SPECULATION,
THAT A FISH HAS ENTERED A HUMAN
IN THE MOST INTIMATE OF PLACES.
THIS IS A SOMEWHAT MOMENTOUS
AND POSSIBLY DELICATE OCCASION.
I'M BRINGING SILVIO BACK
TO MEET HIS FISH.
THIS ONE.
SILVIO...
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME
SINCE HE HAD THE SURGERY
THAT SILVIO HAS SEEN THIS FISH,
THIS VERY FISH.
I JUST ASKED SILVIO IF HE WOULD
LIKE TO HANDLE IT,
AND A VERY DEFINITE
""NO, I THINK ONCE WAS ENOUGH.""
SO MAYBE IF I LEAVE IT
IN MY HAND.
BUT I'M QUITE STRUCK
BY HOW LARGE IT IS.
NOW, HE'S LOOKING AT IT NOW, THINKING,
""I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS THAT BIG.
I THOUGHT IT WAS SMALLER.""
IT REALLY DOES
SORT OF BEGGAR BELIEF
THAT SOMETHING OF THAT SIZE
COULD BURROW INTO YOU.
SO, IS THE CANDIRU THE WORST
OF ALL THE FISH IN THE AMAZON,
A CATFISH OF SUCH VILE REPUTATION
THAT NONE CAN SURPASS IT?
DR. LUCIA RAPP, THE CURATOR
OF THE COLLECTION HERE,
WANTS TO SHOW ME ANOTHER CATFISH SPECIES
THAT IS POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE HORRIFIC
THAN THE BLOODSUCKING CANDIRU.
SO WHAT WAS THE CASE
THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT?
WE HAD A SITUATION HERE
RECENTLY.
WE RECEIVED A VISIT
OF A DOCTOR.
HE CAME WITH SOME IMAGES
OF TWO CORPSES, TWO MEN.
HE BELIEVED
THAT THEY WERE SHOT
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THOSE
VERY ROUND HOLES ON THE BODY.
HE STARTED TO DISSECT THE CORPSE,
AND HE SAW IT WAS NOT GUNSHOTS.
THE CORPSES WERE HOLLOW ALREADY
INSIDE, WITHOUT ANY ORGANS.
WOW. I'M JUST TRYING TO IMAGINE BEING A
PATHOLOGIST AND YOU'RE BROUGHT A CORPSE.
THERE'S WHAT LOOKS LIKE
BULLET HOLES.
YOU START TO DISSECT THE BODY,
AND THE BODY IS HOLLOW...
THE ORGANS
HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
AND THERE WASN'T
ANY KIND OF BULLET
OR SOMETHING INSIDE THE CORPSES,
JUST THE FISHES.
SO HE REALIZED THAT THE FISHES GOT INSIDE
THE BODIES AND EATEN THE ORGANS INSIDE.
THE FISH WAS IDENTIFIED AS A CLOSE CATFISH
RELATIVE OF THE BLOODSUCKING CANDIRU
CALLED THE CANDIRU-Açú.
WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD
WHEN THE FISH GOT IN?
WELL, THEY SUSPECTED THE MEN
MIGHT BE EATEN ALIVE
BECAUSE HE SAW THE STRUCTURE OF THE FLESH,
AND THEY WERE EATEN FROM THE INSIDE.
AND THEY PROBABLY DIED
FROM THAT.
NOT GONNA BE ALIVE FOR VERY LONG
WITH ALL THAT GOING ON INSIDE YOU.
YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE.
IF YOU ARE ALIVE, IF YOU FEEL THE
FISH, YOU CAN JUST REMOVE IT.
BUT IF YOU ARE, FOR EXAMPLE,
DRUNK OR ILL OR SOMETHING,
YOU MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH
TO RESIST THEM.
IMAGINE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE
FISH ATTACKING YOU AT ONCE.
NOT A VERY PLEASANT THOUGHT IF YOU'RE
GOING FOR A LITTLE SWIM IN THE AMAZON.
HAVING HEARD THIS GRUESOME TALE, I
DECIDE TO VISIT THE CITY MORGUE
TO SEE IF I CAN TRACK DOWN
ANY MORE DETAILS.
I THINK IT'S ALL VERY WELL HAVING
A CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY
ABOUT SOME OF THESE BIZARRE
AND GRUESOME DEATHS.
BUT ACTUALLY SEEING THE PEOPLE
WAITING OUTSIDE HERE
WHO HAVE COME, BASICALLY,
TO IDENTIFY BODIES,
YOU KNOW,
IT BECOMES MUCH MORE PERSONAL,
AND I'M NOT, TO BE HONEST,
TOTALLY PREPARED
FOR WHAT I'M GONNA SORT OF HEAR
OR EVEN SEE IN THERE.
A LITTLE BIT SORT OF UNEASY
AND UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT.
BUT...
YEAH, TIME TO GO, ANYWAY.
I'VE COME TO THE MANAUS MORGUE
TO INVESTIGATE AN INCIDENT
WHERE A HUMAN WAS EATEN
FROM WITHIN BY A CATFISH.
DR. ELIZABETH BEZERRA HAS DEALT
WITH SEVERAL CASES LIKE THIS.
SHE WAS THE FIRST PATHOLOGIST TO
RECOGNIZE THIS BIZARRE BEHAVIOR
AND PRESENT IT
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
APPARENTLY, MONDAYS ARE THE WORST DAYS
FOR BODIES COMING IN IN THIS STATE.
PEOPLE GO OUT, PICNICS,
HAVING A DRINK ON THE WEEKEND.
THEY FALL IN THE WATER,
THEY DISAPPEAR,
AND THEN MONDAYS,
THE BODIES COME TO THE SURFACE.
SO, I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE... WE'RE NOT
JUST TALKING ABOUT ONE OR TWO ANIMALS.
THE MOST THAT DR. ELIZABETH HAS ACTUALLY
TAKEN FROM A CORPSE, OR FOUND INSIDE,
IS MORE THAN 100 OF THESE FISH.
SO, THESE FISH ARE SORT OF PURPOSE-BUILT
FOR THE TASK, IT APPEARS.
CYLINDRICAL BODY,
VERY SMOOTH AND SLIMY,
AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS MOUTH THAT WHEN
IT OPENS, IT PRODUCES A CIRCULAR BITE.
THESE ARE ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHS
FROM THE MORGUE
THAT SHOW
THE GUNSHOT-WOUND-LIKE HOLES.
AND IN SOME CASES, THE FISH
STILL INSIDE THE HUMAN CORPSE.
THE BODY IS LITERALLY EATEN
FROM THE INSIDE.
JUST THE BONES
AND SOME SKIN REMAIN.
SO IT'S REALLY QUITE
A HORRIFYING THING TO VISUALIZE.
UNLIKE THE HARMLESS CATFISH OF THE
U.S., AMAZON CATFISH ARE PROVING TO BE
A DIVERSE GROUP
OF GRUESOME KILLERS.
AND HAVING HEARD THIS GRISLY STORY, I'M
STRANGELY DRAWN TO THIS MACABRE FISH.
I'M KEEN TO SEE A LIVE ONE
IN ACTION.
BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL BE USING
A HUMAN CORPSE AS BAIT.
THE THOUGHT OF MAYBE MORE THAN 100
OF THESE BORING INTO A HUMAN BODY...
I MEAN, THEY REALLY ARE
FLESH-EATING MONSTERS.
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU USE A
BIG FISH TO CATCH A SMALL FISH.
BUT AFTER JUST TWO HOURS,
IT'S DEFINITELY WORKED.
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW THE SCIENTIFIC NAME FOR ALL
THE SCAVENGERS AT THIS GRUESOME PICNIC.
THE LOCALS CALL THESE MUSUN,
OR SNAKEFISH.
THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING
A BIT DIFFERENT IN THERE.
IF I CAN GET IT OUT.
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO
SHOVE MY HAND IN THERE.
THERE, THERE, THERE, THERE.
THERE, THERE, THERE.
JUST HOLD HIM.
THERE WE GO.
SO, THIS IS THE CANDIRU-Açú.
THIS IS THE FISH THAT BORES HOLES IN THE
BODY AND THEN DEVOURS FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
AND IT WAS THIS FISH THAT THEY RETRIEVED
FROM THOSE CORPSES IN THE MORGUE.
THIS WAS A HEAVY FISH
WHEN IT WENT IN.
NOTHING LEFT INSIDE.
IN FACT, IF I JUST RIP IT OPEN A LITTLE
BIT... THE CANDIRU-Açú MAKES NO DISTINCTION
BETWEEN HUMAN FLESH AND THAT OF ANY
OTHER ANIMAL FLOATING IN THE AMAZON.
JUST LIKE A HOLLOW CASE OF SKIN WITH
THE REMNANTS OF THE BONE INSIDE.
THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT THE
AUTOPSY REPORT WAS IN THE MORGUE,
EXCEPT IN THAT CASE, WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT A HUMAN BEING.
THIS WATER IS OBVIOUSLY FILLED
WITH FLESH-EATERS,
SO I TRY AND ENTICE THEM
TO FEED OUT OF MY HAND.
I'M ACTUALLY
JUST ON SOMEBODY'S HOUSE HERE.
AND I'M JUST DANGLING THIS FISH
OFF THE SIDE,
AND THESE CANDIRU ARE JUST
ATTACKING RIGHT ON THE SURFACE.
AND I CAN SEE FROM HERE THE WAY THEY
ARE JUST LITERALLY DRILLING THEIR WAY
INTO THAT FISH.
IT'S LIKE A CROCODILE
DEATH ROLL.
AND NO DOUBT THE CAUSE OF THE
GUNSHOT-LIKE ENTRY HOLES IN THE CORPSES.
I MIGHT TRY AND LIFT THEM OUT,
ACTUALLY.
LOOK AT THAT.
HEY, THERE'S ONE THERE.
BACK IN THE WATER.
APPARENTLY, THESE THINGS WILL GIVE
YOU A BITE JUST LIKE A PIRANHA.
LOOK AT THAT.
THAT'S VERY, VERY DEFINITE CUT.
AND THIS IS ALL THE WORK
OF THE CANDIRU.
THE AMAZON RIVER
IS A SCAVENGER'S PARADISE.
IT'S LIKE AN ACID BATH HERE
FOR CORPSES.
AND AGAIN, IT'S MEMBERS
OF THE CATFISH FAMILY
THAT ARE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL
OPERATORS, CLEANING UP THE BODIES.
BUT AS I CONTINUE MY QUEST, I WITNESS
AN ASTOUNDING ACT OF CANNIBALISM...
GOOD GRIEF!
AND FINALLY TRACK DOWN
MY RIVER MONSTER.
THAT'S A PIRAíBA!
IT'S A PIRAíBA!
I'VE SEEN THAT HERE IN THE AMAZON, SMALL
CATFISH HAVE A FRIGHTENING ABILITY
TO ATTACK US WHERE IT HURTS MOST,
AND ALSO TO DISPOSE OF OUR BODIES.
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE LARGE CATFISH?
I STARTED THIS QUEST
WITH A TALE OF A MAN-EATER.
CAN THEY REALLY SWALLOW
SOMETHING AS BIG AS THEMSELVES?
I NEED TO RESUME MY HUNT FOR THE BIGGEST
CATFISH IN THE AMAZON, THE PIRAíBA.
BUT NO SOONER
HAVE I CAST INTO THE WATER
WHEN MY FISHING GUIDE, FLAVIO,
SPOTS A TRULY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE
OF OVERAMBITIOUS AMAZON PREDATION...
OH, LOUCO!
SOMETHING THAT IMMEDIATELY REMINDS ME
OF THE MAN HALF-SWALLOWED BY A FISH.
WE'VE JUST SEEN THIS PAYARA FLOATING DOWN
THE RIVER, QUITE A BIG ONE... STILL ALIVE.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS DEAD
TO START WITH.
ON INVESTIGATION, IT'S GOT
ANOTHER ONE DOWN ITS THROAT.
AND FLAVIO'S JUST GRABBING HOLD OF
THE TAIL OF IT AND PULLING IT OUT.
HERE WE GO. LOOK AT IT.
IT'S THE TAIL OF ANOTHER FISH.
SO THIS FISH ALMOST CHOKED TO DEATH ON
SOMETHING JUST TOO BIG TO SWALLOW, REALLY.
IF WE CAN GET THE OTHER FISH
OUT, IT MIGHT SURVIVE.
BUT AS IT IS... GOOD GRIEF!
SIZE OF THAT.
LOOK AT THAT!
JUST LOOK AT THAT... GOOD GRIEF!
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE FISH
THAT THAT OTHER FISH SWALLOWED.
SO, THAT'S THE MEAL, THE ONE THAT'S
LOOKING SLIGHTLY WORSE FOR WEAR.
AND THIS IS THE GREEDY ONE THAT
SWALLOWED IT, WHICH MIGHT NOW RECOVER.
THIS REMARKABLE ACT OF
CANNIBALISM IS JUST AS AMBITIOUS
AS THE CATFISH
THAT TRIED TO SWALLOW A MAN.
MAYBE IN THESE MURKY WATERS, ACCIDENTALLY
BITING OFF MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW
IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE.
OH, LOUCO.
REINVIGORATED BY THIS CHANCE ENCOUNTER,
I'M BACK ON MY QUEST IN EARNEST.
OH.
JUST TRYING
A DIFFERENT SPOT HERE.
GOT A RAPID AT THE TOP THERE, AND THEN
THERE'S A DEEP HOLE WITH A CLEAN BOTTOM.
AND THIS IS A PARTICULAR PLACE
FOR PIRAíBA.
I'VE HAD A FEW FISH RECENTLY
THAT HAVE TAKEN THE BAIT,
AND I JUST HAVEN'T HOOKED UP,
OR THEY'VE COME OFF.
COME ON!
OH IT'S COME OFF.
SO I'M TRYING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT
CLEVER... I'M PUTTING A DOUBLE-HOOKED RIG ON
SO THAT THE IDEA IS IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO TAKE THE ENTIRE BAIT.
EVEN IF IT JUST NIPS THE TAIL
OF IT OR THE BODY OF IT,
I SHOULD HOOK UP,
GET A GOOD HOOK HOLD.
OKAY.
OFF THE FRONT OF THE BOAT.
SOMETHING DOWN THERE... JUST GRABBED THE
BAIT... BENT THE ROD... THEN LET GO.
UGH!
THAT IS A FISH ON.
I THINK IT'S COMING TOWARDS ME.
WHAT I DON'T WANT
IS THE HOOK TO COME OUT LIKE...
IT HAS BEEN DOING.
FEELS STRANGE.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HOOK THESE FISH,
AND THEY'RE LITERALLY ON FOR HOURS.
AND IT GETS DARK, AND THEY
GIVE UP AND CUT THE LINE.
I'VE COME FAR TOO FAR TO GIVE UP, SO EVEN
THOUGH MY MUSCLES ARE ACHING, I CARRY ON.
IT HAS A VERY FAST
SORT OF PULSING TO IT.
IT'S NOT
A THROB, THROB, THROB, THROB.
THIS IS A BIG FISH.
I CAN ONLY BULLY
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.
STRONG, STRONG, STRONG FISH.
STRONG FISH.
STRONG FISH.
AFTER A STRUGGLE OF NEARLY HALF
AN HOUR, I HAVE THE BETTER OF IT.
THERE IT IS! THERE'S THE FISH!
THERE'S THE FISH!
THERE'S THE FISH!
PIRAíBA...
IT'S A PIRAíBA!
AH!
HERE WE GO.
THIS IS THE ONE I WANTED.
THIS IS THE PIRAíBA,
THE REAL MONSTER OF THE AMAZON.
THE FISH IS GROWLING AT ME.
OH.
BIG OLD MOUTH ON THERE.
HEAVY, HEAVY FISH.
I CAN HARDLY HOLD THIS UP.
MY ARMS ARE PRETTY SHOT ANYWAY.
I CAN FEEL THE FISH FLEXING.
IT'S ABOUT TO KICK.
WHOA! OOPS.
AND THIS IS THE ONE
THAT PEOPLE SAY,
WHEN IT GETS BIG ENOUGH,
IT GOES AFTER PEOPLE, AS WELL.
LOOKS A BIT LIKE A SHARK, AND
IT HAS A REPUTATION TO MATCH.
THIS IS A BIG ONE,
BUT THEY DO GO BIGGER.
THEY DO GO BIGGER.
THIS ONE, I DON'T KNOW,
POSSIBLY ABOUT 80 POUNDS.
THIS IS A MAN-SIZED FISH.
BUT THEY GO BIGGER
THAN MAN-SIZED.
THEY GO A SIZE BIG ENOUGH
TO SWALLOW A MAN.
AND A STREAMLINED FISH.
SMOOTH SKIN, NO SCALES.
BUT IT'S A VERY STREAMLINED
CATFISH.
MOST CATFISH ARE PRETTY SLOBBY.
THEY MOPE AROUND
ON MUDDY BOTTOMS.
BUT THIS IS A FISH OF FAIRLY FAST CURRENT,
AND I CAN JUST FEEL THAT MUSCLE FLEXING.
THAT'S A LOVELY, LOVELY RESULT.
AND AM I TIRED... AM I TIRED.
WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO, THOUGH, IS REMEMBER
THAT THE FISH IS AS TIRED AS I AM.
SO, ALTHOUGH I WANT TO ADMIRE IT
OUT OF THE WATER,
I'VE GOT TO GET IT BACK AND THINK OF THE...
THINK OF THE FISH'S RECOVERY, AS WELL.
OH.
OH.
OKAY.
OKAY.
OKAY.
OH.
AND HE'S GONE.
WHAT A RIVER MONSTER.
IN MY INVESTIGATION, I'VE SEEN
HOW, IN THESE MURKY WATERS,
CATFISH SOMETIMES
MAKE MISTAKES...
I'VE SEEN HOW CATFISH MAKE NO DISTINCTION
BETWEEN HUMAN AND OTHER FLESH...
AND I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND
HOW IN THE AMAZON,
FISH WILL BITE OFF
MORE THAN THEY CAN CHEW.
SO IF YOU COMBINE THESE FINDINGS AND
IMAGINE THIS PIRAíBA THREE TIMES THE SIZE,
STILL WELL WITHIN
THE MAXIMUM RECORDED WEIGHT,
THEN JUST ASK YOURSELF,
ARE THOSE ACCOUNTS
OF FISH SWALLOWING PEOPLE
JUST FISHERMEN'S TALES?
I CAME HERE IN SEARCH
OF A MAN-EATING FISH.
BUT INSTEAD, I FOUND A MAFIA-LIKE FAMILY
OF KILLERS THAT ARE SURELY THE AMAZON'S
MOST FRIGHTENING
RIVER MONSTERS.","Arapaima gigas, also known simply as Arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche, is a species of arapaima native to the basin of the Amazon River. Once believed to be the sole species in the genus, it is among the largest freshwater fish. The species is an obligate air breather, so it needs to come to the surface regularly to breathe air.


== Taxonomy ==

Arapaima gigas was originally regarded as the only species in the genus Arapaima (monotypic), but the subsequent identification of further species, together with the rarity of specimens and the loss of several type specimens, has led to some uncertainty regarding classification within the genus and the identity of described individuals. Recently, some studies have added extra species to the genus due to common morphological features, including Arapaima leptosoma and Arapaima agassizii. These speciation events may have occurred due to evidence of ""long-distance marine or geodispersal"" from similar morphological traits in both fossilized and living specimen within the genus. Overall, it is unclear if Arapaima gigas truly is the only species in its genus.


== Description ==
The species is among the largest known freshwater fish, commonly measuring 200 cm (79 in) and reportedly exceptionally reaching lengths of up to 450 cm (15 ft). Adults may weigh up to 200 kg (440 lb). Of the total body weight, head weight is typically 10.3% to 12.8%. 
It is an ancient fish, belonging to a group of primitive carnivorous bony-tongued fishes. A. gigas has a streamlined body with dorsal and anal fins set well back towards the tail. While the body is mainly gray to gray-green, its Brazilian local name pirarucu derives from an indigenous word for ""red fish"", thought to refer to either the red flecks on the scales towards the tail, or the reddish-orange color of its meat. Red coloration typically shows up in males after sexual maturation, with up to 70% of the total body plan in males having red coloration.
The fish have ""flexible, armor-like scales"" made up of ""a hard, mineralized outer layer"" and ""a tough-but-flexible inner layer"" that help protect it from attacks by piranhas. The scales, which are typically 5–7cm but can reach 10cm in larger individuals, are built from collagen fibers in a layered structure. On the body, they overlap each other to form the armor-like characteristic.


== Distribution and history ==
A. gigas is native to freshwater in the basin of the Amazon River and Tocantins-Araguaia (Brazil) river basins; it is known to occur in Brazil and Peru.
In Bolivia and Peru known as paiche, it is considered an invasive species in most parts, affecting local native species and the ecosystem. Other small populations have been found in the Iquitos region of Peru, and four distinct rivers in Ecuador, Colombia and Guyana.
Its populations are increasing and becoming more common in its non-native range, yet is rapidly declining in its native range.  It was first found in 1976, introduced into the Madre de Dios region in Peru, for aquaculture. In about a decade, arapaimas were found in Bolivian waters due to the connection of the Madre de Dios basin to the Beni River in Bolivia. Rising water of aquaculture ponds allowed fish to escape into the watershed and establishing populations outside of containment.
Current distribution in Bolivia is characterized by 70 registered distribution points, including small rivers, lagoons, and streams between the Beni and Madre de Dios (Peru) rivers. Historical reports of arapaima sightings started north near the border of Peru, then traveled downstream as populations began to establish and spatially separate. In less than 30 years, the species has invaded the Madre de Dios and Beni watersheds.
The species has been introduced to parts of East Asia, both for fishing purposes and accidentally. The fish are found in flooded forest areas where they reproduce during the wet season; they relocate to lakes after water levels drop. It is also distributed by ornamental aquaculture and commonly pet-traded in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. There are fish farms in Thailand and Malaysia. It is particularly prominent in Java and Sumatra regions in Indonesia. Studies found some single individuals in freshwater or dead in shallow water. One finding recorded a total of 22 individuals in Surabaya, which is the second largest Indonesian city.
A 13-million-year-old fossil of arapaima (or very similar species) has been found in Colombia, in the Villavieja Formation, which dates from the Miocene epoch.


== Physiology ==
Average lifespan in captivity is 15–20 years. There is no sufficient evidence on lifespan in the wild.
A. gigas grows rapidly, reaching about 10kg in its first year, then at moderate growth rates once reaching sexual maturity, around 5 years of age or 1.65m length. Morphology changes occur as an individual  undergoes the transition from water-breather to air-breather 8–9 days after hatch. During the transition to air-breathing, the structure of the gills changes, making them better adapted for ion absorption, but less able to undergo gas diffusion. Once developmental changes in the gills take place, the lamella is less recognizable. The adult gills are made up of smooth, column-shaped filaments. The kidneys have an important role in nitrogenous waste excretion in this species and are enlarged in adult fish.
Phenotypic sex of A. gigas juveniles is not differentiated, meaning the gonad cells can produce both sexes. In females, only the left ovary was developed which differs in size during the reproductive cycle. It increases as maturation occurs, then reduces after spawning. Females have a genital pore on their ventral (under) side that connects the reproductive organs with external environment to allow for mating. In males, only a left testis was developed, which was small and did not differ in size during the reproductive cycle. Both reproductive organs are unpaired and situated near the swim bladder. In some cases, right gonads were found but atrophic.
Both males and females have a gland-like secretory organ on the head,  mostly used for communication with offspring and is therefore more prominent in males—who provide the majority of parental care. The secretion is made of 400 substances and consist of hormones, proteins, peptides and likely pheromones which also provides nutrients for fry (freshly hatched fish).


== Ecology ==


=== Breathing ===
A. gigas requires breathing surface air to supplement the oxygen it derives from the use of its gills, and as such, is dependent on surfacing every 5–15 minutes to loudly gulp air at the surface. As in other species in the genus, a modified swim bladder that contains lung-like tissue is used for this purpose.


=== Feeding ===
The species are specialized carnivores, feeding primarily on fish. Invertebrates are also part of their diet. Juveniles prefer insects and fish larvae until fully grown. Seasonal growth is observed due food selectivity and strong seasonal changes in food availability. They also consume birds, mammals, fruits, and seeds on the water surface. Prey fish families include Callichthyidae, Loricariidae, Pimelodidae, and Heptapteridae.


=== Migration ===
The species undergoes seasonal lateral migration between river channels and floodplains driven by low depth and low current velocity. The lake and forest habitats seem to be preferred. When water levels are high, A. gigas fish migrated to flooded forests with increasingly rising levels. When water levels decline, fish begin to migrate towards lower levels of flooded forests, then to lakes where they stay when it is physically isolated due to low water levels. Migration to the flooded forest is a mechanism for feeding and parental care, with prey (for both adults and offspring) having increased densities in this habitat at the high-water season. During high water levels, A. gigas populations have high densities in lakes, due to increased survival rates (physical safety), feeding (adequate feeding rates), and promoting reproduction (courtship and mating activities).


=== Spawning ===
Sexual maturity is reached at 5 years, and female fecundity increases with each year. Spawning occurs in lakes and river channels during the time of low water levels (August to March) in small, separate clutches with an average of less than 500 eggs in each batch. Parents have been observed using their mouths to dig holes in the substrate to create a nest for eggs. Small, batched spawning strategy is thought to derive from the unpredictability of the environment, as it lowers the total loss of fertilized eggs due to natural events. In the event of reproductive failures, pairs may breed again for better success. Males remain to protect the offspring for three to six months. Body mass and muscle yield does not differ during sexual maturation cycles, unlike many other fish species. Red pigment among males is thought to be used for sexual selection as it is a proxy for age.


== Conservation ==
A. gigas' genetic diversity has been greatly impacted due to habitat loss, environmental degradation, and commercial overexploitation in native fish stocks, as extreme as causing bottlenecks in some populations. In its native ecosystems, it helps to cycle nutrients and energy. Loss of migration paths from anthropogenic actions separates local populations and forms refuges that can persevere, but without the exchange of genes. The species has in the past been heavily impacted by overfishing, exacerbated by their need to surface for breathing every 5 to 15 minutes, causing them to be easy to harpoon. It is classified under the IUCN as ""Data Deficient"" due to a lack of detailed information about population developments. In addition, Arapaima gigas is listed in the CITES Appendix II since 1975, forcing legal harvest to be monitored under intergovernmental control with a management plan. Furthermore, in 2004, it was published in the Brazilian List of Overexploited or Threatened with Over Exploitation Aquatic Invertebrates and Fishes. There are reports that local populations have become extinct in certain areas of Brazil and Peru.
Aquaculture has further threatened diversity through transportation of specimens over hundreds of kilometers. This can cause homogenized genes and, in some cases, wipe out locally adapted populations. A study of ""Genetic Diversity of Arapaima gigas in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin estimated by ISSR marker"" by Vitorino, et al. found that low heterozygosity existed in populations that underwent bottleneck scenarios, which is assumed to be from inbreeding and low reproductive success. Low heterozygosity can detriment future evolutionary potential of species. The study suggests ""periodic monitoring to check eventual reducing levels of population genetic variability and the establishment of management plan."" So far, no technology exists to manipulate the reproduction of the species.
Arapaima fishing was banned outright in Brazil from 1996 to 1999, due to declining populations; since then, both subsistence and commercial fishing have been permitted in specially designated areas, and a sophisticated sustainable management strategy has led to massive recovery of stocks, from 2,500 in 1999 to over 170,000 in 2017. However, there are still large markets of illegal arapaima fishing in the lower Amazon, with about 77% of its harvest coming from unlawful practices. Furthermore, local community-based initiatives have been established to protect waterways for natural reproduction and reestablishment of populations.


== Invasion ==
Arapaima gigas follows what is coined as the ""Biodiversity Conservation Paradox"", where a species has become endangered in its native habitat yet becoming growingly invasive in nonnative home ranges. Previously discussed in the ""Distribution"" section of this page, aquaculture for both fish meat and ornamental markets has caused the spread of the fish where it has become invasive and threaten the integrity of ecosystems. In some parts of Brazil, juvenile individuals are captured and bred in captivity, then dispersed and exported by traders for aquaculture profit.


=== South America ===
For Bolivia, the Arapaima as an invasive species is considered a threat to local native species according to reports. Various reports show a correlation between the spreading of Arapaima and the decline in numbers of native fish species in parts of the Bolivian Amazon. Effects on local fish species populations and on fishing behaviors vary strongly by region. A joint study of the Bolivian government and different research organizations from 2017 points out the necessity to further evaluate the complex environmental and socioeconomic impact of Arapaima in the country.
Oftentimes, introduction comes from accidentally escaped aquaculture groups, or for purposeful control of undesirable prey in parts of Brazil and south-eastern Peru. As discussed in the ""Distribution"" section, once established in the Madre de Dios region in Peru, populations moved to Bolivian waters through connections through the Beni River watershed. The Beni River has few natural barriers, theoretically allowing the arapaima populations to continue evading further south and terrorizing native fishes in Bolivia and even western Brazil.


=== Indonesia ===
As an invasive species in Indonesia, there are subsequent consequences that can be followed in the future, as populations are not yet established enough to significantly affect native species. However, it can be assumed that risks would be similar to events observed in Bolivia and Brazil such as decrease in native populations and fishing stock. Some fishermen even say that these large bony-tongued fish damage their nets, therefore causing socio-economic losses. One study specifically focused on A. gigas in Indonesia found no fry or juveniles in the wild, but one female was found with eggs. This, with the finding of climate matching, causes the inability to rule out successful reproduction and establishment in the region. For now, it is suggested to understand the reproduction and ecology in introduced arapaimas in Indonesia in order to properly propose management strategies and fishing/trading sanctions.


== Cultural importance ==
Arapaima gigas are exploited for fish meat markets and ornamental fishing which can include production, as it has been noted that the characteristic armored scales are commonly used as nail files in areas around the Amazon basin. Fishing and aquaculture provides many jobs in the region, in addition to the fish being an important traditional food for local communities.

THE SAME TERROR AS THE SHARK.
YOU'RE IN THE MONSTER'S MOUTH
GETTING THROWN AROUND.
SOMEBODY'S LIKE A RAG DOLL IN ITS
MOUTH GETTING THROWN ALL OVER.
WE'VE GOT SHARKS IN AUSTRALIA
THAT HIT HARD.
THEY DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING.
BUT AT LEAST THESE KILLERS
ARE CONFINED TO THE OCEANS.
OR ARE THEY?
IT SEEMS ONE SPECIES OF SHARK
HAS BEEN TRESPASSING
FROM SALTWATER INTO
MY TERRITORY... FRESHWATER...
OPERATING WHERE PEOPLE
THOUGHT NO DANGER EXISTED.
ALAN!
AS AN ANGLER AND BIOLOGIST, MY AIM
IS TO WORK OUT HOW THIS IS POSSIBLE
AND JUST HOW FAR INLAND THESE SHARKS
WILL BRING THEIR REIGN OF TERROR.
MY MISSION IS TO FIND OUT WHETHER
IT'S SAFE TO GET BACK IN THE WATER,
EVEN IF YOU'RE MILES
FROM THE SEA.
I'M A SPECIALIST IN HUNTING
DOWN GIANT FRESHWATER ANIMALS.
USING A COMBINATION OF LOGIC, LOCAL
INTELLIGENCE, AND INTUITION,
I FACE SHOALS OF PIRANHA IN SOUTH
AMERICA AND MAN-EATING CATFISH IN ASIA.
SHARKS, THOUGH, ARE
A DIFFERENT TARGET ALTOGETHER.
THESE CREATURES
ARE THE STUFF OF LEGEND.
""JAWS,"" THE ICONIC '70s STORY,
DESCRIBES FEROCIOUS MAN-EATERS
WITH A TASTE FOR HUMAN FLESH.
BUT THE REPORT OF A SHARK OPERATING IN
AN INLAND LAKE IS TRULY TERRIFYING.
TO INVESTIGATE,
I'M HEADING TO AUSTRALIA.
MIDSUMMER ON A BRACKISH LAKE.
THE TEMPERATURE...
OVER 80 DEGREES.
A 23-YEAR-OLD POST-DOCTORATE STUDENT,
BEAU MARTIN, AND HIS FRIEND DAVID
ARE PLANNING A COOLING SWIM
IN MIAMI LAKE.
I'M GONNA FLOG YOU.
I'M GONNA ABSOLUTELY SLAY YOU
IN THIS PLACE.
PUT SOME MONEY
WHERE IT IS.
50 BUCKS?
50 BUCKS, DONE.
YEAH, YOU NEED IT.
YOU NEED THAT FOR THE RACE.
YEAH.
GOING DOWN.
GONNA BEAT YOU.
WHOA.
HEY, KEYS, KEYS, KEYS.
NEED KEYS.
LET'S GO.
SHIRTS OFF... LESS DRAG.
WE'RE GOING. WE'RE GOING.
THEY BEGIN A SWIMMING RACE
ACROSS THE 500-YARD-WIDE LAKE.
DAVE TAKES THE LEAD...
AND REACHES THE SAFETY
OF THE SHORE.
BEAU, HOWEVER,
IS STILL OUT ON THE LAKE.
IN TRYING TO CATCH UP,
HE STRAYS INTO DEEPER WATER.
AAH!
IN AN INSTANT,
HE DISAPPEARS.
DAVE RETURNS TO THE WATER, BUT
THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIS FRIEND.
BEAU'S SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE HAD ALL
THE HALLMARKS OF A SHARK ATTACK.
BUT FEW COULD IMAGINE
THIS APPARENTLY SAFE BACKWATER
TO BE A HUNTING GROUND
FOR SHARKS.
EVEN HERE, WHERE THERE ARE
THE DEADLIEST SNAKES,
MASSIVE CROCS, THE MOST POISONOUS
SPIDERS, THIS INCIDENT RANG ALARM BELLS.
WE JUST DON'T EXPECT TO BE
ATTACKED BY A SHARK
ON AN INLAND LAKE IN AN URBANIZED
AREA LIKE THE GOLD COAST.
IN AUSTRALIA, THERE ARE
THREE SPECIES OF SHARK
COMMONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTACKS ON
PEOPLE... THE GREAT WHITE, THE TIGER SHARK,
AND THE BULL SHARK.
AUSTRALIANS KNOW VIC HISLOP
AS THE SHARK MAN.
LIKE QUINT FROM ""JAWS,""
HISLOP HAS FOUGHT A SERIES
OF BATTLES WITH SHARKS,
INCLUDING
THIS 2 1/2-TON GREAT WHITE.
WE'VE GOT SHARKS IN AUSTRALIA
THAT HIT AND HIT HARD.
THEY DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING.
THEY'RE SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO, THEY PULL
SOMEBODY UNDER, YOU DON'T SEE ANY MORE.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO BE LOOKING AT
THAT EXACT SPOT TO SEE IT HAPPEN.
THE GREAT WHITE IS A NOTORIOUS MAN-EATER,
BUT SOME EXPERTS THINK THE BULL SHARK
IS A FAR MORE DEADLY
THREAT ALTOGETHER.
IT'S A VERY ROBUST ANIMAL,
VERY ROUGH AND TOUGH.
BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE
OF ITS TEETH,
IT CAN'T JUST BITE
THROUGH A BIG CHUNK OF MEAT.
IT HAS TO BITE AND START SHAKING
LIKE CRAZY.
AND, OF COURSE, SOMEBODY'S LIKE A RAG DOLL
IN ITS MOUTH GETTING THROWN ALL OVER,
AND THAT IMMEDIATELY ALSO INSTIGATES
ALL SORTS OF FEAR REACTIONS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN THE MONSTER'S
MOUTH GETTING THROWN AROUND.
STOCKY IN SHAPE,
SAVAGE IN CHARACTER,
THE BULL SHARK IS BUILT LIKE A STREET
FIGHTER, WITH A LEVEL OF RAGING AGGRESSION
THAT GIVES IT ITS NAME.
POUND FOR POUND, IT'S TOP
OF THE LEAGUE OF MAN-EATERS.
STATISTICALLY,
A BULL SHARK'S ATTACK
IS MORE LIKELY TO RESULT
IN DEATH THAN A GREAT WHITE'S.
AND THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE
THAT IT'S A BULL SHARK
THAT KILLED BEAU MARTIN
IN THIS CANAL SYSTEM.
THIS COMPLEX OF WATERWAYS WAS
BUILT DURING THE '70s AND '80s
AND IS BIGGER THAN VENICE, ITALY... 160
MILES OF CANALS AND OVER 30 LAKES.
THIS IS AN AREA WITH
JUST THOUSANDS OF APARTMENTS,
HOUSES RIGHT DOWN
ON THE WATERFRONT.
AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE
JUST THINK OF THESE CANALS
AS A PERFECTLY SAFE PLACE
TO SWIM.
WHAT PUZZLES ME IS HOW ANY SHARK
COULD HAVE MADE ITS WAY HERE,
SO FAR FROM WHERE WE EXPECT TO FIND IT...
THE OPEN OCEAN.
TO WORK THAT OUT, I'M HEADING
60 MILES SOUTH TO THE COAST.
THERE WERE 15 SHARK ATTACKS
IN AUSTRALIA IN 2008,
BUT THERE'S ONE, WELL-REPORTED IN THE
PRESS, THAT IS CENTRAL TO MY INVESTIGATION.
16-YEAR-OLD BROCK CURTIS-MATHEW IS SETTING
OFF WITH HIS FRIEND PETER EDMONDS
FOR SOME
EARLY-MORNING BODYBOARDING.
WE GOT THERE MAYBE
A QUARTER TO 8:00, 8:00-ISH.
THEY'VE CHOSEN A LOCATION NEXT TO
THE MOUTH OF THE RICHMOND RIVER.
THIS IS A POPULAR SURFING SPOT,
OFTEN USED BY THESE CLOSE FRIENDS.
BUT THIS MORNING, AFTER SEVERAL
DAYS OF HEAVY RAIN,
THEY HAVE THE BEACH
TO THEMSELVES.
WE WERE MAYBE LIKE HALFWAY TO WHERE
WE WERE GONNA GO IN THE WATER.
I TURNED AROUND AND CAME
BACK IN, AND HE KEPT GOING.
WHILE BROCK COVERS THEIR POSSESSIONS
IN CASE OF MORE RAIN, PETER HEADS OUT.
HE'S AROUND 35 YARDS
FROM THE SURF LINE.
BUT AS BROCK GOES TO REJOIN HIS
FRIEND, HE GLIMPSES A DARK SHAPE.
I SAW THIS BIG, ROUND,
WEIRD, CIRCLE THING.
WHAT BROCK HAD SEEN
WAS A SHARK.
HE HAS NO IDEA IT IS
ATTACKING HIS FRIEND.
ALL HE CAN SEE FROM 25 YARDS
AWAY IS SOME SPLASHING.
I WAS JUST THINKING,
""OH, WHAT'S HE DOING?
SOMETHING'S...
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.""
BROCK APPROACHES
AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN.
WHEN I GOT UP, LIKE, REALLY
CLOSE, I COULDN'T SEE ANY BLOOD.
AND THEN, LIKE, ONCE I GRABBED HIM
AND STUFF, I NOTICED HIS LEG.
RISKING HIS OWN LIFE, BROCK CARRIES HIS
NOW UNCONSCIOUS FRIEND TOWARD SHORE.
HE HAD TAKEN
A FIRST-AID COURSE AT SCHOOL.
THERE WAS A SLIGHT PULSE WHEN I FIRST
CHECKED IT, LIKE A BEAT... BEAT... BEAT.
COME ON, PETE!
IN A STATE OF SHOCK, HE CALLS
THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.
Emergency service.
PLEASE,
HE'S GONNA DIE.
I JUST SAID, ""CAN YOU
COME DOWN HERE QUICKLY?""
MY FRIEND'S BEEN ATTACKED
BY A SHARK.""
FROM THE SHAPE AND THE SIZE
OF THE WOUND TO PETER'S THIGH,
THE ATTACKER APPEARS
TO BE A BULL SHARK...
SOME 9 FEET LONG.
AFTER THE ATTACK, LIFEGUARD STEPHEN LEAHY
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ON THE SCENE.
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS
HIGH-IMPACT, IT WAS HARD-HITTING,
AND THERE WAS JUST A LARGE AMOUNT OF
FLESH REMOVED FROM HIS UPPER THIGH.
LEAHY HAS WORKED TO SAVE LIVES ON
THESE BEACHES FOR OVER 15 YEARS.
BUT IN THIS CASE, TRAGICALLY,
PETER HAD LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.
THERE WAS
JUST ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO
THAT WOULD SAVE THIS BOY'S LIFE.
DR. VIC PEDDEMORS IS THE FIRST
PERSON MEDICAL TEAMS TURN TO
WHEN THEY BELIEVE
THERE'S BEEN A SHARK ATTACK.
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT A SHARK BITE APPLIES
A FORCE OF OVER 4 TONS PER SQUARE INCH.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR A
SHARK IS TO GET THAT LOWER JAW IN
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE HOOKING
TEETH THAT SORT OF LATCHES IN.
SO, ONCE IT'S GOT ITS LOWER JAW
IN, THE UPPER JAW CAN CLAMP DOWN.
IF THAT LOWER JAW HAS GOT IN
PROPERLY, IT ONLY NEEDS ONE BITE,
AND IT'LL TAKE THE MUSCLE
STRAIGHT OFF.
BECAUSE OF THE SITE
OF THIS INCIDENT,
THE LIFEGUARD ALREADY HAD THIS
ATTACKER'S IDENTITY IN MIND.
KNOWING THAT THE ATTACK'S
HAPPENED JUST HERE,
WE ALWAYS HAD,
IN THE BACK OF OUR MIND,
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE
A BULL SHARK INCIDENT.
IT'S LIKELY THAT THE SHARK HAD CONFUSED
PETER FOR ITS COMMON PREY, A LARGE FISH,
PERHAPS EVEN ANOTHER SHARK.
NOTHING CAN EVER COMPENSATE A FAMILY
OR FRIENDS FOR SUCH A CRUEL LOSS.
BUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE
SALVAGED FROM THIS TERRIBLE EPISODE,
IT MIGHT BE IN IDENTIFYING THE WARNING
SIGNALS THAT ACCOMPANY A BULL SHARK ATTACK.
BULL SHARKS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED CONGREGATING
AROUND RIVER MOUTHS AFTER HEAVY RAIN,
ATTRACTED BY THE SUPPLY OF FRESHWATER
FISH BEING WASHED OUT TO SEA.
WE KNOW THAT BULL SHARKS WILL
ALWAYS HANG AROUND THE RIVER MOUTH
AFTER PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN AND
WHEN THERE ARE LOTS OF FISH AROUND.
THE BEACH WHERE THE ATTACK
OCCURRED IS ONLY 60 METERS AWAY
FROM THE ENTRANCE
OF THAT RIVER MOUTH.
THE BULL SHARK THAT KILLED PETER EDMONDS
HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO THIS SHORELINE
BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY
TO FRESHWATER.
WE'RE WELL AND TRULY AWARE THAT THERE'S
JUST SO MUCH FOR THE BULL SHARK TO LIVE ON
IN OUR FRESHWATER SYSTEMS, AND THAT'S PART
OF THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BULL SHARK...
CAN EASILY COPE IN SALTWATER
AND IN OUR OCEANS,
BUT IT'S JUST AS COMFORTABLE
IN OUR RIVER SYSTEMS.
PERHAPS THIS KNOWLEDGE MIGHT
PREVENT OTHERS BEING CAUGHT,
LIKE PETER, IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.
AS A BIOLOGIST, I WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PARTICULAR AFFINITY
BULL SHARKS HAVE
FOR FRESHWATER.
I NEED TO CATCH ONE.
I MUST HAVE FISHED LITERALLY THOUSANDS
OF DESTINATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD,
BUT THIS TIME,
I THINK I'M OUT OF MY DEPTH.
I'VE NEVER TRIED TO CATCH ANY KIND
OF SHARK, LET ALONE A BULL SHARK.
100 MILES NORTH OF WHERE PETER
WAS KILLED, IN SIGHT OF LAND,
I JOIN A FISHING CHARTER BOAT
OUT AFTER SHARKS.
WITH FOUR RODS SET, I KNOW
I'M IN WITH A GOOD CHANCE.
OH, YEAH.
RIGHT. THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.
THAT IS A BULL SHARK.
HAMMERED QUITE BIG MULLETS, COUPLE-OF-POUND
MULLETS, AND JUST TOOK OFF.
I THINK WE'RE READY TO BRING IT IN
THE BACK OF THE BOAT, ACTUALLY.
OKAY.
THIS ONE'S
NONE TOO HAPPY TO SEE ME.
BUT AFTER THE HOOK'S OUT,
IT BECOMES EASIER TO HANDLE.
IT'S 4 1/2 FEET LONG, AROUND 1/3
OF THE LENGTH THEY CAN REACH.
BOAT'S ROLLING AROUND
A LITTLE BIT AT THE MOMENT,
SIDE ON TO THE TIDE
AND ROLLING A LITTLE BIT.
SO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS MOUTHFUL
OF TEETH, GOT TO BE A WEE BIT CAREFUL.
THE TEETH ARE PARTIALLY
OBSCURED BY THICK GUMS,
BUT THE TIPS ARE
AS SHARP AS SCALPELS.
THAT'S GOOD TO ACTUALLY SEE
ONE OF THESE ANIMALS CLOSE UP,
GET MY HANDS ON ONE...
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED.
BUT WHAT SETS THIS SPECIES OF SHARK
APART IS ITS EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY
TO OPERATE IN BOTH SALTY
AND FRESH WATER.
THE BULL SHARK IS THE ONLY SPECIES
OF SHARK THAT CAN DO THIS.
SOME SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT THE BULL
SHARK IS CAPITALIZING ON THIS ADAPTATION
TO DOMINATE
NEW FEEDING GROUNDS INLAND.
THE BULL SHARK IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT'S
ACTUALLY MUCH MORE CAPABLE THAN OTHER SHARKS
IN REGULATING THE AMOUNT OF SALTS
AND UREA IN ITS BODY TISSUES.
BULL SHARKS CONSTANTLY TEST
THE SALT CONTENT OF THE WATER
WITH TINY SENSORS MOUNTED
ALL OVER THE BODY,
SIMILAR TO THE WAY
WE USE OUR TASTE BUDS.
THEN, A SPECIAL ORGAN, THE RECTAL
GLAND, ACTS LIKE AN ON/OFF VALVE,
RELEASING OR RETAINING SALT
AS REQUIRED.
IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE HOW
CAPABLE THEY ARE AT DOING THAT.
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY,
ENERGETICALLY, VERY COSTLY,
AND THAT'S WHY WE TEND TO FIND THE BIGGER
ANIMALS CAPABLE OF CHANGING VERY QUICKLY,
WHEREAS THE SMALLER ANIMALS
TEND TO STAY WITHIN A RELATIVELY
NARROW BAND OF SALINITY.
THIS AMAZING ADAPTATION
GIVES THE BULL SHARK
A DEADLY ACCESS-ALL-AREAS FREEDOM
TO ROAM, BRINGING ITS VIOLENCE
TO OUR ONCE-PEACEFUL INLAND WATERS...
A PREDATOR THAT CAN OPERATE
IN RIVERS AND ADJOINING LAKES
ALL AROUND THE WORLD,
RESPONSIBLE FOR FATAL ATTACKS
FROM AUSTRALIA TO SOUTH AFRICA,
FROM FLORIDA TO NEW JERSEY.
HERE, IN 1916, FOUR PEOPLE WERE
KILLED AND ONE WAS SEVERELY MUTILATED
IN A 10-DAY SPREE OF ATTACKS.
THIS PROVIDED THE INSPIRATION FOR THE
MOST FAMOUS SHARK STORY OF ALL, ""JAWS.""
BUT WHAT IS SO TERRIFYING
IS THAT TWO OF THESE DEATHS
OCCURRED 15 MILES UP AN ESTUARY...
AT MATAWAN CREEK...
IN A PLACE THAT EVERYONE
THOUGHT WAS SAFE.
MAN-EATERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOUND IN UNTAMED
PLACES, BUT THIS UNSTOPPABLE PREDATOR
SEEMS TO BE BRINGING ITS SAVAGERY INTO
THE VERY HEART OF OUR CIVILIZED WORLD.
AAH!
IS THERE NOTHING IN PLACE TO
STOP THESE DEADLY PREDATORS?
I'M HERE TO MEET TONY HAM.
G'DAY, JEREMY.
HOW YOU GOING?
HE MANAGES THE SHARK CONTROL PROGRAM
ON THE GOLD COAST IN AUSTRALIA.
GOT THE BAIT ON BOARD.
WE'RE PLANNING TO MAKE AN INSPECTION OF
THE SHARK NETS JUST OFF THE MAIN BEACH.
THIS SECTION OF THE BEACH IS CALLED MAIN
BEACH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPIT.
THAT'S A FAIRLY HEAVILY
POPULATED BEACH.
IN SUMMER, YOU'D HAVE ANYWHERE
UPWARD OF 50,000, 60,000 PEOPLE
BETWEEN HERE AND SURFERS PARADISE,
AND THEN, FROM SURFERS DOWN FURTHER,
PROBABLY DOUBLE
THAT NUMBER.
IT'S A BIG BEACH JUST RUNNING
UP WITH SORT OF ALL THE HOTELS
AND SOME OF THE TOURIST
AMENITIES BEHIND THAT.
EXACTLY, BUT BRANCHING OFF HERE ARE A
NUMBER OF CANAL ESTATES AND LARGE LAKES.
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IT'S BASICALLY
EXTENDED THE RIVER HABITAT.
AND SO WE HAVE BULL SHARKS HERE
PRETTY CONSTANTLY.
RIGHT UP INLAND?
YEAH, SO BULL SHARKS WILL
ACTUALLY LIVE ALL THE WAY UP
AND INCLUDING INTO FRESHWATER
REACHES OF SOME RIVERS.
SO THEY'RE DEFINITELY
IN THERE,
AND WHEN YOU GET IN THE WATER,
IF YOU GET IN THE WATER,
YOU COULD ONLY BE JUST A MATTER OF
YARDS AWAY FROM ONE, I SUPPOSE.
LITERALLY, FEET, AND YOU
WOULDN'T KNOW THEY WERE THERE
UNLESS, YOU KNOW, YOU ACTUALLY
SEE IT OR IT BUMPS INTO YOU
OR ACTUALLY DOES HAVE
A BITE AT YOU.
AROUND THE SPIT, AT ABOUT 500 YARDS OFF
THE BEACH, THE SWELL HAS PICKED UP.
THIS SHARK NET IS PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY LINE OF DEFENSE
ALONG A 2 1/2-MILE-LONG BEACH.
THE IDEA IS TO REMOVE SHARKS
THAT COME IN CLOSE TO THE SHORE.
BUT LOOKING AT IT, I CAN SEE
NO REASON WHY BULL SHARKS
WOULDN'T EASILY GO UNDER IT
OR AROUND IT
AND THEN HEAD ON, RELENTLESSLY,
INTO THE CANALS.
AFTER ALL, THE NET IS ONLY 200
YARDS LONG AND JUST 20 FEET HIGH.
SOME THINK THAT THESE MEASURES ARE, IN
FACT, LITERALLY WORSE THAN USELESS.
SHARK NETS IN AUSTRALIA ARE A FALSE
SENSE OF SECURITY FOR TOURISM.
THEY KILL EVERYTHING WE LOVE
OUT THERE.
THEY KILL DOLPHINS,
TURTLES, DUGONG.
BUT MORE IMPORTANT, THE BIG SHARKS
HAVE LEARNED TO FEED OFF THOSE NETS.
THEY'RE NOW A FEEDING GROUND.
COST MILLIONS
OF TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS
FOR A WASTE OF TIME,
JUST A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY.
IT'S A JOKE.
IF HISLOP IS CORRECT, BULL SHARKS
ARE BEING LURED TOWARDS THE SHORE
AND THEN INLAND
INTO THE CANALS AND LAKES.
AND BECAUSE, INEVITABLY, THEY'LL
MEET MORE PEOPLE INLAND,
THIS SPECIES HAS TO BE
A FAR GREATER THREAT
THAN OTHER MAN-EATING SHARKS
WHICH REMAIN OUT AT SEA.
ON MIAMI LAKE, THE DAY AFTER
BEAU MARTIN'S DISAPPEARANCE,
THE SEARCH BEGINS,
LED BY BEAU'S FATHER.
EXHAUSTIVELY, HE COMBS
THE PERIMETER OF THE LAKE.
FOR TWO DAYS,
THERE IS NO SIGN OF BEAU.
ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY, AFTER
THE POLICE HAVE GIVEN UP THE HUNT,
HE BEGINS TO SEARCH
FROM HIS KAYAK.
HE HAPPENS UPON THE BODY OF HIS SON,
PART IN AND PART OUT OF THE WATER.
THE ONLY REASON HIS BODY HAD SURFACED...
THE GASES RESULTING FROM DECOMPOSITION,
CAUSING HIS BODY TO INFLATE.
THE AUTOPSY REVEALED THAT BEAU HAD BEEN
STRUCK THREE TIMES... BY A BULL SHARK...
ONE DEVASTATING BITE ON HIS
LEFT THIGH PROVING FATAL.
THIS PREDATOR HAD SLIPPED
WITH EASE
FROM THE SEA INTO THE BRACKISH
WATER OF MIAMI LAKE.
ONCE INSIDE, IT HAD BEEN FREE
TO GO ABOUT ITS BUSINESS UNSEEN
UNTIL THE KILLING OF BEAU MARTIN
REVEALED ITS DEADLY PRESENCE.
BUT JUST HOW MUCH FURTHER
INLAND INTO FRESHWATER
ARE THESE PREDATORS
CAPABLE OF GOING?
80 MILES INLAND FROM THE OCEAN,
TRAINER ALAN TREADWELL IS TAKING
HIS FINEST TROTTING HORSE, GLEN-BURNS
ARM, FOR EXERCISE IN THE RIVER.
I'D SWUM THERE FOR EIGHT,
NINE YEARS, NEVER A PROBLEM.
IT'S A VERY POPULAR PICNIC SPOT.
THIS PART OF THE RIVER
IS A SECLUDED OASIS,
POPULAR WITH FAMILIES
AS A SWIMMING HOLE.
BUT ON THIS DAY, TREADWELL HAS THE RIVER
TO HIMSELF FOR HIS TRAINING PROGRAM.
HE WANTS TO BUILD UP HIS HORSE'S MUSCLE
STRENGTH WITHOUT STRAINING ITS LEGS.
GLEN-BURNS ARM, A 6-YEAR-OLD
GELDING WEIGHING 1,000 POUNDS,
HAS WON 7 TIMES
OVER A 3-YEAR CAREER.
WITH THE HELP OF HIS
STABLE HAND, ALICE HOLDEN,
TREADWELL TIES A HALF-INCH ROPE
TO THE HORSE'S HALTER.
WITH IT, HE CAN CONTROL
THE HORSE FROM THE BRIDGE.
AS FAR AS TREADWELL CAN SEE
FROM 20 FEET UP ON THE BRIDGE,
EVERYTHING APPEARS
TO BE GOING TO PLAN.
THE HORSE WAS SWIMMING.
I HAD CONTROL OF THE HORSE.
BUT SUDDENLY
SOMETHING STARTLES IT.
THE HORSE LOOKS
LIKE IT'S GONNA DROWN.
THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SAW SOMETHING
HANGING OFF THE BACK OF HIM.
ALAN!
AS THE HORSE ROLLED OVER,
THE COLOR LIGHTENED,
AND IT WENT TO A WHITE
UNDERNEATH, WHATEVER IT WAS.
WHATEVER THIS CREATURE IS, IT
HAS THE FORCE TO HOLD ON TO
AND THE POWER TO SUBMERGE
A 1,000-POUND HORSE.
THE HORSE IS IN TROUBLE.
WE HAD A PROBLEM.
I'VE GOT TO GET THIS HORSE
OUT OF THERE.
WHATEVER'S WRONG, IF I CAN GET HIM
OUT OF THE WATER, I CAN CONTROL IT.
HE WON'T DROWN.
IF WE HADN'T HAVE GOTTEN HIM OUT, I
DON'T BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE SURVIVED.
TRAINER ALAN TREADWELL WAS ABLE
TO PULL HIS HORSE TO SAFETY.
IF THE VICTIM HAD BEEN A HUMAN,
1/5 OF THE SIZE OF HIS HORSE,
THERE WOULD BE NO HOPE
OF SURVIVING THE ATTACK.
THE HORSE, GLEN-BURNS ARM, WAS
TREATED BY A VETERINARY SURGEON...
WHO PHOTOGRAPHED THE WOUND.
I WANT TO MEET UP
WITH ALAN TREADWELL
TO FIND OUT IF THIS ATTACK CAN
BE ATTRIBUTED TO A BULL SHARK.
HELLO, ALAN.
G'DAY. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M WELL, THANKS.
THIS IS THE BOY, IS HE?
YEAH, THIS IS HIM.
CAN I SAY HELLO?
SAY HELLO.
HEY.
SO HE'S NOT JUST
AN ORDINARY HORSE, IS HE?
HE'S A BIT OF AN ATHLETE. BIT OF AN
ATHLETE... YEAH, HE HAS BEEN. OR USED TO BE.
YEAH.
YEAH.
CAN WE SEE THE WOUND
AT ALL?
CAN YOU SHOW ME
WHERE IT WAS?
YEAH, I CAN DO.
IT'S HEALED PRETTY WELL.
YEAH.
THAT'S WHERE IT WAS,
ON THE FLAT THERE.
RIGHT, SO, LOOKING AT HIM NOW, YOU
WOULDN'T... HE LOOKS FINE. HE LOOKS FINE.
BUT, I MEAN, DID HE RECOVER FULLY, OR...
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
ACTUALLY, HE SWELLS UP IN THE
FETLOCK AFTER A HARD RUN... RIGHT.
WHICH VIRTUALLY MAKES IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO RACE HIM.
SO, IN EFFECT, THIS ACTUALLY
FINISHED HIS CAREER.
IT HAS DONE, YES.
IT STILL SEEMS TO BE A BIT
AWKWARD IN THAT ONE BACK LEG.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY.
SO, POSSIBLY, THERE'S SOME SORT OF, YOU
KNOW, DEEP MUSCLE DAMAGE, SOMETHING.
YEAH, IT COULD BE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, YEAH.
ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN
NO REPORTS OF SHARKS
THIS HIGH
UP THE BRISBANE RIVER BEFORE,
ALAN TREADWELL BELIEVES
THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS A SHARK.
YET HE ONLY GLIMPSED THE WHITE
SHAPE FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND.
I WANT TO TAKE A LOGICAL APPROACH TO
DISCOVER EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
MY FIRST STRATEGY
IS TO MEASURE THE SALT CONTENT
AT THIS STRETCH
OF THE BRISBANE RIVER.
THE WATER'S SALTINESS LESSENS
THE FURTHER UPRIVER YOU GO.
I'VE TAKEN A READING OF SEAWATER
WITH THIS MACHINE,
AND THE READING I GET
IS ABOUT 17.
DOWN THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE, ANYTHING
LESS THAN ABOUT 1 IS FRESHWATER,
SO THE FACT THAT I'VE JUST GOT A READING
OF LESS THAN .5... THIS IS FRESHWATER.
I KNOW BULL SHARKS
CAN GET INTO FRESHWATER.
EVERYTHING POINTS TO THIS BEING A
SHARK ATTACK... EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.
THERE'S A GOOD REASON
WHY I DON'T THINK
THEY COULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.
LOOK AT THIS... JUST 5 MILES DOWN
THE RIVER IS THIS MAN-MADE BARRIER
THAT JUST GOES
RIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER.
MOUNT CROSBY WEIR IS A DAM THAT HAS
BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.
THE DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT BETWEEN
THE WATER ON THE OCEAN SIDE
AND THE UPRIVER SIDE
IS 12 FEET.
NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW SOMETHING MIGHT
POSSIBLY GET UP FROM THE SEA TO HERE,
BUT HOW'S IT GONNA GET
OVER THAT?
SO, WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A CLUE IN
SOMETHING ALAN TREADWELL TOLD ME.
ALTHOUGH ON THE SURFACE, THE WOUND
TO GLEN-BURNS ARM HAS HEALED,
UNDERNEATH THE SKIN, THERE IS
SUCH PROFOUND MUSCLE DAMAGE
THAT HE CAN NO LONGER RACE.
THAT IS EXACTLY THE CASE WITH ATTACKS
MADE BY ANOTHER ANIMAL ENTIRELY...
THE SALTWATER CROCODILE.
WHEN A CROCODILE BITES ITS VICTIM,
IT DEPOSITS BACTERIA IN THE WOUND
THAT CAUSE
LONG-TERM MUSCLE DAMAGE.
THE MOST DISTINCTIVE THING ABOUT A
SALTWATER CROC IS THAT BIG, GNARLY HEAD
WITH THOSE BIG, ACTUALLY BLUNT
BUT LONG, PENETRATING TEETH.
SALTWATER CROCODILES WILL LIVE
IN FRESHWATER, SALTWATER,
BRACKISH WATER, MINERAL WATER.
THEY DON'T CARE.
ONCE A CROCODILE REACHES 13, 14 FEET,
AND UP, YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN ANIMAL
THAT CAN TAKE DOWN
A ONE-TON WATER BUFFALO.
IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THE CREATURE
WHICH ATTACKED GLEN-BURNS ARM
IS NOT A SHARK BUT A CROCODILE.
WHAT THEY PREFER
IS DEEP, DARK, MURKY WATER
BECAUSE THEY ARE
THE MASTERS OF CAMOUFLAGE.
THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR PREY.
THEY WILL LAUNCH FROM AN INVISIBLE
POSITION UP OUT OF THE WATER,
GRAB WHATEVER IT IS
THEY'RE TARGETING,
DRAG IT BACK INTO THE WATER
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.
JUST THE KIND OF WATER
WHERE THE ATTACK HAPPENED.
THERE'S ONE PROBLEM
WITH THIS IDEA.
WHILE CROCS WERE ONCE FOUND
THIS FAR SOUTH,
NONE HAVE BEEN SEEN ANY CLOSER THAN
150 MILES AWAY IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.
I WOULD BE SURPRISED THAT A CROCODILE
WHO IS BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE ON A HORSE,
A, WOULD GO UNNOTICED FOR LONG PERIODS OF
TIME, YOU KNOW, WAY OUTSIDE OF ITS RANGE,
AND, B, IN THAT SITUATION,
WOULD MISS.
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S IN DEEP WATER,
IT'S A LARGE ANIMAL,
AND IT'S GOING IN TO REALLY HAVE A GO,
YOU'D BE THE LUCKIEST HORSE ALIVE.
WHEN ALL AVENUES SEEM CLOSED, I
TURN TO THE LEAST UNLIKELY OPTION
IN MY PURSUIT OF THE TRUTH.
IF THE ATTACKER WASN'T A
CROCODILE, IT HAS TO BE A SHARK.
YET I NEED TO BE CERTAIN.
IF THIS IS THE TRUTH, IT HAS
FAR-REACHING REPERCUSSIONS.
IT WOULD SHOW CONCLUSIVELY
THAT SAVAGE BULL SHARKS
CAN AND WILL LAUNCH ATTACKS
IN FRESHWATER.
IT WOULD MEAN THERE IS NO KIND OF WATER
THAT'S SAFE FROM THESE PREDATORS.
BUT I'M LOOKING FOR PROOF.
I WANT TO SHOW SCIENTIST VIC PEDDEMORS
THE WOUNDS INFLICTED ON THIS RACEHORSE.
HE'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING
EXPERTS ON SHARK BITES.
SO, WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THAT?
WELL, I'D DEFINITELY SAY IT LOOKS
LIKE A SHARK BITE OF SOME DESCRIPTION
BECAUSE OF THESE GAPS BETWEEN THE
TOOTH AND THE WAY THAT IT SEEMS
TO HAVE SCRATCHED DOWN
THE HINDQUARTER OF THE HORSE.
THAT IS THE BITE
IN MORE CONTEXT.
WOW.
I THINK THIS IS JUST A HIT WITH
THE UPPER JAW AND A SLIP DOWN.
CAN YOU GET ANY IDEA FROM THAT ROUGHLY
HOW BIG THE SHARK MIGHT HAVE BEEN?
THIS ISN'T MUCH
OF A CRESCENT,
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE JAW
MUST HAVE BEEN FAIRLY BIG.
ASSUMING THAT THAT WAS THE SORT OF... THIS
PART OF THE JAW THAT HIT IT LIKE THAT.
SO, THE CURVE
IS QUITE GENTLE.
THE CURVE
IS VERY GENTLE.
SO, IF YOU THINK OF IT AS
HITTING LIKE THAT... MM-HMM.
NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TOOTH THERE, THAT
TOOTH THERE... IT'S A FAIRLY CLOSE MATCH.
THAT'S NOT TOO FAR
OFF A MATCH.
AND THIS IS
2.75 METERS IN LENGTH.
8 OR 9 FOOT.
IT'S A VERY SIMILAR
SORT OF CURVATURE.
AND IT LINKS IN WITH
OUR KNOWLEDGE OF BULL SHARKS.
WE... ONE WOULD EXPECT
A BIGGER BULL SHARK
UP IN A VERY FRESHWATER
COMPONENT OF THE RIVER.
THIS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE CREATURE
THAT ATTACKED ALAN TREADWELL'S HORSE
IS A BULL SHARK...
OVER 8 FEET LONG.
AND BY HUNTING THROUGH
THE GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES...
I KNOW NOW HOW THESE ANIMALS
MANAGED TO GET OVER THE WEIR.
THE BRISBANE RIVER HAS FLOODED REPEATEDLY,
WITH ONE EXTREME OCCURRENCE IN 1974.
THE CITY ITSELF WAS INUNDATED, BUT
SO, TOO, WAS THE SURROUNDING AREA...
INCLUDING THE MOUNT CROSBY DAM.
IT SEEMS THAT, AS THE FLOOD
SUBSIDED, A COLONY OF BULL SHARKS,
SOME GROWING TO OVER 8 FEET LONG,
WERE LOCKED IN FAR UPRIVER.
AND IF THIS CAN HAPPEN HERE, IT CAN
HAPPEN ANYWHERE THAT BULL SHARKS ROAM.
THE DANGER THEY PRESENT
ISN'T RESTRICTED TO AUSTRALIA.
BULL SHARKS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED MOVING UP
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AS FAR AS ST. LOUIS.
AND THERE HAS EVEN BEEN AN ATTACK
REPORTED IN LAKE MICHIGAN.
TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS
THREAT, I WANT TO GET MY HANDS
ON ONE OF THESE BIG PREDATORS
IN FRESHWATER.
BUT TO DO THAT, I NEED TO LEARN
SOME SPECIALIST TECHNIQUES
FROM AN EXPERT
IN CATCHING BIG SHARKS.
HELLO, THERE.
YOU TERRY?
HOW YOU DOING? TERRY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M BEN.
HELLO, THERE.
ON MARCH 14, 2007, JUST HERE IN THE
RIVER MOUTH, TERRY HESSE CAUGHT
A 9 1/2-FOOT-LONG FEMALE BULL SHARK
ESTIMATED TO WEIGH OVER 500 POUNDS.
THIS ALL LOOKS
LIKE PRETTY SERIOUS STUFF.
YEAH, WELL, FOR OUR RODS
AND REELS, WE USE ONE OF THESE.
RIGHT... COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY
WITH THE IDEA OF USING A...
NEEDING TO USE
THAT IN A RIVER.
THESE GUYS ARE SERIOUS.
I'M IMPRESSED.
THEY'RE FISHING
IN THIS BUSY WORKING PORT
ON THE FRONTIER BETWEEN SEA
AND FRESHWATER.
ONE THING I'M NOTICING ALREADY
IS THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
THEY'VE GOT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO OUTWIT
THE SUPERSENSORY CAPACITY OF THIS SHARK.
BULL SHARKS, LIKE ALL SHARKS,
HAVE TINY PINHOLES IN THEIR SNOUT
CALLED THE AMPULLAE OF LORENZINI,
USED FOR DETECTING ELECTRICAL FIELDS.
THEY'RE SO SENSITIVE
THAT THEY CAN DETECT
THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSES
OF A FISH'S HEARTBEAT.
SHARKS WITH WIDER HEADS, LIKE THE BULL
SHARK, HAVE MORE OF THESE PINHOLES,
AND THEREFORE, THEY CAN LOCK
ONTO PREY MORE ACCURATELY.
ANOTHER ONE THERE, OR... TO AVOID GIVING
OFF ANY ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO THE SHARK,
TERRY MASKS ALL BUT THE METAL HOOK POINT
IN PLASTIC AND CABLE-TIES THIS TO THE EEL.
NEXT, TERRY'S MAKING SURE
HE CAPITALIZES
ON THE SHARK'S SMELL SENSE
BY USING FRESH BAIT.
2/3 OF THE SHARK'S BRAIN IS
DEVOTED TO SNIFFING OUT PREY.
AND BY FISHING AT NIGHT,
WE'RE CHOOSING THE MOST LIKELY
TIME FOR SHARKS TO GO HUNTING.
IT'S IN THE DARK WHEN
THE SUPERSENSORY BULL SHARK
HAS THE EDGE OVER FISH
THAT RELY MORE ON VISION.
TERRY BEGINS THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE
RIVER MOUTH TO PLACE THE BAITS.
BULL SHARKS HAVE BEEN REPORTED
TO RAM KAYAKS,
TAKING THE PADDLE SPLASH
AND RUDDER MOVEMENTS
FOR THE THRASHING
OF A FISH IN DISTRESS.
TERRY'S OKAY, BUT IN GETTING
THESE BAITS SET IN THE DARK,
I'VE INJURED MY INDEX FINGER.
IT'S GOING TO MAKE THINGS
DIFFICULT.
I'M JUST HOPING THAT THIS AND THE
DISTURBANCE FROM THE BUSY PORT
DOESN'T DAMAGE MY CHANCES.
PICK IT UP!
PICK IT UP!
AT 2:30 A.M... FISH ON!
WITH THE TIDE HIGH,
THE LINE BEGINS TO RUN.
WE'RE ON.
LET'S ACTUALLY
PUT THAT ON.
NO, OFF.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YEP.
STARTS SLOWING DOWN.
AT THE MOMENT, IT JUST FEELS
LIKE THERE'S A BOAT ON THE END.
THERE'S JUST A DEAD WEIGHT.
I'M JUST CHANGING
THE RATIO THERE.
YEAH, THAT... YEAH, THAT'S PULLING,
THAT'S PULLING, THAT'S PULLING.
IT IS COMING MY WAY.
AND WITH NEARLY 200 YARDS OF LINE TAKEN
IN, WHATEVER IT IS REACHES THE SHORE.
HOLY WHAT IS IT? THAT IS HUGE!
LIKE SOMETHING FROM ""20,000
LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA,""
IT CERTAINLY ISN'T A SHARK.
BUT WHAT ON EARTH IS IT?
IT'S NOT A SHARK,
BUT IT IS AN EXCEPTIONAL FISH.
IT'S JUST REMARKABLE.
THAT IS SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT?
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE BEFORE.
IT'S WHAT THEY CALL
A QUEENSLAND GROUPER.
THIS IS A MONSTER.
IT'S NOT THE MONSTER I WAS
AFTER, BUT THIS IS A MONSTER.
WE'RE LOOKING
AT 6 FEET AND 3 INCHES.
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRTH?
YEAH.
2'1"".
ITS GIRTH IS 4'3""... 4'3"".
THIS IS A PROTECTED MARINE
FISH NORMALLY FOUND ON REEFS.
BUT THEY'RE KNOWN TO COME INTO RIVER
MOUTHS LIKE THIS ON RARE OCCASIONS.
LOOK AT THAT.
THIS FISH... EVEN TERRY AND BEN
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS
ANYWHERE LIKE THIS SIZE,
YOU KNOW.
SO IT'S JUST AN AMAZING CATCH
AND PARTICULARLY FROM A RIVER.
JUST, YOU KNOW, THIS THING
REALLY IS A RIVER MONSTER.
GROUPERS HAVE
AN EXTRAORDINARY TRICK.
THIS 250-POUND MALE ACTUALLY
STARTED LIFE AS A FEMALE.
WHEN THERE ARE TOO FEW MALES
IN A SPAWNING GROUP,
A FEMALE WILL SWITCH SEX
TO KEEP BREEDING NUMBERS UP.
OH. HA!
TIME, THOUGH, FOR THIS GENDER
BENDER TO HEAD BACK HOME.
TO ME, THAT JUST UNDERLINES
EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAVE NO IDEA AT
ALL WHAT IS DOWN THERE IN OUR RIVERS.
IT FEELS AMAZING TO CATCH A FISH LIKE
THAT, BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
ARMED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I'VE GAINED
FROM TERRY, I'M DRIVING 50 MILES UPRIVER
FROM BRACKISH WATER
TO FRESHWATER.
I'M FISHING AT NIGHT.
I'M FISHING
WITH THE FRESHEST BAIT.
SO... AND I'M PUTTING
OUT TWO RODS.
HERE WE GO. LOOK.
SOMETHING...
SOMETHING HAD THAT.
BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE
THE HOOK IN ITS MOUTH.
SO, WHATEVER IT WAS, IT'S STILL OUT THERE,
AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF BAIT NOW, SO...
IT'S ANNOYING.
FINALLY, I'M IN LUCK.
I'VE GOT A TAKE
ON THE OTHER ROD.
AND KEEP IT AWAY FROM SOME TREES
AND STUFF ON THE SIDE THERE.
YEAH, IT'S A SHARK.
IT'S A SHARK.
UP WE COME.
THIS IS A SHARK IN A RIVER.
OKAY.
THIS MAY BE A SMALL ONE, BUT FOR ME,
THIS IS, IN SOME WAYS, MORE UNSETTLING.
UP ONTO THE GRASS.
I ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE
BIG FEMALES IN THIS RIVER.
CATCHING ONE LIKE THIS IMPLIES
THEY'RE BREEDING HERE.
THAT BODY IS JUST SOLID MUSCLE.
YOU JUST FEEL IT.
WHEN IT DECIDES TO FLEX, THAT'S
JUST GOT SO MUCH STRENGTH THERE.
THIS ONE DIDN'T SWIM
ALL THE WAY FROM THE OCEAN.
IT WAS MOST LIKELY BORN IN
BRACKISH WATER JUST DOWNSTREAM.
AND WHILE ONLY 18 MONTHS OLD, IT
SEEMS TO BE THRIVING IN FRESHWATER.
IT'S A SCARY THOUGHT
THAT THIS RIVER
WILL BE ITS HUNTING GROUND
FOR LIFE... ANOTHER 15 YEARS.
""AT 3'6"" LONG
AND 15 POUNDS IN WEIGHT,
THIS ONE COULD TRIPLE IN LENGTH
AND BECOME 30 TIMES HEAVIER.
I'M JUST TRYING TO IMAGINE THIS THING TWO
OR THREE TIMES THE LENGTH IN THIS WATER.
IT'S QUITE A FRIGHTENING PROSPECT
IN A RIVER, A SMALL RIVER.
ANYWAY, THIS ONE'S GOING BACK.
WELL, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVE,
WITHOUT QUESTION,
THAT BULL SHARKS ARE TRESPASSING
ON MY PATCH, IN FRESHWATER,
MORE THAN 80 MILES
UP AN AUSTRALIAN RIVER.
BUT CRITICALLY, WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT
THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR BRUTAL ATTACKS
IN FRESHWATER ALMOST ANYWHERE.
THERE ARE FEW LIMITS TO WHERE
THIS SHARK WILL OPERATE.
MORE AND MORE, IT SEEMS
THAT THIS FRESHWATER JAWS
IS BRINGING ITS SAVAGERY
INTO OUR ONCE-TAME BACKYARD.
ALONG METROPOLITAN CANALS, UP QUIET
RIVERS, AND ON TRANQUIL LAKES,
THE BULL SHARK IS LOOKING
FOR ITS NEXT MEAL.
IT'S JUST A QUESTION
OF WHO AND WHEN.","The payara, (Hydrolycus scomberoides), is a species of dogtooth tetra. This predatory fish is found in the Amazon Basin in tropical South America. It was the first of four species to be described in the genus Hydrolycus.


== Description ==
The most noticeable feature of H. scomberoides is the two long fangs protruding from its lower jaw. These are used to impale their prey, mostly smaller fish. It typically reaches a standard length of about 30 cm (1.0 ft), but can reach up to 51 cm (1 ft 8 in). There are reports of far larger individuals, up to 117 cm (3 ft 10 in) in total length and 17.8 kg (39 lb 4 oz) in weight, based on records by IGFA, but this likely involves confusion with the related H. armatus.
H. scomberoides is overall silvery with a dark spot behind the opercle and another at the lower base of the pectoral fin. In adults the tail is dusky on the basal half, turning paler (more transparent) towards the tip.


== In the aquarium ==
The payara, which is also sold as the saber tooth barracuda, vampire fish, vampire tetra, or saber tusk barracuda, is a popular species for large, aggressive aquariums. It requires a large aquarium and can only be mixed with relatively large species, as smaller will be seen as potential prey.

Chainsaw Predator,Largetooth Sawfish,Pristis pristis,"My name's Jeremy Wade.
For as long as I can remember,
I've had a passion
that verges on obsession.
Dangerous freshwater fish have
got me well and truly hooked.
Their deadly reputations
have always fascinated me,
as well as their methods
of attack.
I think we've got one.
[thunder crashes]
In rivers around the world,
I've seen everything from
giant, venom-coated stings
to tiny assassins
that drill into flesh.
I've held a fish that could
slice off my arm,
smelled the breath of a beast
that inhales its victims whole,
and felt the hammer blow
of an 80-pound battering ram.
Yet, of all the nasty devices
I've come across,
there is one murderous-looking
weapon that really stands out.
It belongs to a sea monster
that swims hundreds of miles
up rivers...
A monster that has completely
eluded me until now.
Fish on! Fish on!
Wade: Nearly 20 years ago,
on my first fishing trip
to the Amazon,
I was in a hardware store,
looking for rope
and other supplies,
when I caught sight of something
that stopped me
dead in my tracks.
It was about a yard long,
with a profile
just like a chainsaw...
Except that each
vicious-looking point
was fully 2 inches long.
What I'd stumbled upon
was the snout, or rostrum,
of a fish the locals called
the araguaguá.
This is an animal I'd been
vaguely aware of from my youth
but which I'd never
actually seen.
In the comics and adventure
books of my childhood,
this creature was normally
depicted as a sea monster,
usually brandishing
its serrated weapon
at terrified skin divers.
But I don't ever remember
seeing a picture of a real one.
And until that hardware store
in Brazil,
I'd no idea that this large
and wickedly armed fish
might swim up rivers.
Wade: The animal in question
is known is English
as a sawfish.
Giants over 20 feet long
have occasionally been caught.
And legend has it
that these monsters
will even attack boats.
In the 16th century,
the Swedish chronicler
Olaus Magnus states
that this terrifying fish
will ""Swim under ships
and cut them,
that the water may come in,
and he may feed on the men
when the ship is drowned.""
More recently,
a story from India talks
of a man hacked in two.
If those accounts
sound farfetched,
then more believable perhaps
is this newspaper article
from the 1930s about an attack
off the coast of Florida.
The story goes that a fisherman
harpooned a large sawfish
in shallow water.
But when the brute spun 'round
and struck the boat
with its snout,
the tables were suddenly turned.
[screaming]
Wade: I shudder to imagine
that rack of teeth
scything into human flesh.
[groans]
Despite severe injuries,
the victim in this instance
appears to have survived.
[panting]
But I've long wondered if
the animal that attacked him
could be the most fearsome
of any fish to lurk in a river.
As I prepare to go
in search of one,
two questions are
at the front of my mind.
Why is such
a large sea-dwelling predator
coming into freshwater?
And is the sawfish
as deadly as it looks?
Once common
throughout the tropics,
sawfish are now
increasingly hard to find.
Commercial fishing in particular
has taken a heavy toll.
Decades of overkill
have almost wiped them out.
To track down this rare beast,
I'm heading
to Australia's wild northwest.
[birds squawking]
I've come
to the remote Fitzroy River,
one of the last strongholds
of the so-called
freshwater sawfish.
Somewhere here, so I've heard,
lurks a creature barely changed
since the age of the dinosaurs.
At the mouth of the river,
I venture
into unfamiliar territory.
This is a no-man's-land
of shifting mud
and treacherous currents.
But the dangers I can see
are only half the picture.
Hidden below the surface
are some of the world's
most notorious man-eaters.
Come on.
I've been granted
special permission
to try and catch the critically
endangered sawfish.
This puts me
in a truly privileged position.
Yet in such a vast area,
there's no guarantee
I'll even find one.
Hundreds of square miles
of open water.
It is ridiculous.
The warm, shallow water
at the mouth of the Fitzroy
is prime sawfish habitat.
20 years ago, a local fisherman
snagged an 18-footer
not far from here.
Pretty lively.
Uh...
Yeah. That's something.
Yeah, if I hadn't seen
what was responsible for that,
I might be getting
quite excited there.
I might be thinking
that was something toothy,
but that's crab claw marks.
Everything is hungry down here.
Wade: Out of the corner
of my eye,
I'm aware
of a more sinister predator.
For a saltwater crocodile,
humans as well as crabs
are fair game.
This wouldn't be a good place
to fall in.
[reel winding]
Okay.
I got something on there.
This time, I'm hooked
into something meaty.
It's only day one, but I wonder
if I'm about to get lucky.
That's actually running.
Back a little. Back a little.
Back. Back. Back.
Oh, here we go.
Coming up. Coming up.
Okay. Okay.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
I'm gonna take this easy,
'cause I can't actually...
I can't get a positive I.D.
in the water.
It's very muddy water.
Oh, it's a shark.
It's a shark.
This estuary's
just full of predators.
Wade: Bull shark.
I keep well clear of its mouth.
Even a 5-foot juvenile
could bite my hand off.
The adults can reach 13 feet
and probably kill more people
than any other shark.
This is one
of the few sea dwellers
which, like sawfish,
can swim up rivers.
[chuckles]
Well, that was a bit of drama.
I'm glad we got that in.
It's always exciting
to get a fish like that in
on light tackle.
But a bit of disappointment...
That's not the fish
that I'm after.
I'm after something that looks
actually quite similar to that,
so I've got it all to do again.
Next time the line goes,
I want it to be a big sawfish,
not a bull shark.
Physically, sawfish resemble
sharks quite closely.
They have
shark-like dorsal fins,
a long body,
and a high, sweeping tail.
In other ways,
they're more like
their true ancestors... rays.
The gills, for example,
sit underneath,
the head is flat,
and the mouth is a narrow slit.
But it's the snout
that intrigues me.
Despite its vicious profile,
few have ever seen it in action.
Malcolm Douglas is an exception.
This real-life Crocodile Dundee
has witnessed nature's
very own chainsaw massacre.
In '67, I was up around Darwin,
and just as we come out
of this creek in the morning,
I saw something.
I saw a big school of mullet
all cruising and all
sort of huddling together.
And I said to my mate, I said,
""Something's stressing
those mullet.""
And next thing, this massive saw
come up between them,
and it just went, ""Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!""
Faster than a speeding bullet,
as they say.
And then he just came through
gobbling them up.
And then he turned around again,
and he did that several times.
We just thought that was
the most fantastic thing
that we ever saw.
The saw on that...
I measured it from memory...
Was around about 8 foot long.
- A saw?
- Yeah, the saw itself.
Yeah, it's huge.
I'm not exaggerating.
I'm not prone to exaggeration.
Wade: This high-spec weapon
is stuffed with sensors
that pick up not just
the movement of nearby animals,
but also their electrical aura.
Even in total darkness,
a sawfish can nail its target.
According to Malcolm, they also
use their saw in self-defense.
You nearly had a rack of those
going into your leg.
Yeah, not nice.
As the dry season
comes on here, you get...
The Fitzroy gets
very shallow, right?
And these sawfish
will hang around quite often
in the shallow water.
Now, if you trap a sawfish
between the bank
and the deep channel,
he will come at you
with that saw.
And he'll just lash around like
this. This is his protection.
Now, if you get hit in the leg
or the arm or the stomach,
it's not a pretty sight.
It'd almost be worse
than a crocodile bite
because it's a rip right
through, like this, you know?
And then they'd come back,
and they'd hit you two
or three times.
Right.
Wade: The dry season
is the only time
you can explore
the Fitzroy River,
at least by vehicle.
During the rains,
all of this is underwater.
I head to a deep channel
known as Telegraph Pool.
By moving a few miles inland,
I'm hoping to improve my chances
of catching a sawfish.
Strong tides bring a lot
of smaller fish
into this lower section
of the river,
making it a rich hunting ground
for large predators.
Some are already lining up.
With crocodiles, they say
it's the ones you can't see
that you have to worry about...
Hardly reassuring
when they vanish without trace
into muddy water.
We're just waiting
for nightfall,
but it's good to stay
to the tide, as well.
The tide will be coming up soon.
Apparently, the sawfish move up
with the tide.
If they move up with the tide,
I move down with the tide.
So, I've just got
a couple of baits out.
Yeah, it's all looking
very fishy at the moment.
A few locals
also brave this spot.
Most are after barramundi,
a sport fish prized
for its fighting spirit.
In general, though, anglers
want to avoid sawfish,
which can rip lines
as well as flesh.
To boost my chances,
I've set up two rods.
By sunset, my baits
are still untouched.
And as darkness falls,
the mood grows more sinister.
It's not just the crocs
that are making me edgy.
People have lived here
for tens of thousands of years,
and their spirits seem
to haunt the shadows.
With each passing hour,
I feel more like a trespasser
in someone else's world.
[birds squawking]
Daylight comes as a relief
and then brings
an unexpected breakthrough.
Do you want a hand with that?
- Yeah, please.
- [chuckles]
Another fisherman up early
before the heat of the day
has accidentally hooked
a sawfish.
This 2-footer is a mere pup,
but an extra pair of hands
still doesn't go amiss.
Were you fishing
for these, or...
- No, barramundi.
- Barramundi. Right.
- And I've caught
everything but.
- Right.
- This is the first one
of these I've seen.
- Okay.
I'm out of range now.
It's only a small one.
Wade: This baby sawfish is
the monster in miniature
and my first chance
to get a safe look
at this bizarre animal.
Wow.
Right. That's the first one
of these I've seen.
Imagine one of these things
20 foot long,
which is what they grow to
when they get into the sea.
But, yeah,
it's just like a shark
if you look
at the back end of it.
Come forward, that's just like
a ray's mouth...
A stingray's mouth.
But, you know,
that is the unique feature.
And even on a small one
like this, just look...
You know, that's quite
a fearsome weapon.
I'm actually aware
this is a small one.
Very good thing to see, because
for a fish like this to exist...
And this is probably
about a year old...
There have to be
breeding-size adults around.
Fantastic.
I wish I caught it myself.
I'm here to catch a monster.
But for now, I just want
to return the pup unharmed.
[sighs]
Just moving the tail to get
the circulation going a bit.
Wade:
Sawfish travel more than
200 miles up the Fitzroy River,
deep into
the arid Australian outback.
I want to know why they swim
so far into freshwater
and how dangerous
they are to humans.
The aborigines have lived
with these predators
for at least 50,000 years.
Sawfish feature
in their tribal dances.
And in one
of their dream-time stories,
the animal uses its huge saw
to gouge out the rivers
of the land.
Well, I'm now over 150 miles
from the coast
and on my way to meet
some of the Bunuba tribe.
They call this stretch of river
darngku, or deep water,
and I can see why.
The white band along the cliffs
is a stark warning
of how far this river rises
during the rains.
For 30 feet above me, the rocks
have been scrubbed clean.
With help from the Bunuba,
I'm hoping to catch
my first sawfish.
But I also want
to find out from them
how dangerous it really is.
Since coming here,
I've already picked up
one story of an attack
from northern Australia.
60 years ago, two fishermen
were smashed clean out of their
boat by one of these creatures.
[indistinct shouting]
What spooks me about this story
is not the men's injuries...
Incredibly, they escaped
virtually unscathed.
But according to the report,
the boat's solid wooden hull
was punctured
by the animal's teeth,
such was the force
of one of its blows.
[birds squawking]
The aborigines have
long hunted sawfish for food
and are still allowed
to catch them.
As an outsider, though,
I'm not sure how they'll take
to me fishing for one
in their waters.
Around here, it's mostly
the women who do the fishing.
So it's their knowledge
I want to tap into.
Mary Aitken is an elder
from the Bunuba tribe.
She grew up on this river
and begins by recounting
the story of a large sawfish
that she caught here
many years ago.
Wade:
How many were you?
And you couldn't take it?
It seems the fish
was almost too big
for the back of Mary's pickup.
So you just got it
on the back of the... yeah.
So, what about children?
When they go fishing here,
they're catching small fish,
and then they get one
of these sawfish on the line,
I mean, do they ever get hurt
by them?
Wade: Then Mary hands me
the largest saw I've ever seen.
The savage potential
of this ready-made weapon
certainly hasn't been lost
on humans.
There are records
of sawfish rostrums
being used as weapons
right across
the western Pacific,
from the Philippines
down through New Guinea
as far as New Zealand.
They'd use it to slice open
the abdomens of their enemies
and also to open up the veins
on the inside of the elbows,
causing fatal bleeding.
And even just a couple of years
ago here in Australia,
a couple of burglars
attacked a man in a caravan
using a sawfish rostrum,
and they put him in hospital.
[footsteps departing]
But whether the sawfish itself
sets out to attack people
is less clear.
So far, the evidence is about
as shadowy as the beast itself.
[birds calling]
Wade: By mid dry season,
the Fitzroy has shrunk
from a raging torrent
into a series of quiet pools
with little or no moving water.
This ought
to concentrate the sawfish
and make them easier to find.
But before I go looking,
I'll need plenty of fresh bait.
Mary catches hers with a throw
net and makes it look easy.
It's a method I've seen people
use all 'round the world
but have never tried myself.
What's that? Is that
a bream or something?
Yep.
The theory could hardly
be simpler...
Cast a circle, and your net
covers the greatest
possible area,
thus snagging more fish.
All right.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Lovely.
With fresh bait on her line,
Mary is quickly
into her fishing.
Meanwhile, I'm getting
into a bit of a muddle.
- [laughs]
- That was a square.
[chuckling]
After a slow start,
I finally won some respect,
and Mary lets me in
on a few good fishing spots
along the gorge.
Sawfish have roamed the earth
for at least
a hundred million years.
Yet the rocks under my feet are
nearly four times this old.
My walkabout takes me to
the top of a limestone cliff...
The remnant
of a once-mighty barrier reef
that lay beneath
an ancient ocean.
Beyond the horizon,
parts of this continent
date back four billion years.
That's almost as old
as life itself.
I'm looking for a stretch
of water with a deep channel,
the kind of place where
a big sawfish might lie up.
I've got the whole river
to myself.
And with limited time,
I'm eager to get fishing.
This is about as simple
as fishing gets, I suppose...
Just using a hand line.
So, there's the hook
down in the water,
a little bit of lead
holding the bait in place,
and this end, just a winder.
And this is what the locals use,
so I'm just giving it a go.
And they'll tend to go away
and just come back
and check the line
after a couple of hours,
make sure it's fastened
to something.
They tend to look
a bit askance at me
sitting actually holding
the line.
But, you know, I've only got
a limited time here.
I want to feel
when something comes along,
make sure the hook sets.
But from their point of view,
I'm wasting energy
and also sitting out in the sun
unnecessarily.
All that remains now
is to sit and wait
for something to find the bait.
As the hours slip by, I try out
several spots along the river.
By midafternoon,
the only animals
I've managed to flush out
are a bunch of cockatoos.
[birds squawking]
Surprisingly, the shallow pools
are still full of life.
Even in the dry season,
there are plenty of shrimp
and bream to be found.
This will be good ammunition
for later.
As I return to camp, I wonder
if the abundance of food
might explain why sawfish
come so far upriver.
If the pickings are rich enough
and you can adapt
to freshwater, then why not?
Recently in South Africa,
I caught huge adult bull sharks
which were swimming
way into freshwater
for just this reason.
Wade: But if the same
is true of sawfish,
then why aren't
I hearing stories
of giant,
20-foot river monsters?
It occurs to me that even here,
in what's thought to be one
of their last strongholds,
these prehistoric beasts
could be vanishing.
Perhaps darkness will draw
a sawfish out of its lair.
It's often said they're
more active at night.
Just in case I doze off,
I tie an empty can to the line.
Should anything run off
with the bait,
the noise of it moving
will wake me up.
I'm over 150 miles from
the mouth of the river here.
But apparently in the past,
according to Mary,
there have been some big sawfish
caught from this very place.
Wade: A long day baking
in the outback sun
has left me exhausted,
but my overcooked brain
refuses to switch off.
I still have little sense
of how dangerous sawfish are
to people.
Back in that hardware store
20 years ago,
the answer seemed obvious.
Yet for such a large
and viciously armed beast,
I'd have expected
a lot more bad press...
Especially from populated areas
where sawfish were once common.
[indistinct shouting]
After all, this is a fish said
to have hacked a man in two.
Wade: After a day of fishing
without success,
darkness has
finally brought me a bite.
My bare hands take the strain
as I wind in the line.
But the fish on the end
is not what I'm expecting.
Bull shark.
A bull shark this far inland
is a real eye-opener.
These aggressive fish
are clearly thriving here,
even during the dry season,
when this part of the river
is little more
than a stagnant pond.
So, a pretty hostile
environment...
You can see why everything in
there basically is tooled up.
You know, the sawfish possibly
needs that weaponry for defense.
Who knows?
Anyway,
I'd better put this back.
I just hope
I don't hook him up again.
There he goes.
Even though I know bull sharks
come up, you know,
in freshwater...
You know, it's still
really strange seeing them here.
But the monster I'm after
is nowhere to be seen.
Wade: It was only recently
that outsiders realized there
were sawfish in this river
and began to study them.
I'm leaving Darngku and heading
a hundred miles back downstream
to hook up with a small
sawfish-research team.
Perhaps their knowledge
can help me in my quest.
I turn off the main highway
to a dusty outpost
called Camballin
and then follow a dirt track
to an abandoned irrigation dam.
For most of the year,
this man-made barrier stops
sawfish swimming upstream.
They accumulate below the dam,
making this an ideal spot
for the research team.
Dr. Dave Morgan,
who leads the research,
is passionate about sawfish.
By tagging and tracking
individual fish,
he's starting to build up a
picture of their secret lives.
But as we head out
to set trapping nets,
we're busy watching our backs.
Crocodiles seem to be
following our activity
with a predatory interest.
This is risky work.
If you get too focused
on the crocs
and take your eye off
what's under your nose,
you can wind up
getting karate-chopped
by a sawfish in the net.
Just trying to do it
from a boat in a deep section,
that's when you often
get hit a lot.
But when you don't want
to get out of the boat...
'cause there's
saltwater crocodiles around.
Then, yeah, you get hit.
I've yet to lock horns
with a sawfish,
but just the thought
of being nailed by a croc
is making me jumpy.
In the dark, murky water,
I can't make out
what's in the net.
Yeah, definitely is a real
kick, kick, kick like that.
No, can you see that?
Croc, bull shark, or sawfish,
this has to be
the lucky dip from hell.
Man:
Yeah, I saw him. Yep.
Just be careful, mate.
It could be a bull shark
or a freshwater,
saltwater crocodile.
Will they get 'round
to the nets?
Will they come and take
the fish out of the nets?
Well, the freshies
generally go for catfish,
but the salties definitely
prefer the barramundi.
I'm starting to wish
I was somewhere else.
Well, they'll churn them
in the net...
Right.
So he'll try
and fight you for them.
Oh.
Shall I attempt to grab that?
Yeah.
- Is that...
- Grab him by the tail.
Just...
Okay.
Well, no sawfish in the net,
but this is a bull shark.
Okay.
Wade: I'd normally be fired up
to find bull sharks
so far upstream in freshwater,
but they're starting
to feel like a plague.
And I wonder how many more
I might have to pull out
from this crocodile soup
before I find a sawfish.
I'm told that the annual flood
was lower than normal this year,
making it hard for sawfish
to move upstream.
At any rate,
the last nets are all empty.
[thunder crashing]
With cruel irony,
daylight brings the threat
of an unseasonal storm.
Out here in the bush,
heavy rain can spell trouble.
[birds squawking]
The timing is
absolutely crucial.
If I was here in the wet season,
I'd be sitting underwater,
which is precisely why we
come now in the dry season.
Not only
is the river accessible,
but also the fact
that it's down about 30 foot,
the fish are more confined.
The problem is, is that the
weather actually is changing.
We had the wind blowing.
We had rain last night.
And there's real concern
at the moment
that, if there's any more rain,
the tracks leading in here
are gonna become impassable,
so everyone's keeping an eye
on the weather.
If there is signs
of things turning bad,
we're just gonna have to throw
everything in the vehicles
and get out of here,
and that will be
a premature end to my mission.
[thunder crashes]
With a big storm approaching,
the research team has no choice
but to beat a retreat.
Yet it seems there is
still a glimmer of hope.
To stay one step ahead
of the weather,
we head back to Telegraph Pool.
Wade: This is my last chance
to catch the monster
that I've waited
nearly 20 years to see.
While Dave and his team prepare
for another night of trapping,
I return...
Superstitiously, perhaps...
To the exact spot where
I released the baby sawfish.
Maybe this is where my prayers
will finally be answered.
[birds chirping]
[reel winding]
Oh.
Fish on! Fish on!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Good size. Good size.
It's coming in quite close.
It's already quite...
I'm gonna get over
these rocks in here.
I'm gonna need someone
to grab it.
I think it's ready.
It's ready, I think.
Oh! It's a sawfish.
It's a sawfish.
At last, the animal
that's been swimming around
in my head for nearly 20 years.
Yeah.
Here we go.
My first sawfish.
Look at this for a beast.
This thing's nearly 7 foot long.
It's bigger than I am.
And that rostrum on there...
That's a foot and a half long.
It's got 39 of those teeth.
Each one is about an inch long,
wickedly sharp.
You've got that huge dorsal fin,
a very big second dorsal fin,
a very big tail,
and they anchor the body.
And when the body flexes,
it's this head and this rostrum
that really scythe
from side to side.
It's about to tense.
We about to have a splash?
Yeah, here we go.
Yeah.
[grunts]
Yeah.
Wade: This journey began
almost 20 years ago.
In the heart of the Amazon,
I stood staring
at a vicious-looking weapon
and wondered if I'd ever see
its owner in the flesh.
Now, in a remote river
in Australia,
I finally got my hands
on a live sawfish.
So I hold that down and...
The scientists, meanwhile,
think they've figured out
why these creatures
come into freshwater.
It's flat on the rostrum.
Dave's latest measurements show
that they're using
the Fitzroy as a nursery.
Acoustic tag going in, here.
Despite all the predators,
it's still safer here
than in the sea.
Only when they reach
8 or 9 feet long
do sawfish leave the river.
As an adult living in saltwater,
this fish could one day
become a 20-foot giant.
But I came here to find out
if this fish is also a monster
in terms of deed.
Now, there's no doubt that
that fearsome, toothed rostrum
is potentially a lethal weapon,
and it's certainly been used
as such in the hands of humans.
But I can find just no instance
at all of this fish
having attacked
a human being willfully.
In other words,
its monstrous appearance is
not matched by its behavior.
Certainly,
if you're a small fish,
this thing is a deadly weapon.
But from
the human point of view,
the sawfish is
the archetypal gentle giant.
Sawfish are as tough
as they come.
This one has already
shrugged off a shark bite
as well as a recent croc attack.
Yet, in a world full of nets,
the very weapon
it needs to survive
is now liable to get it
snagged and killed.
My only fear as it swims away
is that we may be seeing
the last of these ancient
and extraordinary monsters.","The largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis, syn. P. microdon and P. perotteti) is a species of sawfish in the family Pristidae. It is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, but also enters freshwater. It has declined drastically and is now critically endangered.
A range of English names have been used for the species, or populations now part of the species, including common sawfish (despite it being far from common today), wide sawfish, freshwater sawfish, river sawfish  (less frequently, other sawfish species also occur in freshwater and rivers), Leichhardt's sawfish (after explorer and naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt) and northern sawfish.


== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of Pristis pristis in relations to P. microdon (claimed range: Indo-West Pacific) and P. perotteti (claimed range: Atlantic and East Pacific) has historically caused considerable confusion, but evidence published in 2013 revealed that the three are conspecific, as morphological and genetic differences are lacking. As a consequence, recent authorities treat P. microdon and P. perotteti as synonyms of P. pristis.
Based on an analysis of NADH-2 genes there are three main clades of P. pristis: Atlantic, Indo-West Pacific and East Pacific.
Its scientific name Pristis (both the genus and specific name) is derived from the Greek word for saw.


== Description ==

The largetooth sawfish possibly reaches up to 7.5 m (25 ft) in total length, but the largest confirmed was a West African individual that was 7 m (23 ft) long. An individual caught in 1951 at Galveston, Texas, which was documented on film but not measured, has been estimated to be of similar size. Today most individuals are far smaller and a typical length is 2–2.5 m (6.6–8.2 ft). Large individuals may weigh as much as 500–600 kg (1,102–1,323 lb), or possibly even more.
The largetooth sawfish is easily recognized by the forward position of the dorsal fin with its leading edge placed clearly in front of the leading edge of the pelvic fins (when the sawfish is seen from above or the side), the relatively long pectoral fins with angular tips, and the presence of a small lower tail lobe. In all other sawfish species the leading edge of their dorsal fin is placed at, or behind, the leading edge of the pelvic fins, and all other Pristis sawfish species have shorter pectoral fins with less pointed tips and lack a distinct lower tail lobe (very small or none). The rostrum (""saw"") of the largetooth sawfish has a width that is 15–25% of its length, which is relatively wide compared to the other sawfish species, and there are 14–24 equally separated teeth on each side of it. On average, females have shorter rostrums with fewer teeth than males. The rostral teeth are large and grooved from base to tip.  The proportional rostrum length also varies with age, with average being around 27% of the total length of the fish, but can be as high as 30% in juveniles and as low as 20–22% in adults.
Its upperparts are generally grey to yellowish-brown, often with a clear yellow tinge to the fins. Individuals in freshwater may have a reddish colour caused by blood suffusion below the skin. The underside is greyish or white.


== Distribution and habitat ==

The largetooth sawfish can be found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, but it also enters freshwater and has been recorded in rivers as far as 1,340 km (830 mi) from the sea. Historically, its East Atlantic range was from Mauritania to Angola. There are old reports (last in the late 1950s or shortly after) from the Mediterranean and these have typically been regarded as vagrants, but a review of records strongly suggests that this sea had a breeding population. Its West Atlantic range was from Uruguay to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Although there are claimed reports from several Gulf Coast states in the United States, a review indicates that only those from Texas are genuine. Other specimens, notably several claimed to be from Florida, were likely imported from other countries. Its East Pacific range was from Peru to Mazatlán in Mexico. Historically it was widespread in the Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa to the Horn of Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Its total distribution covered almost 7,200,000 km2 (2,800,000 sq mi), more than any other species of sawfish, but it has disappeared from much of its historical range. The last record taken in the Mediterranean dates back to 1959. A parasitic flatworm, Dermopristis paradoxus, is commonly found on the skin and lining of the mouth and exclusively in Australian waters on the largetooth sawfish. The flatworm has been discovered to have a male reproductive system that lacks the copulatory organ.
Adults are primarily found in estuaries and marine waters to a depth of 25 m (82 ft), but mostly less than 10 m (33 ft). Nevertheless, the species does appear to have a greater affinity for freshwater habitats than the smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata), green sawfish (P. zijsron), and dwarf sawfish (P. clavata). Largetooth sawfish from the population in Lake Nicaragua appear to spend most, if not all, of their life in freshwater, but tagging surveys indicate that at least some do move between this lake and the sea. Captive studies show that this euryhaline species can thrive long-term in both salt and freshwater, regardless of its age, and that an acclimation from salt to freshwater is faster than the opposite. In captivity they are known to be agile (even swimming backwards), have an unusual ability to ""climb"" with the use of the pectoral fins and they can jump far out of the water; a 1.8-metre-long (5.9 ft) individual jumped to a height of 5 m (16 ft). It has been suggested that this may be adaptions for traversing medium-sized waterfalls and rapids when moving upriver. They are generally found in areas with a bottom consisting of sand, mud or silt. The preferred water temperature is between 24 and 32 °C (75–90 °F), and 19 °C (66 °F) or colder is lethal.


== Behavior and life cycle ==
Sexual maturity is reached at a length of about 2.8–3 m (9.2–9.8 ft) when 7–10 years old. Breeding is seasonal in this ovoviviparous species, but the exact timing appears to vary depending on the region. The adult females can breed once every 1–2 years, the gestation period is about five months, and there are indications that mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young. There are 1–13 (average c. 7) young in each litter, which are 72–90 cm (28–35 in) long at birth. They are likely typically born in salt or brackish water near river mouths, but move into freshwater where the young spend the first 3–5 years of their life, sometimes as much as 400 km (250 mi) upriver. In the Amazon basin the largetooth sawfish has been reported even further upstream, and this mostly  involves young individuals that are up to 2 m (6.6 ft) long. Occasionally, young individuals become isolated in freshwater pools during floods and may live there for years. The potential lifespan of the largetooth sawfish is unknown, but four estimates suggested 30 years, 35 years, 44 years, and 80 years.
The largetooth sawfish is a predator that feeds on fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The ""saw"" can be used both to stir up the bottom to find prey and to slash at groups of fish. Sawfish are docile and harmless to humans, except when captured where they can inflict serious injuries when defending themselves with the ""saw"".


== Conservation ==

As suggested by the alternative name common sawfish, it was once plentiful, but has now declined drastically leading to it being considered a critically endangered species by the IUCN. The main threat is overfishing, but it also suffers from habitat loss. Both their fins (used in shark fin soup) and ""saw"" (as novelty items) are highly valuable, and the meat is used as food. Because of the ""saw"" they are particularly prone to becoming entangled in fishing nets. Historically sawfish were also harvested for the oil in their liver. In the Niger Delta region of southern Nigeria, sawfish (known as oki in Ijaw and neighbouring languages) are traditionally hunted for their saws, which are used in masquerades.
The largetooth sawfish has been extirpated from many regions where formerly present. Among the 75 countries where recorded historically, it has disappeared from 28 and may have disappeared from another 27, leaving only 20 countries where certainly still present. In terms of area this means that it certainly survives in only 39% of its historical range. Only Australia still has a relatively healthy population of the species and this may be the last remaining population in the entire Indo-Pacific that is of sufficient size to be viable, but even it has experienced a decline. Other places in the Indo-Pacific where still present, even if in very low numbers, are off Eastern Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Papua New Guinea, and in the East Pacific it survives off Central America, Colombia and northern Peru. Whether it survives anywhere in Southeast Asia is generally unclear, but one was captured in the Philippines in 2014 (a country where otherwise considered extirpated). The species has disappeared from much of its Atlantic range and declined where still present. The likely largest remaining population in this region is in the Amazon estuary, but another important population is in the San Juan River system in Central America. It was once abundant in Lake Nicaragua (part of the San Juan River system), but this population rapidly crashed during the 1970s when tens of thousands were caught. It has been protected in Nicaragua since the early 1980s, but remains rare in the lake today, and is now threatened by the planned Nicaragua Canal. In West Africa, the Bissagos Archipelago has often been considered the last remaining stronghold, but interviews with locals indicate that sawfish now also are rare there.
All sawfish species were added to CITES Appendix I in 2007, thereby restricting international trade. As the first marine fish, there was an attempt of having it listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2003 by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service, but it was declined. However, it was listed as P. perotteti under the ESA in 2011. Following taxonomic changes, the ESA  listing was updated to P. pristis in December 2014. Sawfish are protected in Australia and the United States where a number of conservation projects have been initiated, but the largetooth sawfish has probably already been extirpated from the latter country (last confirmed record in 1961 from Nueces, Texas). Additionally it receives a level of protection in Bangladesh, Brazil, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Senegal and South Africa, but illegal fishing continues, enforcement of fishing laws is often lacking and it has already disappeared from some of these countries.
Largetooth sawfish, especially young, are sometimes eaten by crocodiles and large sharks.

This species is the most numerous sawfish in public aquariums, but it is often listed under the synonym P. microdon. Studbooks included 16 individuals (10 males, 6 females) in North American aquariums in 2014, 5 individuals (3 males, 2 females) in European aquariums in 2013, and 13 individuals (6 males, 7 females) in Australian aquariums in 2017. Others are kept at public aquariums in Asia.

Electric Executioner,Electric Eel,Electrophorus electricus,"Wade: I'm Jeremy Wade, biologist
and monster wrangler.
[grunts]
I've spent the last 25 years
traveling the globe,
bringing in these giants.
There it is.
Look at that for a fish.
Much of this time was in Brazil,
where I've caught
many monsters before.
Red-belly piranha.
[horse whinnies]
I'm back to investigate a new
story about a triple homicide.
The people who fell in the water
actually disappeared.
This is like no creature
I've tackled before.
But this thing is different.
It has invisible powers.
Chasing this monster
takes me into the heart
of Brazil's rugged frontier,
where people fear for my life.
He says it will kill you,
no two ways about it.
And it leads to possibly
the strangest monster catch
of my career.
[electricity crackles]
I've chased river monsters
all over the world,
but I've always considered
Brazil my second home.
There's the fish.
There's the fish.
This is where I've done
most of my fishing...
Look at this!
Catching all manner
of freshwater killers.
I've been drawn back
by a chilling story
about the death
of a group of cowboys.
I've heard of a river monster
taking an individual before...
[man screams]
but never three people at once.
This is a new killer for me.
Wade: My journey begins
in Brazil's wild west.
Pará state is cowboy country,
and outsiders rarely visit,
but I'm on my way to meet
an eyewitness
to the cowboys' deaths.
I'm traveling by boat
along the Tocantins River
so I can start fishing
immediately
and see what killers
are in this area.
During the wet season,
this river is connected to the
place where the cowboys died,
so the monster could have
escaped into these waters.
I don't know yet
what could be down there,
so I have to be prepared
for anything.
This is actually a fish I bought
down at the market this morning.
It's just a tasty, scaly fish.
I'm just gonna cut the tail off
and use that, I think.
It's a big river, this,
and so what you're not doing
is casting at random,
because the fish won't be
distributed at random.
But what we've got here
is quite turbulent,
and it's also moving
back on itself near the banks,
so it's the kind of place
where food coming down the river
would settle,
and that's going to cause
the small fish to congregate,
and then
right on up the food chain.
It's up from the bottom.
It's not long
before I get my first bite.
Oop, I think
something's nibbling that.
[grunts]
Yep.
That's a piranha.
It's a black piranha.
The black piranha is the largest
of the piranha family...
growing up
to a foot and a half long.
A mouth full
of razor-sharp teeth
has given piranhas
a fearsome reputation,
and it's well earned.
Two years ago, I found a story
about a young boy
who was devoured by piranhas
in front of his grandparents.
[speaking native language]
All they got in was bones.
Wade:
It's unlikely that piranhas
would have killed
all three cowboys,
but I know from experience
that you've got to keep
an open mind,
only eliminating a suspect
after you've heard
all the evidence,
which is why I'm meeting
a witness tomorrow.
Before I track him down,
I'll see what other potential
suspects are here.
It must be a predators'
paradise down there.
Within minutes, something else
has grabbed my bait.
This feels much bigger
than a black piranha.
Gosh, this is strong.
This is strong.
It's rising up in the wa...
There it is!
Oh, it's a ray.
It's a ray.
Look at the size of that.
This is the first spotted
river ray I've ever caught.
I've come across stingrays
before.
In Thailand, I've seen how they
can seriously injure people.
[man screaming]
I want to take a closer look,
but I'm not sure how to safely
haul it into the boat.
My worry with this fish
is getting too close to it.
Oh.
[speaking foreign language]
[conversing in foreign language]
Its tail has a venomous spike
5 inches long,
which could whip 'round
and stab me as I pull it in.
Wade: Taking it to shore
and pulling it onto the bank
is the best option.
On close inspection,
I'm reminded
that this can kill, as well.
That spine there,
very dangerous.
It's just like a knife
5 inches long.
That would go in your flesh
very easily, be very painful,
and actually, if that's
in the wrong part of your body,
that could puncture an artery.
That could be fatal.
And these here... look at those.
They don't look very nice,
either.
Like piranha,
this is an unlikely suspect
for killing three people
at the same time,
but I'll need to hear
the witness's account
before I can take it
off the list.
I've arranged to meet him
near where the deaths occurred
just outside the small town
of El Dorado.
For the last leg of my journey,
I leave the boat behind
and drive cross-country.
I'm comfortable
in the Brazilian rainforest,
but this area
is unfamiliar to me,
and I'm not sure what to expect.
The whole area
was cleared decades ago
by ranchers
and gold prospectors.
All the wild animals
were chased out or killed,
making it safe
for livestock and humans.
But it seems
that a deadly water predator
has managed to cling on.
The cowboys' deaths are
still raw in the minds of many,
and I've been refused access
to where they died.
[conversing in foreign language]
I meet the witness, Jesunaldo,
at a nearby farm instead.
Okay.
[speaking native language]
He tells me that it happened
during the wet season
when the pastures were flooded.
A mule had become stuck
in the water.
Jesunaldo and five other
cowboys tried to rescue it.
What they had to do
was actually sort of go in
and just try and pull
the animal out.
The first three cowboys
went into the water.
Jesunaldo and the others
hung back.
[braying]
As the first horses got up
to their bellies,
something startled them.
[horse whinnies]
All three cowboys
were thrown into the water.
The others immediately got out
before it was too late.
- [speaking native language]
Wade: Mm. Mm.
I just asked why he didn't
just jump straight in
to try and help them,
and he said, ""Something told me
there was something
in the water.
It wasn't safe.
Didn't want to be number four...
The fourth victim.""
[speaking native language]
People who fell in the water
actually disappeared.
And we're talking water
that was...
It sounds like 3 or 4 feet deep.
[speaking native language]
Mmm.
I asked him what that
leaves him feeling like.
This was six years ago
that it happened,
and he said it's left
this sort of lingering sadness
from having lost his colleagues.
Jesunaldo's story
helps me eliminate
some potential suspects.
Piranhas can definitely
be taken off the list.
When piranhas attack, it's
an unmistakable feeding frenzy
with the water looking
as though it's boiling.
But Jesunaldo saw
only a calm surface.
[speaking foreign language]
Also from Jesunaldo's account,
stingrays can be struck off
the list.
If the cowboys had been
fatally stabbed by rays,
there would have been huge
amounts of blood in the water,
which he didn't see.
Jesunaldo has his own theory
about the killer's identity.
[speaking native language]
He's given me the name
of a terrifying, new suspect
for the cowboy killer.
It's a creature I've heard
about but never encountered.
Now, he says although he didn't
actually see anything,
I mean, he's pretty certain
that, you know,
this was electric eels
that caused
these three men to die.
I have a prime suspect...
A monster said to have
mythical powers
and one I always feared
I might encounter.
Now I have to try to catch one.
Known locally as poraque,
the electric eel
isn't actually an eel at all.
It's a member
of the knife fish family.
They can be found
throughout the Amazon
and Orinoco River basins.
They can grow
to over 8 feet long
and deliver a charge that's
enough to light up a house.
But is this enough to shock
a human being to death?
I've heard stories
about electric eels
killing people before,
but they've never been proven.
I've also heard of murderers
blaming electric eels
to cover their misdeeds.
But could an eel really kill
three people at one time?
I have my doubts.
There are many other animals
in these waters
that are documented killers,
such as anacondas and caimans.
Victims of these predators
bear the telltale marks
of bites or strangulation,
clues that help identify
the culprit.
A victim of electrocution
would have no such marks.
My job now is to find out
what state the cowboys' corpses
were in
when they were recovered.
To do this,
Jesunaldo has put me in contact
with a man called Hermes.
[speaking foreign language]
He discovered the bodies
the next day.
[speaking native language]
He tells me that the grim
search for the three bodies
started where the cowboys
disappeared.
[speaking native language]
They actually got boats
with motors in the water,
and they were driving those
around to create a disturbance.
The wash from the propellers
would churn up anything
lying below the surface.
[speaking native language]
There were no bite marks
or anything like that
on the bodies.
Having no bites is in line
with the prime suspect
being an electric eel.
And Hermes
has one final revelation
about the recovered bodies.
All three
had their hands clenched,
and inside the hands
were weed or grass
from the bottom of the water.
Clenched hands
are a telltale clue.
Wade: When a person receives
a large electric shock,
the body's muscles
begin to spasm,
which could explain
why the cowboys died
with their hands clenched.
This is all strong evidence
that an electric eel
might be responsible
for the cowboys' deaths.
But I wonder how much
real proof I'm going to find.
[electricity crackles]
I've got to catch one
and see for myself
what these fish are capable of.
Normally I can see
what I'm up against...
Massive teeth, cavernous mouths,
and tails
that can fatally stab you.
The electric eel's
invisible powers
make it unlike any fish
I've gone after before.
I'm hoping to gain
some local knowledge
at the town's fish market.
The people here
are those most likely
to have come up against them.
Everywhere I look
are toothy, dangerous fish.
But electric eels
aren't on the menu.
[speaking native language]
Fishermen don't fish
for them, and the reason
they don't fish for them
is that they say
the shock is very powerful.
Wade: Electric eels, or poraque,
have been striking fear
into people's hearts
since long before Europeans
arrived in the 16th century.
Before electricity
was understood,
Brazil's indigenous Tupi people
told of a warrior
who carelessly dropped
a lightning bolt on an eel,
giving the fish
its mysterious power.
Wade: In reality, it's the eel's
specially adapted muscles
that generate the large shocks.
But does this electricity
kill somebody outright,
or do they drown
after being paralyzed?
[speaking foreign language]
When I tell people
about my mission to catch one,
they're in no doubt
about what will happen to me,
one way or the other.
He says it will kill you,
no two ways about it.
- No.
- No?
Don't mess with it, basically.
Don't mess with it.
When I said,
""Is it strong enough to kill?""
he said, ""Yeah, absolutely.
No doubt about it.""
It's looking like
it could be a bit of a mission.
I would normally try to
apprehend my suspect
at the scene of the crime,
but quite apart from the ranch
owner's sensitivities,
I'm here at the height
of the dry season.
The water levels have dropped,
and the spot where the cowboys
died is now just pasture.
All the fish
are now concentrated
in the remaining water,
in theory, making them easier
to find.
It's possible that the monster
could have moved
into the nearest big river,
the Araguaia.
One thing is playing on my mind.
Since nobody fishes
for electric eels,
I haven't been able to get any
advice on how to catch them.
I've been warned they're elusive
and tend to show up
when least expected.
All I can realistically do
is put a bait in the water
and hope an electric eel takes
it before something else does.
The thing is there's loads
of predators in these waters,
so, you know, I've got a bait
on the bottom here,
but, you know,
there's lots of other species
that could pick it up.
You know, there's no way really
to single out the electric eel.
I know I'm doing the right thing
to catch one,
but something else
could beat it to the bait.
Because I don't want to get
a nasty shock
when I catch an electric eel,
I'm taking some precautions.
The nylon line I'm using
won't conduct electricity,
so I'll be safe
while bringing it in.
Then, once I get it to the boat,
I have a thick pair
of rubber boots and gloves,
which means
I'll be able to handle it
without getting shocked.
My theory that the fish
should be more concentrated
here seems to be correct,
as something takes my bait
within a matter of minutes.
Whoa.
There's something
on the end of my line,
and it's putting up
a powerful fight.
[chuckles]
I don't think
it's an electric eel.
It's too strong.
The back 4/5
of an electric eel's body
is mostly used
to produce electricity.
It doesn't have the muscle
to put up a struggle like this.
Ah, yeah.
You see the bubbles come out.
That's a big red-tail catfish.
Big red-tail catfish.
Out of the water,
it gulps in air,
blowing it out
through its gill flaps.
Got it.
Got it, got it, got it.
Very strong fish, but it tends
to not have the stamina.
But, I mean, another thing
to remark about this fish...
It's about 1/3 of the body
is his head.
Huge head.
[chuckles]
Look at this.
This river
is just full of predators.
There's a big chunk of fin
missing there.
I get the fish back in the water
so it can recover
before I let it go.
This proves my point...
What I was saying earlier on.
You throw a bit of dead fish
in this river,
and there's anything
that could take it, you know?
Could be an electric eel.
That's what I was hoping for.
But, you know,
it could just as likely be
one of these red-tail catfish.
That was a great catch,
but unfortunately,
it's not the fish I'm after.
I need to find out more
about electric eels...
Anything about them
which may help me catch one.
I'm meeting up
with a fish expert
from the University of Pará...
Dr. Jonathan Reddy.
He has a couple of specimens
in a tank,
so I can get my first proper
look at an electric eel.
These fish are using
their electric capability
all the time.
They're constantly sending out
little pulses.
Smaller eels like these
deliver a less-powerful shock
than the larger ones, but
they can still pack a punch.
Wearing protective
rubber gloves,
Jonathan shows me this
by hooking one up
to a bank of LEDs
[electricity crackles]
It lights them up using muscles
that have been modified
into thousands of special cells
which work in a similar way
to ""AA"" batteries.
Each individual cell generates
around 1/10 of a volt,
but when they all fire together,
a large pulse is produced.
It uses this high voltage
to shock prey and for defense.
So, this voltage is
just for a very short while...
400, 500 volts.
And the bigger eels...
They're known to be up to
600 volts, maybe even above.
That's almost the same
as the voltage
produced
by a heart defibrillator.
Electric eels also generate
a low-energy pulse
of around 10 volts
which they use to survey
their surroundings,
helping to compensate
for their poor eyesight.
It can see even in muddy water
by using its electroreceptors
to detect distortions
in its electrical field.
A pulse is emitted
every few seconds,
and these can be picked up by
placing electrodes in the water
and amplifying the signal.
There. You see?
A wave of signals
as they try and work out
what's going on.
[popping]
So, my finger in there
wouldn't feel this.
- It's only...
- You wouldn't feel this.
Small, orienting pulses
are harmless.
But the bigger shocks are
up to 65 times more powerful
and can travel through water.
When they're about
to stun something,
do you get much warning
if they're gonna do that?
- Yes.
Do I hear a...
You will get some kind
of warning,
but it might not be too much
for you to react in time.
[popping]
There you go.
No problems.
[chuckles]
No shock this time.
I'm hoping this equipment
will help me locate them
in the wild.
Wade: Electric eels
are proving to be very elusive,
and large rivers
have too many places to hide.
A farmer called Milton
knows the perfect place
where electric eels
could be trapped.
I'm going to fish in
a small lake which got cut off
when the water levels dropped
at the start of the dry season.
It's 3 miles inland
from the Araguaia,
so he gives me and my boat
a lift.
Electric eels come up for air
every 10 to 15 minutes.
They get 80% of their oxygen
by absorbing it through
blood vessels in the mouth.
If I pick up a signal and wait,
I'll know
I'm in the right position
to spot one
when it comes up to breathe.
Now, there was something
just surfaced...
Made some rings
just by that bit of wood there,
which could have been an
electric eel coming up for air.
I'm not hearing anything.
I've swept the entire lake
with no success.
Well, this equipment
worked very well in the tank,
but it's not really picking up
anything here
that I can recognize as being
definitely electric eel,
so I think I'm gonna return
to doing what I know best,
and that is getting
a line in the water.
Next to the lake
is a small pond.
Milton tells me it's full of
a toothy fish called trahira,
which he says is good for bait.
He gives me a bamboo rod to
catch them as the locals do.
Most fishing,
you're being quite stealthy.
You're creeping up.
You're putting the bait
in the water quietly.
Trahira are very inquisitive.
They lie in shallow water,
and if they hear a sound,
rather than head
in the opposite direction,
they actually come
and investigate.
Ah!
That's a trahira.
Those teeth are probably almost
as vicious as a piranha's.
It's a bit gap-toothed,
but those teeth are very sharp.
That's a start
towards getting some bait.
Unlike electric eels,
trahira are proving
incredibly easy to catch.
They're also very slippery.
It's like a bar of soap
with teeth.
Oh!
Progress stops when my hook
gets caught
on an underwater branch.
I'm not prepared for what I find
at the end of my snagged line.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[bleep]
But it's a case
of mistaken identity.
It's actually
not an electric eel.
That is an eel.
Wade: This is a masoom.
It may look like a true eel,
but it is, in fact,
another elongated fish.
For a moment there,
I was worried.
I saw this long, snakelike thing
on the line,
and I wasn't hanging around
to have a close look.
I was out of the water.
If this was an electric eel
this size,
that could be potentially fatal.
Strange sort of admission
to make.
I'm actually glad that wasn't
the fish that I was after.
I'm not having much luck
catching an electric eel.
It's proving far harder
to find than I expected.
But I've gotten word
of another attack,
and I'm heading out
to investigate.
It happened in 2007
on a farm near Vila Nova,
where a 21-year-old farm worker
called Francisco
died in a small pond.
I've traveled there to meet up
with his friend, Fernando,
the only witness
to Francisco's last moments.
[speaking native language]
Francisco had only been working
at the farm for two weeks
when he decided to go fishing
in a nearby pond.
[conversing in native language]
Fernando warned him about the
electric eels he'd seen there,
but Francisco carried on anyway.
They were fishing
with a sort of basket.
You go in the water,
and you run this
along the bottom of the pond,
and then you see if you got
any fish in the basket.
[speaking native language]
And he said, you know,
they tried a couple of times.
Hadn't caught anything.
Fernando was staying
on the bank.
He didn't want to get
in the water.
On the third scoop
of the basket...
Francisco disappeared.
And, so what he did...
He ran for help,
came back with two other people,
and when they got there,
there was no sign of anybody,
no sign of Francisco.
They started searching
for his body
by dragging a wooden hoe
through the water.
[speaking foreign language]
Eventually, Francisco's body
rose to the surface
with a macabre addition.
[speaking native language]
The body of the eel was wrapped
around the boy's body.
Only when it was pulled
right into the shallows
did it actually then disappear
back into the water.
Now Fernando's saying that, like
me, you know, he'd heard stories
that this is a fish that's
capable of killing people,
but he didn't
really believe that,
hadn't heard
anything very definite,
and so when he saw
what actually did happen,
he said
he almost didn't believe it.
I've never heard of a situation
of someone being killed
by a fish
in such a small volume of water.
But the other thing
that really struck me
was that unlike the case of the
three cowboys who were killed...
I mean, here there was
absolutely no doubt
what animal was responsible.
There was a 100% positive I.D.
You know, this was an electric
eel that killed Francisco.
Finally, clear evidence
of an electric eel
causing a human death.
What I don't know, though,
is whether victims drown
after being shocked
or die from electrocution.
I've tracked down
Dr. Evo Panovich,
the pathologist who performed
Francisco's autopsy.
[Wade speaking foreign language]
[speaking native language]
So, I just asked Dr. Panovich
a simple question...
Is the electric eel capable
of killing a human being?
And the answer...
A very clear yes.
He goes on to tell me
exactly how Francisco died.
[speaking foreign language]
It sounds like it was actually
really... the heart was stopped.
So, instead of actually
contracting strongly
to circulate the blood,
it had gone into some kind
of fibrillation.
In that kind of situation,
you know,
drowning is almost secondary.
The immediate cause of the death
was the electricity of the fish.
This is exactly the evidence
I've been searching for.
There's only one thing
left to do...
Catch the culprit without
ending up on Dr. Evo's slab.
The locals tell me
electric eels lurk here.
I'm wearing
my protective rubber boots,
and the rubber gloves are on
standby in case I catch one.
I've just seen
something surface.
I've also ditched
my carbon-fiber rod
in favor of a bamboo pole...
Perfect for small ponds
like this
and with the added advantage
that it won't conduct
electricity.
It's trahira.
Whoops.
Once again, aggressive trahira
are proving no problem to catch.
Actually thought that might have
been an electric eel
because the take was not
characteristic of trahira.
Trahira makes a very sort
of jagged, quick take.
That was quite fiddly,
and the line going out slowly,
so I thought it might have been
an electric eel,
but another trahira.
Wade: I'm becoming
increasingly frustrated...
because the final question
still lingers...
Is one eel capable
of killing three men?
[horse whinnies]
Little is known
about electric-eel behavior,
so just seeing one in the wild,
never mind catching one,
might help me answer
this last question.
I know now
that this is an animal
that's capable
of killing people.
It's got nothing to fear
from other animals,
and at times it certainly seems
to be pretty bold,
but, you know, where are they?
I think, you know,
I've got to give this
some real serious thought
about what I do now
if I'm actually to succeed
in catching one of these things.
The electric eel's elusiveness
isn't the only thing
going against me.
[thunder crashes]
It was on a night like this
when, according to Tupi legend,
the ancestral electric eel
received its heaven-sent powers
when a lightning bolt
was dropped on it.
But the rain that's falling
for the first time in months
is about to make my job
much harder.
Soon the eels
will no longer be concentrated
in the shallow dry-season ponds.
[thunder rumbles]
I was getting close, but with
this, you know, it could mean
that my window of opportunity
is rapidly closing.
It could actually be too late.
This could ruin it.
This could mean that I actually
don't find my electric eel.
The water is rising,
and all the small ponds
and waterways
are starting to link up again,
allowing the eels to disperse.
This makes
an already elusive creature
nearly impossible to find.
My best option is to travel east
to where the rains
haven't yet hit.
I fish as I go,
but I'm still catching
everything but an electric eel.
This is a thing
called a fidalgo.
It's a type of catfish.
Not an electric eel.
My last hope is an area
just southwest of Maraba,
where it's still tinder dry and
fires are burning everywhere.
The water here
is at its absolute lowest.
And at daybreak, I'll have the
best chance I'm going to get
before the rains sweep in.
After asking around,
I get a promising lead
about a tiny pool right in
the middle of cattle pasture.
[conversing in foreign language]
It's more like a mud puddle...
The last place I'd expect
to find a river monster.
[speaking foreign language]
Finally, after 10 days
of searching,
a giant electric eel
is right in front of me.
That looked like
just one of these branches,
one of these roots.
That is an electric eel.
It's a big one.
Now I've got to work up
the nerve to catch it.
I'm just making
a bit of a trench.
From my point of view,
it'll be easier to handle
if there's some kind of
sort of notch that it's in
rather than
its being able to slip
and slide all over the place.
My normal capture method
would be useless
in water this shallow,
so out goes the rod
and in comes a lasso...
Fitting for cowboy country.
Because electric eels don't
rely on physical strength,
pulling it out of the water
shouldn't be that hard.
But not getting shocked will be,
so protective clothing
is essential.
We've got a plan.
The plan is not so much
to sort of go after the head
with the noose,
but to position that and then
get it to go through the noose.
Just taking a few deep breaths
because one slip
and, you know,
it could be very nasty, indeed.
Need to be so focused
and so careful about this.
An eel this size can deliver
a shock of 650 volts.
That's enough to stop my heart
in seconds.
First go! Amazing!
First go!
Electric eels can keep on
shocking out of water,
but the rubber gloves we're
wearing protect us from this.
Look at the colors
on this thing.
These are...
I got to get it clean.
That is... it's doing - it looks
like a muscle contraction...
Spasm, almost... and that's
when it's actually shocking.
Wade: Because electric eels
get most of their oxygen
from breathing air,
they can stay out of water
for long periods of time.
That's 5'10 1/2"".
That's pretty much
exactly the same as me.
This is exactly the same size
as the eel
that killed Francisco,
the 21-year-old man who died
in a tiny pond near Vila Nova.
Wade: If I wasn't wearing
these rubber gloves,
I could be dead, too.
It's over 100 degrees,
and I don't want the fish
to overheat,
so time it went
back in the water.
Whoa.
The pond may be shallow
at the moment,
but the rains
are not far behind me.
The waters will soon rise,
giving this eel the freedom
to roam once again.
My search led me
to this tiny, drying-out puddle.
I mean, the water in there
is barely 6 inches deep.
It's the last place you'd expect
to find a river monster,
but that's where it was.
[man speaking native language]
There's more.
There's more.
There's more.
It's not just this big one.
There's...
Again, it looks like wood,
but it's started moving.
We're watching it,
and it looks like there's
actually several, but smaller,
right in with these roots here.
I've just never seen
anything like this before.
It's like a tangle of bodies.
I'm just trying to count
the heads.
The more I look, the more I see.
I was thinking 10 or a dozen.
I think there could be 20
down here.
This is an incredible discovery
and answers the final question
about how the cowboys died.
Wade: I believe a group
of electric eels like this
was trapped in a pool
over the dry season.
When the rains came,
the water levels got higher,
until the eels could all leave
into the swelling waterways.
It was in these waterways where
the trio of unlucky cowboys
came across them...
after their startled horses
threw them into the water.
Each one of these eels
could deliver a fatal shock,
so a group of 20
would easily be capable
of killing the cowboys.
This journey has once again
proved to me
that there's no end
to lethal river monsters
and that they can be found
anywhere.
Who knows
where I'll find one next?"," Electrophorus electricus is the best-known species of electric eel. It is a South American electric fish. Until the discovery of two additional species in 2019, the genus was classified as the monotypic, with this species the only one in the genus.[3] Despite the name, it is not an eel, but rather a knifefish.[4] It is considered as a freshwater teleost which contains an electrogenic tissue that produces electric discharges.[5]

Taxonomic history The species has been reclassified several times. When originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766, he used the name Gymnotus electricus, placing it in the same genus as Gymnotus carapo (banded knifefish) which he had described several years earlier. It was only about a century later, in 1864, that the electric eel was moved to its own genus Electrophorus by Theodore Gill.[6]

In September 2019, David de Santana et al. suggested the division of the genus into three species based on DNA divergence, ecology and habitat, anatomy and physiology, and electrical ability: E. electricus, E. voltai sp. nov., and E. varii sp. nov. The study found E. electricus to be the sister species to E. voltai, with both species diverging during the Pliocene.[3]

Anatomy

Comparison of the three species of Electrophorus E. electricus has an elongated, cylindrical body, typically growing to about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, and 20 kg (44 lb) in weight.[7] Their coloration is dark gray-brown on the back and yellow or orange on the belly. Mature females have a darker abdomen. They have no scales. The mouth is square and positioned at the end of the snout. The anal fin extends the length of the body to the tip of the tail. As in other ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The anterior chamber is connected to the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish's buoyancy.

E. electricus has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its buccal cavity.[8] As obligate air-breathers, E. electricus must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.[9]

Physiology Further information: Electric eel § Electrophysiology E. electricus has three pairs of abdominal organs that produce electricity: the main organ, Hunter's organ, and Sachs' organ. These organs occupy a large part of its body, and give the electric eel the ability to generate two types of electric organ discharges: low voltage and high voltage. These organs are made of electrocytes, lined up so a current of ions can flow through them and stacked so each one adds to a potential difference.[10] The three electrical organs are developed from muscle and exhibit several biochemical properties and morphological features of the muscle sarcolemma; they are found symmetrically along both sides of the eel.[5]

When the eel finds its prey, the brain sends a signal through the nervous system to the electrocytes. This opens the ion channels, allowing sodium to flow through, reversing the polarity momentarily. By causing a sudden difference in electric potential, it generates an electric current in a manner similar to a battery, in which stacked plates each produce an electric potential difference.[10] Electric eels are also capable of controlling their prey's nervous systems with their electrical abilities; by controlling their victim's nervous system and muscles via electrical pulses, they can keep prey from escaping or force it to move so they can locate its position.[11][12]

Electric eels use electricity in multiple ways. Low voltages are used to sense the surrounding environment. High voltages are used to detect prey and, separately, stun them, at which point the electric eel applies a suction-feeding bite.[13]

Anatomy of an electric eel's electric organs Sachs' organ is associated with electrolocation. Inside the organ are many muscle-like cells, called electrocytes. Each cell produces 0.15 V, the cells being stacked in series to enable the organ to generate nearly 10 V at around 25 Hz in frequency. These signals are emitted by the main organ; Hunter's organ can emit signals at rates of several hundred hertz.[14]

There are several physiological differences among the three electric organs, which allow them to have very different functions. The main electrical organ and the strong-voltage section of Hunter's organ are rich in calmodulin, a protein that is involved in high-voltage production.[15] Additionally, the three organs have varying amounts of Na+/K+-ATPase, which is a Na+/K+ ion pump that is crucial in the formation of voltage. The main and Hunter's organs have a high expression of this protein, giving it a high sensitivity to changes in ion concentration, whereas Sachs' organ has a low expression of this protein.[16]

The typical output is sufficient to stun or deter virtually any animal. The eels can vary the intensity of the electric discharge, using lower discharges for hunting and higher intensities for stunning prey or defending themselves. They can also concentrate the discharge by curling up and making contact at two points along its body.[17] When agitated, they can produce these intermittent electric shocks over at least an hour without tiring.[citation needed]

E. electricus also possesses high frequency–sensitive tuberous receptors, which are distributed in patches over its body. This feature is apparently useful for hunting other Gymnotiformes.[14] E. electricus has been prominent in the study of bioelectricity since the 18th century.[18] The species is of some interest to researchers, who make use of its acetylcholinesterase and adenosine triphosphate.[19][20]

Despite being the first described species in the genus and thus the most famous example, E. electricus actually has the weakest maximum voltage of the three species in the genus, at only 480 volts (as opposed to 572 volts in E. varii and 860 volts in E. voltai).[3]

Ecology and life history

Electric eel at the New England Aquarium Habitat E. electricus is restricted to freshwater habitats in the Guiana Shield. Populations in the Amazon basin, Brazilian Shield, and other parts of the Guiana Shield are now thought to belong to E. varii and E. voltai.[21]

Feeding ecology E. electricus feeds on invertebrates, although adult eels may also consume fish and small mammals, such as rats. First-born hatchlings eat other eggs and embryos from later clutches.[14] The juveniles eat invertebrates, such as shrimp and crabs.

Reproduction E. electricus is known for its unusual breeding behavior. In the dry season, a male eel makes a nest from his saliva into which the female lays her eggs. As many as 3,000 young hatch from the eggs in one nest. Males grow to be larger than females[22][23] by about 35 cm (14 in).

More on author: Linnaeus . Issue If confirmed as having been actually made available before Gymnotus electricus Linnaeus (1766), Gymnotus tremulus Houttuyn (1764) should be regarded as the senior synonym. However, following Articles 23.9.1 and 23.9.2 of the Code (ICZN, 1999), Gymnotus electricus must be regarded as the valid name, and qualified as a nomen protectum, and Gymnotus tremulus as a nomen oblitum. It seems that both Houttuyn’s (1764) and Linnaeus’ (1766) descriptions were based on previous descriptions by other authors (i.e., primarily, Gronovius and Seba), and that no specimens were actually examined by these authors regarding their proposals of new species. Gronovius’ specimen (or specimens) is currently probably lost, but Seba’s specimen (which apparently have come from the Essequibo river; Seba, 1758, III, p.108, pl. 34, fig. 6) is probably housed in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden (Netherlands). That should, then, be considered the remaining name-bearing type for both species above (ICZN, 1999, Article 72.5.6).

Low voltage EOD 2.03-2.19 ms duration; high-voltage EOD 480 V at 760mm TL (Ref. 120918 ). Body shape ( shape guide ): elongated; Cross section: oval. Biology Glossary (e.g.  epibenthic) Prefer muddy bottoms and calm waters; frequently found in coastal plains, swamps and creeks but is also found inland where a favorable biotope exist.  Juveniles feed on invertebrates, adults feed on fish and small mammals (Ref. 12225 ), first-born larvae prey on other eggs and embryos coming from late spawning batches (Ref. 40645 ).  The electric organ of this species consists of flattened electrocytes, numbering to about hundreds of thousands, connected in series (Ref. 10840 ; 10011 ).  Generates two type of electric organ discharges (EODs) from different electric organs which are of myogenic derivation:  1) low-voltage EODs (about 10 V) emitted by the Sach's organ at rates of up to 25 Hz, and 2) high-voltage EODs (about 50-fold) emitted by the main and Hunter's organs at peak rates of up to several hundred Hz.  Low-voltage EOD has been associated with electro location whereas high-voltage EOD has been noted during predatory attacks (Ref. 10011 ).  An EOD of 500 V was recorded from a 1 m specimen (Ref. 10530 ), making it a potentially dangerous species.  Incorporation of this species in fish-based house security systems has been suggested (see Ref. 9506 ).  Also possesses high-frequency sensitive tuberous receptors patchily distributed over the body that seems useful for hunting other gymnotiforms (Ref. 10583 ).  A nocturnal species; captive specimens showed higher low-voltage EOD activity during the night compared to daytime (Ref. 10011 ).  This cycle seems to be free-running (internally controlled) (Ref. 10829 ).  Probably a fractional spawner; fecundity count was17,000 eggs (Ref. 10630 ).  An obligatory air breather (Ref. 10011 ) and can withstand poorly oxygenated water (Ref. 26457 ).  Used in experimental studies. Life cycle and mating behavior Maturity | Reproduction | Spawning | Eggs | Fecundity | Larvae Males construct foam nests and guard the growing larvae until mid-January when the first seasonal rains flood the breeding area, causing the about 10 cm long young eels to disperse (Ref. 40645 ).
Males outnumber females (3:1) and are considerably larger than females (Ref. 40645 ).
There are three successive batches of eggs deposited in a spawning period. Not all eels with fully developed gonads (in Goiapi drainnage) participated in the annual spawning activity suggesting that mating success depends in part on finding suitable breeding sites (Ref. 40645 ).

Flesh Ripper,New Zealand Longfin Eel,Anguilla dieffenbachii,"My name's Jeremy Wade.
For 25 years,
I've chased dangerous fish
up some of the wildest rivers
on the planet,
tracking down the facts
that lie behind legends.
I'm fascinated
by the real-life monsters
that sometimes eat us...
and which feed on nightmares.
But as a biologist,
I want to know the truth.
Now I'm back on the hunt,
lured by the riddle
of an 8-foot flesh-eater
that's said to devour humans.
If I'm right,
this alleged killer
is born deep in the ocean...
Yet transforms itself
into a freshwater predator.
The fish I'm after
has a grip like a vise,
and it stands accused
of terrifying attacks.
[screams]
Wade:
Imagine a land mass cut off
from the rest of the world
for 80 million years...
A wilderness
of impenetrable forests
and lakes almost twice as deep
as Loch Ness.
Now suppose
that in the cold, dark waters
of this lost world
lurks a predator big enough
to kill a man.
This was virtually
the last place on Earth
to be discovered.
When the Maori came here
barely 800 years ago,
there was one animal
they revered above all others.
I've always thought
of New Zealand
as a totally safe place
to get in the water,
but just recently, two separate
reports have caught my eye
and made me think again.
One incident concerns
a young man, Clint Haines,
who was out on a remote lake
in New Zealand's South Island.
According
to this newspaper report,
Haines had gone out to recover
a friend's boat propeller
from the bottom of the lake.
He knew the lake well,
or at least he thought he did.
At about 100 feet down,
something massive
suddenly swam towards him.
And within seconds,
there were more of them,
he says up to about 80 pounds
in size.
In the pitch black,
one of these creatures
sank its jaws
into one of Clint's fins
and started to drag him down.
Wade: Panicking,
he dropped his flashlight
and swam for his life.
[screaming]
Clint's wife, Bev, remembers
how this aggressive pack
actually pursued him
to the surface,
where Clint was screaming
to get out.
He'd come up so fast
from deep water
that he collapsed
with the bends.
Haines survived the attack
but was plagued by nightmares.
Wade: For Ian Sutherland,
another diver working
in northern New Zealand,
a similar encounter
proved to be more violent.
The creature in this case
was already a local legend.
Its head was reportedly
a foot across.
Without warning,
it rammed Ian in the chest
with enough force
to crack one of his ribs.
By all accounts,
the animals that grabbed
and thumped these two divers
were supersized eels.
Now, I've heard about
monstrous sea-dwelling eels.
Some, like this European conger,
can grow to 10 feet long,
and the giant moray is
a seriously large animal,
certainly big enough
to attack humans.
One well-known account here
of a diver getting his thumb
ripped off and eaten.
But the idea
that a freshwater eel
could ever be huge or dangerous
comes as a real surprise.
Wade:
New Zealand, in fact, has
three kinds of freshwater eel.
The speckled eel grows
to around 6 feet long,
but it's off my suspect list
because it doesn't live
in the lake
where Haines was attacked.
At little more than 4 feet long,
the shortfin eel is simply
too small to fit the bill.
The most likely perpetrator
is the longfin,
an eel that's unique
to New Zealand
and which is known to grow
to at least 6 feet.
Modern records
have this snakelike fish
growing to around 55 pounds,
but there are older
anecdotal reports
of much larger specimens.
In the 19th century,
the naturalist Thomas Potts
mentions a 90-pounder landed
from a place called Stonyhurst.
And there's even a story
of a 130-pound eel
taken from a deep lake
in New Zealand's South Island.
Such an eel, if it ever existed,
must have looked like
an underwater python.
Wade: These accounts
are certainly intriguing,
but buried in the archives
of London's Maritime Museum
is an even more tantalizing
description
of a creature
that's not only a monster
but also a man-eater.
Some 240 years ago,
British explorer James Cook
painstakingly mapped
the coastline of New Zealand.
As he did so,
he gathered information
from the Maori inhabitants
about native wildlife.
And in one of his many journals,
he alludes very specifically
to a man-eating monster.
Following a conversation
with the local chief,
Cook writes, and I quote,
""We had another piece
of information
importing that there are here
snakes and lizards
of an enormous size...
8 feet long
and equal to a man's body
in circumference.
They sometimes seize
and devour men.""
According to Cook,
the chief actually
drew a picture
of one of these creatures
to show what he meant,
but the obvious conclusion
that this beast must be a python
or possibly some kind
of huge lizard
simply can't be right.
What makes this account
so intriguing
and also so problematic
is that there are no snakes
or any large reptiles
in New Zealand,
and there never have been.
Wade:
As I head for New Zealand,
my prime suspect for
Captain Cook's devourer of men
is not a snake
but a fish
that looks like a snake.
It's a theory
that seems more plausible
when you consider
Maori folklore.
Maori legends are full of tales
about predatory beasts
called taniwha.
Now, these potentially
very dangerous creatures
are quite slippery customers,
and sometimes they take
the form of a giant eel.
Wade: I'm starting my search
for a giant longfin
at a place called
Mangawhitikau, near Waitomo,
on New Zealand's north island.
Supposedly, there are eels
that have lived in this cave
for at least 30 years
and have never seen daylight.
More disconcertingly, the Maori
name for this underworld
means ""bad place
to cross the river.""
Eels are at the heart
of Maori culture.
Legend has it
that they all sprang
from a single huge ancestor.
The story goes that there was
a drought up in heaven,
and a giant eel
was sent down to Earth
to try and find water
for the gods.
But while it was here,
it tried to seduce
the wife of Maui,
who was the most powerful
of the Maori gods,
and, enraged,
Maui fought with the giant eel
and hacked it in two,
and the severed head
gave rise to all
the seawater eels,
and the tail, so the story goes,
gave rise
to all the freshwater eels.
Wade: Even with a flashlight
and a head lamp,
I'm straining to see
more than a few feet.
I've no idea
what might be lurking here,
but to tempt something
out of the shadows,
I decide to dip a piece of meat
into the water.
Straightaway, an eel emerges.
This one isn't huge,
but it is surprisingly bold.
Despite living in pitch black,
it has absolutely no fear
of the light or of me.
It's on a single-minded search
for flesh.
Yet this carnivorous instinct
doesn't, on its own,
make the longfin a killer.
I want to find out
if they can get big enough
and aggressive enough
to be seriously dangerous
to people.
Could they ever be,
in the words of Cook,
devourers of men?
To get a proper look
at what makes the longfin eel
New Zealand's
top freshwater predator,
I first have to catch one.
When it comes to bait,
anything goes.
Fresh roadkill
could be worth a try.
Eels tend to be
more active at night,
relying on smell
rather than sight to find food.
I use a concoction of guts
and offal to draw them in.
Eels have a phenomenal ability
to sense blood.
My two rods are each equipped
with an electronic alarm
primed to go off if something
makes a grab for the bait.
[beeping]
I don't have to wait long.
If there's flesh on offer,
it seems these animals are
into it like starved piranhas.
Wade: Even with a small one,
I have to take special care,
because these fish
have poisonous blood.
The serum contains a neurotoxin
that can kill dogs,
and just a splash
into my eye or a cut
as I try to unhook it
could land me
in serious trouble.
Doesn't feel like
a normal fish at all...
Very, very smooth skin.
They do actually have scales,
but they're embedded
under her layer of skin.
Not very big eyes... they don't
really use their eyes to hunt.
But they do use smell,
and you can see
what looks like a pair of horns
on the front of the head there.
In fact,
these structures are tubes
that funnel water
into enlarged nasal chambers.
The eel's sense of smell
is even more sensitive
than that
of a great white shark.
Having zeroed in,
an eel grabs its prey
with powerful jaws that bristle
with hundreds of teeth.
You can see why people
consider these to be
very similar to snakes,
even though they are
technically fish.
There are plenty of eels here
but nothing over 3 feet long.
Leaving legends aside,
I wonder if science
can shed any light
on the question of size.
Just how big, in theory,
could this animal grow?
Wade:
Inside the skull of a dead eel
may seem like a strange place
to look for an answer,
but Dr. Don Jellyman
is the world authority
in these animals,
and he knows
exactly what he's after.
So, this is the brain,
the spinal cord,
and this little item that
sits in a small sac just
in the back here
and is part
of the balancing system...
So that's what we're after,
Jeremy...
That little bone here
holds the key
to a lot of the life history
of the eel,
its age, its growth rate.
Once magnified,
this tiny ear bone
reveals the growth history
of the fish.
So, is that the same
sort of principle
as counting the rings on a tree,
something like that?
It is.
It's exactly the same.
A 2-to 3-foot eel
can be 30 years old,
but amazingly,
this is just a youngster.
What's the oldest they might be,
do you think?
Any conjectures?
Well, the oldest that I've aged
is 105 years old,
and from that lake,
the average age at which
the females migrated
was 93 years.
It's extraordinary, isn't it?
One thing I've been
thinking about
is this mention
in Captain Cook's journals
about... he was told
about something
that was snakelike
and 8 feet long.
Would one of these be capable
of growing to 8 feet,
do you think,
in ideal conditions?
It's quite likely, in the wild,
that they would have grown
to a very, very large size
like that.
So that could be
a reliable report,
and at that length, how much
is that gonna weigh, roughly?
Well over 100 pounds
at that stage, yeah, yeah.
Gosh.
- That's a big fish.
- Yeah.
It's a seriously big fish.
So that Captain Cook
report... it could have
been one of these.
It could well have been.
It might be of interest
just to have a look inside it,
so we'll just...
Do a run up through here.
So, ooh, there is
something in here.
- That's the stomach there.
- That's quite full, isn't it?
Let's take a peek.
I'm rather interested to know
what this has got in it.
With toxic blood
oozing out of the eel's body,
I'm careful to wash my hands.
Um, so...
Aha.
Is that another eel?
It's another eel, yes.
It's well-digested.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so they can be
quite cannibalistic.
They're just well-adapted
to taking those opportunities
as they arise.
If there's tucker there,
they're into it, yeah.
Wade: My photo fit
of Captain Cook's monster
is starting to take shape.
It's a fish with real nerve...
Guided by the nose
of a bloodhound...
And armed with hundreds
of close-packed teeth.
It can live
for more than a century
and potentially at least
grow to 8 feet long.
It also happens
to have toxic blood
and a taste for its own kind.
But is it truly dangerous?
To find out, I've booked myself
onto a popular radio chat show.
Man:
Radio Southland, 96.4 FM.
I'm talking with well-known
angler Jeremy Wade,
who's really interested
in hearing your stories
about longfin eels.
So, give us a call on...
I'm looking for evidence
of aggression,
and the lines are soon buzzing.
Man #2: An eel came and
latched on to the deer carcass,
and we had a wrestling match
for that.
Man #3: She latched on
to my finger.
Man #4: When I looked down,
I had quite a surprise.
Quite a large black eel.
Man #5: It would have to
have been, you know, 2 meters
and as round as a man's thigh.
Man #6: my finger and then
stripped back to the bone.
Man #7: There are some monsters.
There's no question of that.
I was prepared for tales
of ducklings swallowed whole,
but it seems that some eels
strike at much larger prey.
Woman: Yeah, I took my dog Sam
down to the river,
and we were playing with a ball.
I was throwing it, and he
was bringing it back to me.
And I threw it this one time,
and I heard him go in for it.
I could hear something going on,
but I couldn't see him.
[ducklings chirping]
He just disappeared
under the water.
Wade: I'm still taking note
when a man calls in
to tell me about some sheep
that were eaten alive.
[sheep bleating]
Then, to top it all,
the story of a man
who went skinny dipping.
Wade: Right.
I get your drift.
So this chap
who was hospitalized,
was he missing anything
when he got out of hospital?
[chuckling] Okay.
Wade:
My respect for these longfins
is growing by the minute,
so I'll definitely take care
when I'm out there
trying to get my own
hands-on experience.
Man #8: Beware.
Just be careful.
Eel wrestling is not
a good sport for tourists.
Okay, thanks for the warning.
Stick to bungee jumping.
Wade:
Going on the radio
has really helped me
to tap into local knowledge
and very quickly
get an accurate sense
of what this predator
is capable of.
But since coming here,
I've also tracked down
an old newspaper report
that describes a terrifying
assault on a young girl.
This appears to be
a very clear example
of an eel deliberately trying
to kill a human.
Wade: In 1971,
8-year-old Carol Davis
wandered into a stream
on her father's property.
For several days previously,
large eels had been attacking
Mr. Davis's ducks.
Then, for reasons
that aren't clear,
one of them decided
to have a go at Carol.
[screaming]
The idea that an eel could
drag a girl into deep water
is entirely possible.
This is a fish that can
actually swim backwards
with real power.
Carol's horror story has
really concentrated my mind.
Not only was she attacked
in shallow water,
her ordeal also happened
in broad daylight.
It makes me wonder
what would happen to me
under similar conditions.
It's not just
dark underground caves
where you find eels lurking.
I'm in a wildlife park
where I know there are
half a dozen big longfins.
I'm not yet ready
to try this out in the wild,
where, if things went wrong,
I'd be miles from any help.
Nonetheless, there's
no such thing as a tame eel,
and I've already heard enough
to put me on edge.
Their mouths are lined
with hundreds
of backward-pointing teeth,
and the ones in here
are certainly big enough
to grab an ankle or a hand.
Aah!
I'm treading
in sort of roots here.
The trouble is, they're gonna be
lurking right in there.
I don't want to
get my toes nipped.
After a couple
of nervy encounters,
I decide to push my luck.
I've actually got one
right here.
There we go.
Whew!
Short and dramatic.
That's my first real contact
with one of these
big longfin eels.
Clearly, well-fed eels like
these just aren't aggressive,
but I'm not fooling myself
they'll be so placid
in the wild.
In New Zealand's South Island,
I leave the beaten track
and push into the mountains.
Some of the biggest eels
mentioned in historical records
were caught from deep lakes
in the interior,
and this is where I'm focusing
my search for a monster.
Wade: On Lake Manapouri,
in what feels like
the middle of nowhere,
I first join Evan Brunton,
a man who tracks
and catches eels for a living.
There are parts of this lake
that plunge to more
than a quarter of a mile deep,
room enough for a monster
to hide in, even today.
Wade: So we've actually got
over 1,500 feet in the middle.
I mean, that's way deeper
than Loch Ness.
Brunton: 1,500 feet's
nothing for an eel.
The other night,
we were tracking eels
at 2:00 in the morning,
and one eel was traveling
right on the surface,
and the other eel was
traveling at 150 meters,
which is 600 feet.
An eel could quite happily live
at the bottom of this lake.
And do you think there are
still big ones around?
Yes, there is a few big ones
from time to time,
just seem to turn up
out of the blue.
Evan calculates that some
of the eels in this lake
are over 80 years old.
When you think about it,
some of these eels
were 20 years old
at the outbreak
of the Second World War.
Have you heard any stories
of aggressive or dangerous eels
in your time?
A couple of people went missing
in the Hidden Lakes of Tianya,
supposedly taken
by monstrous eels.
You've only got to see
the strength in them
when they fight.
It'd be very, very hard
for some people
to actually get up again,
especially if there was
more than one of them.
People can fall over and knock
themselves out, can't they?
Wade: At a secluded bay,
we pull over to see
if anything large
has turned up in Evan's nets.
Even here, the chances of
finding a giant eel are slim,
but the 16-pounder
that Evan hauls out
is still an impressive animal.
So powerful.
You can imagine
that a 30-pound...
Could drag someone away.
There's some eels
up in the [speaks indistinctly]
that have been up to 100 pound.
And they've been caught
and reliably weighed?
- Yes, they have.
- Gosh.
Wade: Evan's accounts
of monstrous 100-pound eels
have got me itching to fish.
But first,
there's a niggling question
at the back of my mind.
I can well believe
that a massive eel
could seize someone
and drag them under,
but with teeth designed
to grip rather than cut,
I'm skeptical about
whether it could actually
dismember and devour a person.
If Captain Cook's man-eater
really is a huge longfin,
then this animal must have some
other way to rip you apart.
To see how,
I'm laying on a buffet.
A hunter has provided me
with a deer carcass,
and I've brought along
a high-tech box of tricks.
Underwater cameras
placed around the bait
will give me separate views of
the tail, throat, and stomach.
If any eels show up to feed,
I'll be able to see
how they deal with something
that's too large
to swallow whole.
The eels I've seen
got very powerful bodies
and a very strong grip,
but how one of these animals,
even if it was the 8-foot size
mentioned
in Captain Cook's journal...
How that could devour a person
is still not
immediately obvious.
With my surveillance cameras
switched on,
I retreat
to a makeshift control room.
The stage is set.
All I can do now
is sit and wait.
For nearly two hours,
nothing shows up.
If eels are sensitive to
electricity then it could be
that my cameras
are spooking them.
Or perhaps they're just
biding their time until dark.
Suddenly they appear
out of nowhere.
And like a pack of wolves they
start to attack the carcass.
Straining to see
in the pitch black,
I catch my first glimpse
of how these predators
could rip you to shreds.
Here we go.
It's getting in there.
Yep, it's latching on.
It's actually spinning.
It's spinning around.
These eels are feeding
like crocodiles,
gripping the victim firmly
then spinning violently
to twist off chunks of flesh.
It actually reminds me
of this story that I've heard.
It's one of those stories
that I haven't been able to pin
down where it happened, who to,
but a few people
have told me this.
Somebody who was driving,
supposedly had a few to drink...
[hard rock music playing]
Wade: It's said that the man
swerved out of control
and crashed into a lake.
[tires screech]
Unconscious and bleeding,
he would have been,
quite literally,
a sitting target
for marauding eels.
I've now seen with my own eyes
how a pack of longfins
could make a real mess
of someone,
given half a chance.
I've also tracked down credible
stories of massive eels
living in New Zealand's
remote backwaters,
yet, just when I'm ready
to try and catch
one of these slippery monsters,
I run into
an unexpected problem.
In wilderness areas like this,
fishing for eels with hooks
is now strictly forbidden.
I've no choice but to give up
my usual methods
and start from scratch.
Eel fisherman Vic Thompson
is my teacher.
I'm gonna make a bob for you.
Simply find a bit of steak
like that
or a bit of any red meat
and cut it into a slim slice,
and I've got a bit
of mackerel fish here,
which adds a bit of flavor.
You have a bit of wool,
just ordinary
darning wool needle.
Thread through like that
to start with.
Pull it right through.
And then you just wind
this around like that.
After you've done
the first layer like that,
you've got to put a loop on here
to attach it to your line.
The theory is simple.
When the eel bites, its teeth
get tangled in the wool.
I must then drag it ashore
before it shakes itself free.
So, there you've got
your loop on your bob.
Good bite size for an eel.
I guess the angler
doesn't have...
The eel actually has the hook
in this situation.
The eel has a lot of hooks
in its mouth.
So they hook onto the wool.
Very low-tech, but very
effective, by the sound of it.
Very effective.
Wade:
It all sounds straightforward,
but as I head for a deserted
spot in a deep water lake,
I'm not so sure.
The method I've just learned is
a traditional Maori technique
known as toy, or bobbing.
One clear benefit, at least,
is that, with no hooks involved,
there's little danger
of spilling the eel's
toxic blood,
assuming I can catch one.
Having cast my very first
hookless bait,
I wait for a bite.
If anywhere has supersized eels
still prowling the depths,
it has to be a place like this.
Without a hook, though,
I'm in virgin territory.
It feels like
I've been disarmed.
[beeping]
It's still in the mouth.
It's still in its mouth.
Look at that.
Just came out.
Oop!
Come here.
There we go...
My first fish on a bob.
The technique actually works,
and it works for two reasons.
Bit of role reversal here.
Normally it's me
providing the hook.
This eel has got hundreds
of little hooks in its mouth
in the form of teeth,
and that's why it catches
onto that bob.
It sort of hooks in.
The other thing is,
it's a predator,
and so it thinks
that bait is getting away,
so it hangs on,
and if I'm quick about it,
it's up on the bank before it
actually knows what's going on.
Okay. Ooh.
So, I'm putting you back.
No need to struggle.
I'm actually putting you back.
Lovely. I've just caught a fish
without using a hook.
It absolutely works.
Wade:
Spurred on by my success,
I push further
into even wilder backwaters,
to places where few people
ever fish.
The eels here are as bold
and as willing to strike
as any I've seen.
And with my bobbing skills
improving fast,
I'm soon dragging them out
at up to 4 feet long.
But I'm looking for a beast
twice this size,
and time is running out.
If the animal described by
Captain Cook really was an eel,
then, seemingly,
the big ones are very rare
or even, perhaps,
a thing of the past.
So far, the monster I've come
in search of has eluded me,
but I still have
some unfinished business
with the longfin eel
that may yet help me solve
the mystery.
Just in my short time here,
I've been hearing a lot
about their aggression.
I'm in no doubt that I'm dealing
with a very powerful
and large animal.
There were those sheep dragged
into the water and eaten alive,
and that was actually from
somebody who saw that happening.
[sheep bleating]
As for humans, we have a swimmer
who was swimming without clothes
who had his private parts
mauled,
and then there was the diver
having his ribs
actually cracked.
And then, finally,
that newspaper report
of a girl being dragged
into the water.
[girl screaming]
But I have to admit,
there is still a grain of doubt
in my mind.
To be totally convinced,
I need to see the proof
for myself,
and there's only one way
that I can do that.
Wade: My destination
is a remote river
in the heart
of a primeval wilderness.
I want to find out
if wild longfin eels,
large or small,
are willing to attack
a healthy adult human.
I've already been in the water
with these animals in a zoo.
This time, it's going to be
very different.
The place I've chosen
is swarming with eels,
and because they're wild,
they'll be hungry.
The question is,
will they be bold enough
to have a crack at me?
To draw them in, I first soak
my clothes with fish guts.
Put simply, I'm turning myself
into human bait.
Ahh.
I feel my heart
starting to pound.
I've done some crazy things
in my time...
Getting into a pool
with piranhas,
going into murky water
after snakeheads,
but this has to be one of
the scariest things I've done.
For protection,
I'm wearing chain mail gloves
and a thick wet suit,
and I'll be sticking close
to the bank.
Within minutes,
eels start to emerge
from their hiding holes.
The question is,
are any eels going to bite?
That is just so snakelike...
Coming out of the water
with its mouth like that.
I'm hoping they're going
for my hands,
but they seem to be interested
in other parts of my clothing,
which is a bit disconcerting.
And even if I move...
If I move my legs,
I move my hands...
It's not really
sending them away at all.
They're coming right in close.
The thing about these fish...
These are not fish
that people feed.
These are wild fish,
so they are hungry.
They're bumping my legs,
they're tugging at my shirt,
and they're coming in
on my fingers, as well.
I'm actually wearing gloves...
These are kevlar gloves,
and I wouldn't be too happy
doing it without those.
Ah!
I do want to hold my ground.
I mean, I've come this far.
I don't want to get out
too... too quickly.
Wade: It's broad daylight,
and from their point of view,
I'm a big animal,
but they're totally unfazed.
Get out! No!
I'll need kevlar underpants,
as well.
Most fish would not do this
at all, even piranhas.
Ow!
That was inside of the thigh,
inside of the thigh.
What I don't want
is for them to draw blood.
If they draw blood, that could
really get them going.
Ah!
Ah!
That is one aggressive fish.
Ah! Look at that!
Look at that! Look at that!
Look at that!
Look at that!
Ah!
I think it's time for me
to get out. Get out. Get out.
Wade: I came here wondering
if the monster described
so long ago by Captain Cook
was, in fact, a giant eel.
Short of seeing an 8-footer,
I can't be sure.
Yet it's clear to me that,
without protective clothing,
these eels would have
ripped into my flesh
and tried to eat me alive.
And with this animal,
it isn't just about size.
Slip and fall over
in some lonely river,
and it's the hungry pack
that could seal your fate.","The New Zealand longfin eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii) is a species of freshwater eel that is endemic to New Zealand. It is the largest freshwater eel in New Zealand and the only endemic species – the other eels found in New Zealand are the native shortfin eel (Anguilla australis), also found in Australia, and the naturally introduced Australian longfin eel (Anguilla reinhardtii). Longfin eels are long-lived, migrating to the Pacific Ocean near Tonga to breed at the end of their lives. They are good climbers as juveniles and so are found in streams and lakes a long way inland. An important traditional food source for Māori (who name them ōrea), longfin eel numbers are declining and they are classified as endangered, but over one hundred tonnes are still commercially fished each year.


== Description ==

The easiest way to identify the longfin eel is by the length of its fins: the dorsal (top) fin is about two-thirds the length of the body and starts significantly further towards the head than the anal (bottom) fin. In the shortfin eel the fins are of similar length. When a longfin eel bends its loose skin wrinkles distinctively inside each bend, where a shortfin eel's skin is smooth. A longfin's mouth extends past its eyes, further than a shortfin's.
Female longfin eels are larger and longer-lived than males. Males average 66.6 cm but reach up to 73.5 cm in length, with an average age of 23 years (12–35 years). Females are considerably larger, ranging from 73–156 cm with an average length of 115 cm. Females attain an age of 20 to 60 years before migrating to sea to breed. Longfin eels in the North Island migrate at a younger age and thus have faster generation times.
Determining longfin sex is difficult as their sexual organs are not determined until they are over 45 cm in length. The only method to determine longfin eels sex is through internal examination and only becomes easy to distinguish when the eels mature and  migrate.


== Life cycle ==
Like other members of the Anguillidae, longfin eels have a rather unusual life cycle:  they grow and mature into fertile adults in fresh water, then migrate to the sea to breed. This catadromous breeding system also ensures randomised mating, creating a panmictic population.
The New Zealand longfin eel is a very long-lived fish, with records of females reaching 106 years old and weighing up to 24 kg. They have the slowest growth rate of any eel species studied, just 1–2 centimetres a year.

Longfin eels life cycle like other species of Anguillidae eels is rather complex consisting of four distinct life stages which remained a mystery for many decades and still is not fully understood.
New Zealand longfins breed only once at the end of their lives, making a journey of thousands of kilometres from New Zealand to their spawning grounds near Tonga. Their eggs (of which each female eel produces between 1 and 20 million) are fertilized in an unknown manner, but probably in deep tropical water. The mature eels then die, their eggs floating to the surface to hatch into very flat leaf-like larvae (called leptocephalus) that then drift along large oceanic currents back to New Zealand. This drifting is thought to take up to 15 months. There have been no recorded captures of either the eggs or larvae of Longfin eels. Upon arriving in New Zealand, the larvae undergo a transformation (metamorphosis) into glass eels, like small transparent adult eels. These occupy estuaries for their first year, during which they develop colouration and become elvers, which resemble small adult longfin eels. The elvers migrate upstream, where they develop into adults.
The recruitment of glass eels into New Zealand's freshwater river networks is a very variable process, thought to be affected by the El Niño and La Niña Southern Oscillations. This is a major reason for the failure of longfin eel aquaculture in the 1970s.


== Diet ==

Longfin eels have an omnivorous diet and are opportunistic feeders. Their diet as small eels largely consists of insect larvae, such as dragonfly nymphs (Procordulia grayi). As the eels grow, they also feed heavily on Lymnaea snails and fish, including galaxiids, the upland bully, and yearling trout which are taken by larger eels. There are reports of these eels eating small waterfowl, such as ducklings.


== Habitat and distribution ==

Anguilla dieffenbachii is endemic species to New Zealand, widely distributed through the country's lakes and rivers, including the Chatham Islands.
Longfin eels are often found great distances inland (up to 361 km) along fresh waterways and in high country lakes which are connected to the sea. Aiding in their inland distribution is their climbing ability in elver (juvenile) stage, under 12 cm in length. These migration events frequently coincide with increased temperate, water flow and low light conditions. At this size the elvers can travel up to 130 km inland over a summer, and have been observed climbing near-vertical surfaces up to 43 m tall. This feat is accomplished through a combination of surface tension (with the water) and friction.
Where in a waterway longfin eels live depends on their life stage. As juveniles, they prefer shallow water (under 0.5 m deep) with coarse substratum and faster than average stream flow (such as that found in riffles). Adult longfin eels tend to be found next to or under large pieces of debris and undercut river banks.


== Significance for Māori ==
Ōrea are an important traditional food source for Māori, who have long had extensive knowledge of the timing of their upstream and downstream migrations.


== Commercial fishing ==
The commercial fishing of longfin eels began to gain momentum in the 1960s, and by the 1970s there was a 2000 tonne yearly catch. The fishery went into decline in the early 1980s, and in the 2000–2001 fishing season only 1079 tonnes were taken. Commercial longfin eel fishing was included in the Quota Management System (QMS) in 2000 for the South Island and 2004 for the North Island. This set limits to the minimum and maximum size (220 grams and 4 kg) and the Total Allowable Catch (TAC). As of 2007, the TAC has not been reached in any fishing season since the implementation of the QMS. In recognition of the traditional significance of longfin eels, Māori have a 20 percent allocation of fishery stocks. The capture and export of glass eels in New Zealand has been prohibited. As of 2022 up to 137 tonnes of eels including longfin eels were still being caught for export – despite the species being officially classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.


== Aquaculture ==
There have been a number of attempts at aquaculture of longfin eels. The first were in the 1970s, and did not remain operational for long, with the last farm closing in 1982. The most common reasons for these failures were economic (the high cost of production vs low price for the eels), variable recruitment of glass eels, and the high mortality (death) rates in the farms. Since the early 2000s, there has been renewed interest in the aquaculture of longfins due to the increasing knowledge of their biology and the diminishing stocks of European eels (Anguilla anguilla), but no farms have been built.


== Conservation ==
In 2003 biologist Don Jellyman predicted longfin numbers would drop by between 5 and 30% in the following decade. The species was classified in 2014 and again in 2018 by the Department of Conservation as ""At Risk: Declining"" under criteria ""C(2/1) Total area of occupancy > 10 000 ha (100 km2), predicted decline 10–70%"". The DOC panel concluded though that the commercial fishery of the species is stable or increasing, and noted ""that public discourse on the longfin eel portrays the species as being severely threatened despite data that indicate otherwise.""  This conclusion has been seriously questioned, repeatedly, both before and since then, throwing its validity into doubt. 
In June 2012 it was reported that some pet food companies use the nationally threatened eels in their products, sparking outrage by conservationists. Scientists and conservation groups have growing concern for the survival of the species, as they can be legally killed and have a slow reproduction rate, breeding only once at the end of their lifetime. The 2018 IUCN assessment noted a sharp decline in longfin numbers over the last century, accompanied by significant reduction of habitat.
The IUCN currently classes the species as ""Endangered"", making the following notes: ""Population Severely Fragmented; Continued Reduction in Mature Individuals; Continuing Decline in Area/Extent and/or Quality of Habitat""   Despite this, the New Zealand government continues to allow its export and allows legal recreational killing of the fish.

Hidden Predator,Bull Shark,Carcharhinus leucas,"WADE: <i>The bull shark is
the bad boy of the shark world,</i>
<i>thought to be responsible
for more attacks on people</i>
<i>than any other shark.</i>
<i>Their ferocity
is the stuff of nightmares.</i>
<i>Pound for pound, they are
the ultimate killer shark.</i>
<i>Last year, I traveled
to Queensland, Australia,</i>
<i>to investigate three potential
bull shark attacks...</i>
<i>the first in the surf zone
at the mouth of a river...</i>
<i>the second on a man swimming
at night in an inland lagoon...</i>
<i>the third on a thoroughbred
racehorse 80 miles upstream.</i>
<i>At exactly the same time
I was there,</i>
<i>the biggest bull shark
ever caught</i>
<i>was pulled out
of a South African river</i>
<i>popular with swimmers.</i>
<i>Upon hearing this,</i>
<i>I instantly feared
another deadly situation.</i>
<i>My name is Jeremy Wade,</i>
<i>biologist and extreme fisherman.</i>
I travel the world,
<i>investigating stories
of freshwater monsters.</i>
That's the killer blow.
That's about the thickness
of my leg.
This feels a good-size fish.
<i>I'm heading to South Africa</i>
<i>to find out why sharks
are leaving their patch</i>
<i>and moving into mine.</i>
That's the fish...
Dorsal and tail.
Dorsal and tail.
<i>January 2009...
A series of unusual sightings</i>
<i>in the Breede River,
South Africa,</i>
<i>kick-starts an investigation.</i>
<i>What the scientists discover</i>
<i>shocks both the scientific
and the local communities.</i>
<i>For not only is this river
inhabited by sharks,</i>
<i>it is home to the biggest
bull shark ever caught</i>
<i>anywhere in the world.</i>
<i>Measuring 13 feet in length,</i>
<i>it is more than 3 feet longer
than the previous record.</i>
<i>A year later, the team is back</i>
<i>to see if they can discover
why it was here,</i>
<i>why it was so big,
and if that giant was alone.</i>
This is where I come in.
I'm just as puzzled
as the scientists
by what's going on here.
And my many years' experience
of tracking down
and catching monster fish
from rivers
have got me
the unique opportunity
to join the investigation.
What we find out
could help to answer
the most important question
of all...
Is the presence
of this known man-eater
a human tragedy
just waiting to happen?
<i>I'm more accustomed
to searching for monsters</i>
<i>in rivers that tumble
from mountain passes...</i>
[Men singing in native language]
<i>or investigating tribal
myths in tropical jungles...</i>
<i>places very remote
from our modern world.</i>
<i>So this is going to be
very different</i>
<i>from anything I've done before.</i>
<i>This is the sleepy
fishing village of Witsand</i>
<i>in a remote corner
of South Africa...</i>
<i>Not the place I would normally
hunt for a river monster.</i>
<i>However, under the surface
of this peaceful scene</i>
<i>lurks a monster bigger
and more aggressive</i>
<i>than anything
I have ever encountered.</i>
<i>But how can a saltwater shark
survive in freshwater?</i>
<i>It is said that for most sharks,</i>
<i>spending a day in freshwater</i>
<i>would be like a man walking on
the moon without a space suit.</i>
<i>But bull sharks are different.</i>
<i>They have sensors
all over their body</i>
<i>which sample the salt content
of the water,</i>
<i>working in a way
similar to our taste buds.</i>
<i>A special organ
called the rectal gland</i>
<i>acts like an on-off switch,</i>
<i>releasing or retaining salt
as required.</i>
<i>It's their ability to move
from shallow coastal waters,</i>
<i>where they normally live,
up into rivers</i>
<i>that makes them one of the most
dangerous of all sharks.</i>
BOY: Wait!
<i>I've investigated fatal attacks
in Australian rivers,</i>
<i>but bull sharks
have also attacked</i>
<i>in the Ganges in India,
the Tigris in Iran,</i>
<i>in Lake Nicaragua,</i>
<i>and even in the U.S.,
in New Jersey's Matawan Creek.</i>
<i>And now one has been found
here, in the Breede River...</i>
<i>only this one
was much, much bigger...</i>
<i>swimming undetected
where people swim.</i>
<i>Perhaps freshwater rivers are
no safer than the open sea.</i>
<i>So far, I only have a few photos</i>
<i>and newspaper clippings
to go on,</i>
<i>so I meet up with
shark scientist Meaghen McCord,</i>
<i>who brings me right up to date.</i>
What exactly happened last year?
We were here
for three days, fishing.
On the third day, we were
up in the area up there
that's commonly known
as Hunpunt.
<i>Meaghen led
last year's expedition</i>
<i>which caught the bull shark,</i>
<i>known further up the coast
as the Zambezi shark.</i>
McCORD: Suddenly, around 3:00
in the afternoon,
our angler had his fish taken.
[Reel clicking]
And about 2 1/2 hours later,
we managed to see that it
actually was a Zambezi shark.
What are you hoping to find out
this year?
This year, Jeremy, first of all,
we want to find out
whether that shark was just
a once-off in the system.
We're really counting on you
to catch us another animal.
<i>Normally I head out
on my expeditions</i>
<i>to unpick a riddle
and satisfy my own curiosity.</i>
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>I have a scientific team
depending on me,</i>
<i>and the results could mean
the difference</i>
<i>between life and death.</i>
<i>This is the biggest fishing
challenge I have ever faced.</i>
<i>And if I connect
with one of these sharks,</i>
<i>it could be the biggest fish
I have ever hooked.</i>
<i>It's only now that I realize
what I've gotten into.</i>
The sharks in this river have
a very specific way of feeding.
And that has actually given me
quite a challenge
in terms of what rig I use
because I've got to come up
with something
that presents the bait actually
in quite a delicate way,
but at the same time
is strong enough
to give me half a chance
to get the shark in.
And to be honest, at the moment,
I'm not quite sure
how I'm going to achieve that.
<i>Sharks have evolved
the greatest sensitivity</i>
<i>to electricity of any animal.</i>
<i>Tiny pores around the snout</i>
<i>called the ampullae of Lorenzini</i>
<i>detect minute electrical fields</i>
<i>produced by other animals
in the water.</i>
<i>But they could also detect
electrical microcurrents</i>
<i>produced by my metal hook
and leader,</i>
<i>which is going to make bait
presentation very difficult.</i>
I'm basically just looking
at what else I've got in my bag.
I've got various different types
of wire.
I've got smaller hooks.
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
have to play around with stuff
for a few hours and just see
what I can come up with.
What I'm thinking of using
is something like this.
The trouble with these sharks
here is if you fish too heavy,
they're just not gonna take
the bait.
The bait isn't going to act
naturally.
So hopefully something like that
is gonna work.
<i>It's hard to believe</i>
<i>that once I've caught
a potential man-eater,</i>
<i>the scientists will release it
back into the river,</i>
<i>like putting a fox
back into the chicken coop.</i>
<i>It's no surprise that this
project is so controversial.</i>
<i>With my rig built, I team up
with skipper Mark Wolf.</i>
<i>He has years of experience
fishing the Breede River.</i>
<i>His knowledge will be invaluable</i>
<i>if I'm to catch myself
a big shark.</i>
<i>We head to the spot</i>
<i>where the team caught
the monster last year.</i>
<i>To catch sharks
in the Breede River,</i>
<i>you first need live bait.</i>
This feels good bait size.
Very strong.
Oh, there it is.
<i>I only use live bait
if I have to,</i>
<i>and this is
one of those occasions.</i>
<i>The sharks in this river
will eat nothing else.</i>
That's why they're called
a grunter.
You can hear
that noise it makes.
[Fish grunting]
<i>I'm hoping the grunter
struggling on the line</i>
<i>will have caught the attention
of a shark.</i>
<i>I transfer it to my heavier gear</i>
<i>and get it straight back
into the river.</i>
It's actually
a very strongly swimming bait.
It's about 30, 40 yards
off there.
And that's right off the line.
It came in on one hook,
straight onto another one,
and out into the water.
It's possible
if there's shark in the area,
they actually checked that out
on the way in,
and they could well be
sort of lurking around,
eyeing that up.
<i>I'm using a balloon rather
than a conventional float,</i>
<i>attached by a thin rubber band.</i>
<i>This allows the bait
to swim freely in midwater.</i>
<i>But when a shark takes,
the balloon will break away,</i>
<i>so the shark won't feel
any resistance,</i>
<i>which could make it drop
the bait.</i>
<i>I will then begin a count of 20.</i>
<i>I have to know that the shark
has properly taken the bait</i>
<i>so that when I tighten up,</i>
<i>my circle hook will pull
into the corner of its mouth.</i>
<i>I may only get one chance,
and I don't want to blow it.</i>
Just a case now of waiting.
<i>On the surface, this place
is an earthly paradise,</i>
<i>in sharp contrast
to the picture underwater,</i>
<i>where there lurks a beast that
is the embodiment of savagery.</i>
Has the shark taken that, or is
that the bait just running?
That's not shooting out
at speed.
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.
There we go.
One, two, three...
<i>From the moment
the bait's taken,</i>
<i>the speed of the run tells me
this has to be a shark.</i>
Anchor up. Anchor up, please.
Anchor up.
<i>And nothing else in this river
could engulf a bait that size.</i>
11, 12...
<i>Now I must keep a cool head</i>
<i>and wait for a count of 20
before I engage the reel.</i>
18, 19.
Right.
Tightening up. Tightening up.
Tightening up. Tightening up.
There's the balloon
heading for the horizon.
Here we go.
<i>Even with my harness
absorbing a lot of the strain,</i>
<i>this is like nothing
I've ever hooked before.</i>
Oh, this sling's in the way.
A little bit
of an obstacle course.
This fish just feels
so powerful.
Without even really trying,
it's just taking line.
<i>I've chased big fish
all over the world,</i>
<i>and experience tells me</i>
<i>that this could be
the biggest I've hooked...</i>
<i>More than capable
of dragging me overboard</i>
<i>if I make a wrong move.</i>
Looks like it might come up.
Yes!
Just saw a fin
break the surface.
Coming to the left now.
This is quite a fast fish.
It's quite lively, which is good
'cause it means
it's tiring itself out.
Looks like a take on the line.
Coming up. Coming up.
Coming up.
[Reel clicking]
There it is.
I think I could be ready.
Oh!
I think they might have...
What happened?
<i>That shark felt as big
as anything I've ever caught.</i>
What went?
<i>But I'll never know for certain.</i>
Yeah. It went.
[Exhales sharply]
That's actually...
That's bitten through the wire.
Bitten through the wire.
So that's a bite-off.
Ah.
Ah.
Score one to the fish.
<i>I was overconfident.</i>
<i>I thought
I was bringing the shark in,</i>
<i>but now I realize the shark
was bringing the fight to me.</i>
<i>I could see it was large,</i>
<i>but it was not the
1,000-pounder caught last year,</i>
<i>which means there's more than
one shark using this river.</i>
<i>And that's a concern
to everyone living here.</i>
I hate losing fish.
You're always haunted
by the memory of the big one
that got away.
But it did tell me something.
It suggests that there could be
a lot more shark in here
than anyone suspected.
<i>Last year,
the team courted controversy.</i>
<i>After catching
the 1,000-pound bull shark</i>
<i>from this South African river,</i>
<i>they ran a series of tests,
attached an electronic tag,</i>
<i>and then released it
back into the river.</i>
So you got the tag in.
What did you find out from that
tag in the time you were here?
We really had no idea
what to expect from the shark.
Over the course of the next
370 hours that we tracked her,
she moved up and down the river
to within feet of people
who were pumping for prawns
and in shallow water that was
probably just up to mid-thigh.
WADE: And how far up
did you track her?
McCORD: We tracked her as far
as 32 kilometers upriver,
which we thought was really
amazing, and, needless to say,
it sort of freaked out
the local Witsand residents.
<i>Many of the human residents
were less than happy</i>
<i>that the world's biggest
bull shark had been released</i>
<i>and was again swimming freely
in their river.</i>
<i>But this wasn't
the only bull shark</i>
<i>that made the headlines
that week.</i>
<i>Experienced lifeguard
Sikhanyiso Bangilizwe</i>
<i>was keeping watch
over a stretch of beach</i>
<i>along the Natal shore.</i>
<i>He went out on a training swim</i>
<i>on a route he had swum
many times before.</i>
<i>The unprovoked attack
came out of the blue.</i>
<i>Bangilizwe
didn't stand a chance.</i>
<i>Close inspection of the wounds
on Bangilizwe's body</i>
<i>confirmed that it was
a bull shark</i>
<i>that attacked and killed him.</i>
<i>Even though this attack happened</i>
<i>600 miles up the coast,</i>
<i>it still helped
to stoke the anger</i>
<i>in Witsand's
riverside community.</i>
<i>Some residents were
understandably concerned</i>
<i>that the world's
biggest bull shark</i>
<i>had been put back
into their river,</i>
<i>and Meaghen had
some explaining to do.</i>
<i>She even received
serious threats</i>
<i>for her part
in releasing the shark.</i>
<i>It's still hard to believe
that after I catch one,</i>
<i>the scientists will require me
to release it</i>
<i>back into the river,
where people fish and play.</i>
WADE: Oh. Oh.
One, two, three...
<i>I've been given a second chance.</i>
Anchor up, please.
Anchor up.
<i>And I'm not going to
let this one get away.</i>
Tightening up. Tightening up.
Tightening up. Tightening up.
Okay. Right. We're on. We're on.
We're on. We're on.
And it's running.
It's running.
It's running.
Look at that.
It's really cutting sideways.
Really cutting sideways.
- [Reel clicking]
- Oh.
That was really heart-stopping
when it suddenly goes slack.
You think it's off, and then
there's tension there again.
It's probably kicking
or rolling on the line, even.
<i>This apex predator
is not accustomed</i>
<i>to this kind of treatment.</i>
There he is.
<i>Instead of running away,
it's coming in to check me out.</i>
<i>I can't imagine what the shark
is making of this experience.</i>
He's coming down.
With a lot of fish,
you see them up on the surface,
you see them close in,
you think, ""That's it.
They're nearly done there.""
I think this one was just coming
up partly out of curiosity...
""What's all this?
What's happening?""
Now he's checked me out, he's
not coming anywhere near again.
<i>Last time, the shark brought
things to an early end</i>
<i>by rolling on the line.</i>
<i>This one seems set
for the long haul.</i>
Two hours.
Two hours.
It's a different phase
of the fight now.
It was tearing around, you know,
using speed in the early stages.
There it is again.
There it is again.
There it is again.
There's definitely some tactics
going on.
The speed didn't work,
so now just a bit
of a war of attrition.
Ah, this is punishment.
<i>Two hours into the fight,</i>
<i>the shark begins pulling
the boat towards some shallows.</i>
We're under 3 meters now.
<i>By now, the battle is
beginning to attract attention.</i>
<i>This is turning into an event.</i>
<i>Everyone wants to see
this shark.</i>
WADE: I can see the fish.
I can see the fish.
Back to 2 meters.
<i>If my line catches a rock
down there,</i>
<i>it could cut through,
and the shark will be gone.</i>
We got to get away
from the rocks here.
We're still in 2 meters now.
<i>I've got a boat
full of scientists</i>
<i>relying on me
to get this shark in.</i>
<i>The tension on board
is palpable.</i>
- 4 meters.
- There.
Okay, I've got the line.
If it goes, it can go without
the line catching anybody.
Pull that line 'round the...
Right.
Have you got
the tow strap 'round?
- Yep.
- Good. Okay. Brilliant.
- Got a good hold?
- Yeah.
Okay.
<i>This is my biggest catch ever,</i>
<i>and 2 1/2 hours is by far
my longest fight.</i>
<i>It's astonishing to think</i>
<i>that I've hauled this beast
from a river.</i>
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
<i>But I was lucky
to get it in at all</i>
<i>because it was foul-hooked
in the side,</i>
<i>snagged on a flap of skin
between the gill slits.</i>
<i>The scientists want to know
why the sharks are here.</i>
Right. This is like, sort of,
time is of the essence.
And they're actually...
They're starting to pump water
to irrigate the gills.
That buys
a little bit more time.
<i>Last year's giant catch
was a heavily pregnant female,</i>
<i>which led the scientists
to assume</i>
<i>she was in this river to
deliver her 2-foot-long pups.</i>
<i>Our expectation is that
this fish, too, is female.</i>
McCORD:
3, 2, 1.
MAN:
Just gonna hold him in place.
McCORD:
It's a male!
[Indistinct talking]
<i>Our first catch, and we have
answered one of our questions.</i>
<i>It looks like the Breede River</i>
<i>is a place
where sharks come to feed.</i>
McCORD:
3, 2, 1.
<i>9 1/2 feet,</i>
<i>and with an estimated weight
near 500 pounds,</i>
<i>he's one of the largest bull
sharks ever caught anywhere.</i>
<i>And I'm returning him
back into the river.</i>
<i>I've just caught a giant,
but I'm not off the hook.</i>
<i>The scientists want me
to try for another...</i>
<i>And this time, even bigger.</i>
<i>There is heated controversy
about returning the sharks</i>
<i>to the river,
where people swim and play.</i>
<i>But unlike bull sharks
elsewhere in the world,</i>
<i>these bull sharks
have never attacked a person.</i>
<i>So what makes the Breede River
sharks so unusual?</i>
<i>Hunting for clues,
I talk to local fishermen</i>
<i>who fish these waters
for grunter and cob.</i>
- WADE: Big one.
- SVEDE: This one, yeah.
<i>Coba Svede is a fisherman
and a kite surfer.</i>
<i>He's been here for 50 years,</i>
<i>and has had his fair share
of shark encounters.</i>
Any thoughts why that might be?
And you're confident that if
you just take basic precautions,
you're perfectly happy about
going in the water yourself?
<i>Eugene Beukes is one
of only a handful</i>
<i>of commercial fishermen
left in Witsand.</i>
<i>His knowledge of sharks</i>
<i>has been passed down
through his family.</i>
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you surprised that no people
have been attacked?
<i>I've had a call from Paul,
one of the tracking team,</i>
<i>who has just witnessed
a bull shark attack</i>
<i>right off the harbor wall.</i>
This is the victim, is it?
It was incredible.
I just put the boat alongside
and heard a giant splash
about 20 yards
off the harbor wall here.
There was a giant pool of blood.
The fish floated up
to the surface.
<i>One of the reasons bull sharks
got their name</i>
<i>is because they are known
to ram their prey</i>
<i>before they kill it.</i>
<i>This can clearly be seen</i>
<i>by the marks
along the side of this cob.</i>
So you reckon it's actually just
hit it from the sides,
and then, when it's floundering
in the water,
just came along and just...
I mean, that...
I mean, that is just muscle.
But that's the killer blow,
isn't it?
PAUL:
Straight through.
<i>A battering ram
armed with razor-sharp teeth.</i>
That's about the thickness
of my leg,
which is quite disconcerting.
It's gone right through
the backbone as well.
Just clean through.
Gee.
This is actually the biggest cob
that I've seen so far,
and that is <i>without</i>
the final third,
which is out there somewhere
inside a shark.
<i>Witnessing how they hit
monster-size prey</i>
<i>makes me even more determined</i>
<i>to land a monster-size
bull shark.</i>
<i>Before I try again,</i>
<i>I have the opportunity
to discover</i>
<i>exactly what the Breede River
bull sharks are doing</i>
<i>that sets them apart from
bull sharks in other rivers.</i>
<i>We head out to track the shark
that I caught and released.</i>
<i>The acoustic tag,</i>
<i>which we secured
to the back of the shark,</i>
<i>transmits a signal,</i>
<i>which we hear as a ping
on our hydrophone.</i>
<i>The clearer the sound,
the closer the shark.</i>
It's up.
It's up.
WADE: Yeah?
So a bit further up, yeah?
All right.
Maybe the hint of something.
We might be
just out of the main range.
<i>We end up 20 miles upriver
in search of the tagged shark.</i>
[Man shouting indistinctly]
What?
Apparently,
the guy there just said,
""You mustn't catch sharks here
'cause we swim here.""
Um, I'm not quite sure
what the logic of that is.
[Chuckles]
I think, you know, whether we
catch them or not, they're here.
Apparently,
the big one last year
was tracked right past these
houses on several occasions.
Yeah, meanwhile, the one we're
looking for at the moment...
No sign... or shall I say
no sound... of it.
<i>We turn and retrace our steps
back downriver,</i>
<i>searching as we go.</i>
<i>Eventually we come across
a group of fishing boats</i>
<i>just off Witsand.</i>
<i>A couple of fishermen</i>
<i>have just had a very close
encounter with a shark.</i>
Teeth marks there.
Teeth there, teeth there.
Just trying to get a look
at that.
MAN:
He had him in its mouth.
<i>The shark tried to steal their
catch as they brought it in.</i>
<i>So I know there's a shark here,
and it's hungry.</i>
[Pinging]
WADE: Ah, there's a beep
already, yeah?
<i>We found the tagged shark
that I released yesterday.</i>
87, 81.
So we're straight ahead.
So it's actually...
Oh. Oh. 98.
<i>The hydrophone signal peaks
at 100,</i>
<i>so 98 means the shark
is within yards of our boat.</i>
Slightly worried about having
my hands close to the water now.
[Pinging]
83.
There we go.
1:00.
According to the hydrophone,
the fish is being, you know,
right under that boat.
I'm just listening to the beats
and looking at the screen.
And then, when I get
the strongest signal,
I hold it here, I look up,
and it's just pointing
straight at the boat.
<i>The Breede River bull sharks</i>
<i>have learned to shadow
fishing boats,</i>
<i>waiting for fish to be hooked,
then taking them off the line.</i>
<i>It's very specific,
systematic behavior.</i>
<i>There are no records
of bull sharks doing this</i>
<i>anywhere else in the world.</i>
<i>And I just witnessed it
firsthand.</i>
<i>It's like a protection payment.</i>
<i>The sharks steal a percentage
of the fishermen's catch,</i>
<i>and in exchange,
they leave humans alone...</i>
<i>At least for now.</i>
Normally, one of the first
things you've got to do
is actually locate the fish,
but it appears that here,
even though we've got
a lot of water,
I don't have to go looking
for the shark.
They're gonna come looking
for me.
<i>To many, it's the stuff
of nightmares...</i>
<i>A heavily populated river</i>
<i>that's also home to massive,
hungry bull sharks.</i>
<i>But can I make this work</i> for <i>me</i>
<i>and catch myself a monster?</i>
<i>My plan is to position myself
right next to the fishermen</i>
<i>and let the sharks come to me.</i>
Yep, lots of activity
on the river today.
That's gonna get the sharks
quite excited.
<i>I set up seven miles upriver,</i>
<i>in a spot close
to where the team landed</i>
<i>the big female shark
last year...</i>
<i>but well away
from this year's tagged shark,</i>
<i>which was last located
near the river mouth.</i>
<i>The tracking team are out
searching for him right now.</i>
There's boats
generally around the river.
I think the sharks today
are gonna be active.
This is their big feeding day.
This is when the humans come
and do the work for them.
<i>The biggest bull shark
ever recorded</i>
<i>was caught in this river.</i>
<i>And I'm determined
to catch another.</i>
<i>Then the tracking boat appears.</i>
Oh, no.
Right. Meaghen's making signs
like this.
It's checking us out, yeah?
It looks like the tagged shark
is actually around the boat.
And I had no awareness
of that at all
until the tracking boat
turned up.
There's actually been a shark
circling the boat
for quite a few minutes,
apparently,
and we were just
totally unaware of it.
<i>We're being shadowed by a giant
shark which is clearly hunting.</i>
<i>From now on, we'll keep
Meaghen on board</i>
<i>with the tracking equipment.</i>
<i>This way, I'll know exactly
when the tagged shark is nearby</i>
<i>so I can get my bait out
of the water before it strikes.</i>
[Pinging]
It's close.
[Pinging continues]
This is just really frustrating.
It's just proving so hard
to keep away
from that tagged shark.
It's just covering
such an area of water.
It's right behind us now.
And we just popped it in
when we arrived here.
This is actually
one of the favored spots.
All clear, and, you know, about
five minutes after anchoring,
we're getting a signal.
The shark's
right under the boat.
Catching it again would not be
a good idea
because at the moment,
we've got a stable situation.
It comes along.
It's taking fish
from fisherman's boats,
and everybody's happy.
The fishermen aren't too happy,
but that is its main
or important source of food.
If anything actually makes the
sharks wary of fish near boats,
they could start feeding
in a more opportunistic way,
which, you know,
might not be good news
for the people around here.
So very important to avoid
hooking that fish again.
<i>If I hook the same shark again
or if anyone else does,</i>
<i>it may become wary
of its normal food source</i>
<i>and start searching
for other prey.</i>
<i>We move on once again.</i>
<i>We're learning so much</i>
<i>about the behavior of
the bull sharks in this river</i>
<i>that the scientists are
desperate for me</i>
<i>to make another catch.</i>
<i>The capture of the male shark</i>
<i>told us that they're
probably here to feed.</i>
[Pinging]
<i>And the tracking showed us</i>
<i>that they're actively following
fishing boats</i>
<i>for an easy supply of food.</i>
<i>Catching another big one</i>
<i>would confirm the Breede River
as home of the monster sharks.</i>
[Reel clicking]
<i>I've left the tagged shark
several miles upriver</i>
<i>and set up
just off the town of Witsand.</i>
This is what I use
for goliath tigerfish,
Nile perch, things like that...
80-pound line.
So a big shark on here
would be very interesting.
I might just try pulling
the bait a little bit.
If there's a predator watching,
sometimes just a little bit
of movement...
It's thinking about it.
It's thinking, ""Do I want it?
Don't I want it?"" But it's got
time to think about it.
If you move it suddenly,
it can be like a reflex.
Bang... They'll hit it.
Something had a go.
Yeah. Wait a minute.
The balloon is gone.
One, two, three...
<i>This could be the monster
I came here for.</i>
It knows it's hooked now.
This feels a good-size fish.
Oh, wait a minute.
What's happened there?
It's running. It's running.
It's running.
<i>Only a shark in this river runs
with this power and speed.</i>
<i>But I've got a problem.</i>
Oh, wait a minute.
What's happened there?
Suddenly went slack.
No. That's 'round something.
That's 'round something.
Ah!
It's actually snagged.
<i>I've already lost one shark
to a broken line.</i>
<i>I don't want to lose another.</i>
I can still feel the fish.
If we can go back, Mark.
Just get it off that snag,
whatever it is.
This is not good.
I think we're clear.
I think we're clear.
Oh, the line
is a bit shredded there.
Oh, that line is in a bad way.
<i>This shark has taken the line</i>
<i>'round some debris
on the bottom.</i>
<i>And even though
it hasn't gone through,</i>
<i>it's very badly frayed.</i>
I'm only on about...
I don't know...
Might only be 50% strength
on the line.
<i>My line is wearing through.</i>
<i>But if I try to bring
the shark in too quickly,</i>
<i>I could lose it.</i>
I'm just so nervous, 'cause I
know the line's not in good way.
<i>One hour and one mile
further upriver.</i>
A friend of mine who's caught
bull sharks said to me,
""Bull sharks,
it's not like a mako shark,
which is a real speed merchant.""
A bull shark is very solid,
very muscular.
It'll just, like,
take you for a walk.
I feel like a 6-year-old child
taking a Rottweiler for a walk.
<i>It feels bigger and stronger
than the other shark.</i>
It's just getting more lively
all of a sudden.
It's right under the bow.
If we can go left.
All right. Okay.
<i>Three miles from where I hooked
the shark,</i>
<i>and it's still pulling the boat.</i>
People who say catching fish
doesn't cause any pain...
They're wrong.
My back is killing me.
Not to mention
where the rod butt is jammed.
Oh, dear.
It's gonna be an interesting
color after the end of all this.
<i>As the hours pass,</i>
<i>the shark continues to drag
the boat up the river.</i>
This is totally not normal
in a river.
I had a giant stingray on
for two hours.
But we've gone past that.
It must be 2 3/4 now.
<i>The fight is now heading
towards its third hour.</i>
<i>The shark has taken the boat
and me four miles upriver.</i>
It might come up.
It might come up.
Coming towards the surface.
- [Reel clicking]
- That's the tail.
That's the fish...
Dorsal and tail.
Dorsal and tail.
First time
it's broken the surface.
It's gonna show again.
[Reel clicking]
That's the dorsal.
Ah!
Wait.
It's under the boat.
Back, please. Back, back,
back, back, back, back.
That's the last... Here we go.
Right.
Now absolute concentration.
If I say let go,
just let go, all right?
Okay!
[Grunts]
<i>The gaff is necessary
to hold the head up,</i>
<i>but it barely punctures
the tough skin.</i>
Bloody hell!
It's not really gaffed, is it?
This is gonna break the gaff.
It's gonna break
the bloody gaff.
<i>This shark has battled with me
for 3 1/2 hours</i>
<i>and dragged the boat
five miles up the river.</i>
Get to the back, I think.
McCORD:
We just need to get to the back.
You guys need to get off.
Never had a fight
anywhere like that long before.
That's almost double
the longest fight I had
with a freshwater stingray,
and those things just glue
themselves to the bottom.
Wow.
[Chuckles]
McCORD:
Pull.
WADE:
The gaff's now out.
<i>This bull shark
is definitely larger</i>
<i>than the last one I caught.</i>
<i>We'll keep it alive
while the team take samples,</i>
<i>measure it,
and insert the acoustic tag,</i>
<i>then get it back into the river.</i>
Sharks can actually
pump water over their gills,
so I'm wedging the mouth open
with a bit of wood
and just shoving water
in its mouth.
<i>It's another male bull shark...</i>
<i>9'10"" long
and more than 500 pounds...</i>
<i>The biggest fish
I've ever caught,</i>
<i>and one of the largest
male bull sharks ever landed.</i>
Tags are there, samples taken,
parasites, all the rest of it.
Very quick operation.
But this thing having been
so strong for so long
is now just feeling
a bit like I am.
So we just need to
get it revived.
<i>Sharks trigger a primal fear
like no other,</i>
<i>and even though
it's utterly exhausted</i>
<i>after fighting with me
for nearly four hours,</i>
<i>this bull shark can still
prompt a nervous run for land.</i>
McCORD:
[Laughs]
<i>Two catches, proving that last
year's shark was not a fluke</i>
<i>and that the Breede River
is home</i>
<i>to some of the largest bull
sharks anywhere in the world.</i>
When I first came here,
I never imagined
that what we would find out
would take the investigation
so far forward
and actually provide
likely answers
to some of the big questions
about the sharks in this river.
It seems that they come here
during the warmer months
of the year to feed.
But it's not
a random feeding strategy.
Instead of wasting energy
by chasing free-swimming fish,
they're actually taking
their food from anglers' lines,
like plucking fruit from a tree.
It's a very efficient way
of feeding,
and perhaps this explains
why the sharks in this river
are so big.
This easy food source
also possibly explains
why there have never been
any attacks on humans.
And as long as the numbers of
those small fish remain healthy,
this remarkable coexistence
between humans
and potential man-eaters
should continue.","The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark (informally zambi) in Africa and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a species of requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. It is known for its aggressive nature, and presence mainly in warm, shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and (usually) lower reaches of rivers. Their aggressive nature has led to ongoing shark-culling efforts near beaches to protect beachgoers, which is one of the causes of bull shark populations continuing to decrease. Bull sharks are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
Bull sharks are euryhaline and can thrive in both salt and fresh water. They are known to travel far up rivers, and have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, about 1,100 kilometres (700 mi) from the ocean, but few freshwater interactions with humans have been recorded. Larger-sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of nearshore shark attacks, including many incidents of shark bites attributed to other species.
Unlike the river sharks of the genus Glyphis, bull sharks are not true freshwater sharks, despite their ability to survive in freshwater habitats.
This shark appears in the image of the 2000 colones bill from Costa Rica.


== Etymology ==
The name ""bull shark"" comes from the shark's stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive, unpredictable behavior. In India, the bull shark may be confused with the Sundarbans or Ganges shark. In Africa, it is also commonly called the Zambezi River shark, or just ""zambi"".
Its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names, including Ganges River shark, Fitzroy Creek whaler, van Rooyen's shark, Lake Nicaragua shark, river shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, Swan River whaler, cub shark, and shovelnose shark.


== Evolution ==
Some of the bull shark's closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation. Its genus, Carcharhinus, also includes the sandbar shark, which is not capable of osmoregulation.
The bull shark shares numerous similarities with river sharks of the genus Glyphis, and other species in the genus Carcharhinus, but its phylogeny has not been cleared yet.


== Anatomy and appearance ==
Bull sharks are large and stout, with females being larger than males. The bull shark can be up to 81 cm (2 ft 8 in) in length at birth. Adult female bull sharks average 2.4 m (8 ft) long and typically weigh 130 kg (290 lb), whereas the slightly smaller adult male averages 2.25 m (7 ft) and 95 kg (209 lb). While a maximum size of 3.5 m (11 ft) is commonly reported, a single record exists of a female specimen of exactly 4.0 m (13 ft). A 3.25 m (10.7 ft) long pregnant individual reached 450 kg (990 lb). The maximum weight of the 4.0 m (13 ft) long pregnant female can be over 600 kg (1,300 lb), ranking it among the largest of the requiem sharks. Bull sharks are wider and heavier than other requiem sharks of comparable length, and are grey on top and white below. The second dorsal fin is smaller than the first. The bull shark's caudal fin is longer and lower than that of the larger sharks, and it has a small snout, and lacks an interdorsal ridge.
Bull sharks have a bite force up to 5,914 newtons (1,330 lbf), weight for weight the highest among all investigated cartilaginous fishes.


=== Exceptional specimens ===
In early June 2012, off the coast of the Florida Keys near the western part of the Atlantic Ocean, a female believed to measure at least 2.4 m (8 ft) and 360–390 kg (800–850 lb) was caught by members of the R.J. Dunlap Marine Conservation Program. In the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, a pregnant shark weighing 347.8 kg (767 lb) and measuring 3 m (10 ft) long was caught in February 2019, followed by another specimen weighing about 350 kg (770 lb) and measuring about the same in length, in January 2020. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the very largest, exceptional specimens can possibly weigh up to 900 kg (2,000 lb).


== Distribution and habitat ==
The bull shark is commonly found worldwide in coastal areas of warm oceans, in rivers and lakes, and occasionally salt and freshwater streams if they are deep enough. It is found to a depth of 150 m (490 ft), but does not usually swim deeper than 30 m (98 ft). In the Atlantic, it is found from Massachusetts to southern Brazil, and from Morocco to Angola.
Populations of bull sharks are also found in several major rivers, with more than 500 bull sharks thought to be living in the Brisbane River. One was reportedly seen swimming the flooded streets of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, during the 2010–11 Queensland floods. Several were sighted in one of the main streets of Goodna, Queensland, shortly after the peak of the January 2011, floods. A large bull shark was caught in the canals of Scarborough, just north of Brisbane within Moreton Bay. Still greater numbers are in the canals of the Gold Coast, Queensland. In the warmer months of the year, bull sharks frequent Sydney Harbour. In the Pacific Ocean, it can be found from Baja California to Ecuador.
The bull shark has traveled 4,000 km (2,500 mi) up the Amazon River to Iquitos in Peru and north Bolivia. It also lives in freshwater Lake Nicaragua, in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers of West Bengal, and Assam in Eastern India and adjoining Bangladesh. It can live in water with a high salt content as in St. Lucia Estuary in South Africa. Bull sharks have been recorded in the Tigris River since at least 1924 as far upriver as Baghdad, and has been rumored to also inhabit  the Cahora Bassa lake upstream of the Zambezi. The species has a distinct preference for warm currents.
After Hurricane Katrina, many bull sharks were sighted in Lake Pontchartrain. In July 2023 some local fishermen in the Atchafalaya River have reported increasing numbers. Bull sharks have occasionally gone as far upstream in the Mississippi River as Alton, Illinois. Bull sharks have also been found in the Potomac River in St. Mary's County, Maryland. From 1996 to 2013, a golf course lake at Carbrook, Logan City, Queensland, Australia was the home to several bull sharks. They were trapped following a flood of the Logan and Albert Rivers in 1996, and resided in the 51 acres (21 ha) lake until 2013, when they disappeared after another series of floods. The golf course capitalized on the novelty, changing their logo to feature the sharks and hosting a monthly tournament called the ""Shark Lake Challenge"".


== Behavior ==


=== Freshwater tolerance ===
The bull shark is the best known of 43 species of elasmobranch, across 10 genera and four families, to have been reported in fresh and/or brackish water. Other species that enter rivers include the stingrays (Dasyatidae, Potamotrygonidae and others) and sawfish (Pristidae). Some skates (Rajidae), smooth dogfishes (Triakidae), and sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) regularly enter estuaries.
The bull shark is diadromous, meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease, as they are euryhaline fish—able to quickly adapt to a wide range of salinities. Thus, the bull shark is one of the few cartilaginous fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems. Many of the euryhaline fish are bony fishes, such as salmon or tilapia, and are not closely related to bull sharks. Evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect, with one being that the bull shark experienced a population bottleneck during the last ice age. This bottleneck may have separated the bull shark from the rest of the Elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system.
Elasmobranchs' ability to enter fresh water is limited because their blood is normally at least as salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much higher than that of the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride. The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also play an important role in the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood. The gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water, whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity. Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.
Bull sharks are able to regulate themselves to live in either fresh or salt water. It can live in fresh water for its entire life, but this does not happen, mostly due to the reproductive needs of the shark. Young bull sharks leave the brackish water in which they are born and move out into the sea to breed. While is theoretically possible for bull sharks to live purely in fresh water, experiments conducted on bull sharks found that they died within four years. The stomach was opened and all that was found were two small, unidentifiable fishes. The cause of death could have been starvation since the primary food source for bull sharks resides in salt water.
In a research experiment, the bull sharks were found to be at the mouth of an estuary for the majority of the time. They stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water. The driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water, however, is its age; as the bull shark ages, its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases. The majority of the newborn or very young bull sharks were found in the freshwater area, whereas the much older bull sharks were found to be in the saltwater areas, as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity. Reproduction is one of the reasons why adult bull sharks travel into the river—it is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival and a way to increase overall fitness of bull sharks. The young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity, so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out.
Initially, scientists thought the sharks in Lake Nicaragua belonged to an endemic species, the Lake Nicaragua shark (Carcharhinus nicaraguensis). In 1961, following specimen comparisons, taxonomists synonymized them. Bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean (and vice versa), with some taking as few as seven to 11 days to complete the journey.
A study of six bull sharks confined to a stagnant golf course lake in Brisbane, Australia, from 1996 to 2013 uncovered their adaptability to low-salinity environments, marking the longest recorded residency for the species under such conditions, and demonstrating their ability to live indefinitely in low-salinity aquatic environments.


=== Diet ===
The bull shark is a marine apex predator, capable of taking a variety of prey. The bull shark's diet consists mainly of bony fish and small sharks, including other bull sharks, and stingrays. Their diet can also include turtles, birds, dolphins, terrestrial mammals, crustaceans, and echinoderms. They hunt in murky waters where it is harder for the prey to see the shark coming. Bull sharks have been known to use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey. After the first initial contact, they continue to bite and tackle prey until the prey is unable to flee.
The bull shark is a solitary hunter, though may briefly pair with another bull shark to make hunting and tricking prey easier.
Sharks are opportunistic feeders, and the bull shark is no exception to this, as it is part of the Carcharhinus family of sharks. Normally, sharks eat in short bursts, and when food is scarce, sharks digest for a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation. As part of their survival mechanism, bull sharks will regurgitate the food in their stomachs in order to escape from a predator. This is a distraction tactic; if the predator moves to eat the regurgitated food the bull shark can use the opportunity to escape.


=== Reproduction ===
Bull sharks mate during late summer and early autumn, often in bays and estuaries. After gestating for 12 months, a bull shark may give birth to 1 to 13 live young.
They are viviparous, born live and free-swimming. The young are about 70 cm (27.6 in) at birth. The bull shark does not rear its young; the young bull sharks are born into flat, protected areas. Coastal lagoons, river mouths, and other low-salinity estuaries are common nursery habitats.
The male bull shark is able to begin reproducing around the age of 15 years while the female cannot begin reproducing until the age of 18 years. The size of a fully matured female bull shark to produce viable eggs for fertilization seems to be 175 cm to 235 cm. The courting routine between bull sharks has not been observed in detail as of yet. The male likely bites the female on the tail until she can turn upside down and the male can copulate at that point. Mature females commonly have scratches from the mating process.


=== Interactions with humans ===

Since bull sharks often dwell in very shallow waters, are found in many types of habitats, are territorial by nature, and have no tolerance for provocation, they may be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark. Bull sharks are one of the three shark species (along with the tiger shark and great white shark) most likely to bite humans.
One or several bull sharks may have been responsible for the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. While it is a common misconception that these attacks were the inspiration for the novel Jaws, its author Peter Benchley has stated this is not the case. The speculation that bull sharks may have been responsible is based on two fatal bites occurring in brackish and fresh water.
Bull sharks have attacked swimmers around the Sydney Harbour inlets. In India, bull sharks swim up the Ganges, Bramaputra, Mahanadi, and other Indian rivers and have bitten bathers. Many of these bite incidents were attributed to the Ganges shark, Glyphis gangeticus, a critically endangered river shark species, although the sand tiger shark was also blamed during the 1960s and 1970s.
Bull sharks have also attacked humans off the coast of Florida.


=== Visual cues ===
Behavioral studies have confirmed that sharks can take visual cues to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting was found to be easily avoided when it was placed in the path of the bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black.


=== Energy conservation ===
In 2008, researchers tagged and recorded the movements of young bull sharks in the Caloosahatchee River estuary. They were testing to find out what determined the movement of the young bull sharks. It was found that the young bull sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed. This large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators. The movement was found to be directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself. One way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes, the bull shark uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver. Another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment.


== Ecology ==
Humans are the biggest threat to bull sharks. Larger sharks, such as the tiger shark and great white shark, may attack them, but typically only target juveniles. Crocodiles may be a threat to bull sharks in rivers. Saltwater crocodiles have been observed preying on bull sharks in the rivers and estuaries of Northern Australia, and a Nile crocodile was reportedly sighted consuming a bull shark in South Africa.


== Conservation ==

The bull shark is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List and its population is decreasing. Despite its status, the species isn't named as a protected species. Threats to the bull shark are numerous, such as getting caught in fishing nets, overfishing for their oil, skin, and meat, pollution to their habitat, and more. In many areas of the world, including Australia and South Africa, there are shark-culling measures around beaches to prevent attacks on beach-goers. Researchers tried to fix the problem of sharks getting too close to land by testing out a device called the SharkSafe Barrier™. This barrier used magnetic and visual stimuli, which utilized rows of piping to create a continuous magnetic field to deter the sharks. However, researchers concluded that the technology needs to be improved and tested further before it can be implemented as a reliable safety measure. Other research is being conducted to come up with conservation solutions for the bull sharks. One example is The Nature Conservancy satellite tagging sharks to track their migration and find their habitats in order to guide what areas require further protection projects.

Jungle Killer,Wolf Fish,Hoplias aimara,"[thunder crashes]
My name is Jeremy Wade,
and I hunt monsters...
river monsters.
I'm always on the alert
for new information,
new leads,
and new investigations.
I've received
a tantalizing report.
It's a story about a fish
apparently attacking a diver.
Now, there are frustratingly
few details.
And that's no wonder,
because this story
comes from a remote country
in South America...
A country called Suriname.
But from what I've heard,
this is not the work
of South America's
most notorious river monster,
the piranha, so what is it?
Can there really be a fish
that pound-for-pound
can challenge the piranha...
Here we go.
For the title of the most
ferocious river monster
of South America?
There's only one way
to find out.
Wade:
In pursuit of river monsters,
I travel to the four corners
of the globe.
Suriname is one place
I've never had cause to visit
until now.
I've come to investigate
the possibility
that although everyone knows
the notorious piranha...
there may be a fish out here
that has an even more
fearsome reputation.
Suriname is South America's
best-kept secret.
It is the smallest country
on the continent,
with a population of only
half a million people,
but it can boast the largest
continuous area
of unspoiled rainforest
in the world.
Once a Dutch colony,
it is a true melting pot of
nationalities and cultures.
The majority
of the sparse population
live along the coast,
so the deeper
into the country you go,
the further you are
from the civilized world.
I have been
to remote places before,
but this is of a new order.
If things go wrong out here,
there is little hope
of being rescued.
But first, I have to meet
the victim in the story...
The man who was attacked
by this mystery fish.
I've arranged to meet him
where the attack happened,
at the dam two hours out
of the capital, Paramaribo.
Wade: The dam was built
on the Suriname River
and completed in 1964,
creating one of the largest
man-made lakes in the world,
called Brokopondo,
on the banks of which
I meet Morris Gantz,
a local man of Dutch decent.
What was your job on the dam
at the time?
This was definitely not
a piranha attack.
They rush in, snatching quick,
savage bites.
They don't cling onto their
victims like a dog with a bone.
Morris' mutilated hand
needed over 100 stitches,
and even though
it was 20 years ago,
he still very much
bears the scars.
That's the scar here?
It's hard to believe
there's a freshwater fish
that would launch
a solo attack on a diver.
Did you know what fish it was?
Wade: Anjumara,
also known as the wolffish,
so-called
for its wolf like teeth.
These fish can grow
to nearly 4½ feet
and weigh 80 pounds.
They are serious predators.
But I had until now
never heard of one
ever attacking a person.
I wonder if Morris
ever had any other kind
of close encounter
while he was diving.
Did that make you
slightly nervous?
They never came and took a nip
out of any...
No, no, no, no. No.
So Morris often saw piranhas,
but they never, ever came
close, unlike this lone wolf.
Wade: This fish attacked,
and if Morris hadn't
had his knife,
who knows
what could have happened?
Could it be that the wolffish
is more dangerous
than the more notorious
South-American horror,
the piranha?
To find out,
I need to confront one myself.
I wonder if Morris' monster
still haunts this river.
From experience,
many river monsters have little
regard for our modern world.
I've caught them near dams
and in cities.
Would this monster
be any different?
The attack on Morris
was 20 years ago,
and as far as I'm aware,
nothing like that has happened
in this place since.
And also, this place seems to be
comparatively developed.
So I'm not really sure if this
is where I should be looking.
I persevere through the night,
but with no luck.
Wade: In the morning,
I head back into town
to Paramaribo,
Suriname's capital city.
I need to find out
where wolffish can be found.
I head downtown to the
fish market to try my luck.
This looks like
a small anjumara...
Small wolffish.
[speaking native language]
Small, is it? Ah, yeah, yeah,
I understand. I understand.
This one isn't actually
the anjumara.
This is a small relative
called here the pataka.
I've caught something
very similar to this...
Maybe actually the same
as this... in brazil.
Those teeth are probably almost
as vicious as a piranha's,
and they're also very slippery.
It's like a bar of soap
with teeth.
The big one is a sort of
scaled-up version of this,
which is what we're looking for.
The wolffish I'm hunting
are 10 times larger than these.
There are no wolffish here,
but I don't leave empty-handed.
I've been told of an old,
retired anjumara fisherman
who lives in town.
Maybe he can tell me where I
can find one of these monsters.
His name is Fritz Van der Bosch.
He shows me
his old wolffish gear.
So this is very strong line.
It may be outdated,
but it's an impressive rig.
And as we settle down to chat,
he tells me of
his own strange experience
of being attacked by a wolffish.
Yes.
So, your leg
was out of the water.
[laughs]
Wade: This story really
puts the wolffish
into a different league.
I have never heard of a fish
trying to attack someone
on land before.
And there's another,
more chilling story.
Reptilian monsters
like anacondas and gators
are known to snatch dogs
from the water's edge.
But a fish?
Now I'm even more determined
to find a wolffish.
But it sounds like
what you need to do now
is go a long way away.
So now you can't just do
a short fishing trip.
You have to make an expedition.
Sure.
Okay.
Wade:
It seems that people have
driven out this aquatic wolf.
It now exists
only beyond civilization.
To take it on, I'm now preparing
to travel deep into
Suriname's wild interior.
Usually, there are signs
of human habitation
dotted around,
but out here, there is nothing.
I once survived
a plane crash in Brazil
and was lucky enough
to walk to a nearby town.
But out here,
I wouldn't stand a chance.
The landing strip is the only
clear patch of forest
I have seen
for nearly two hours.
I wonder just what
I've got myself into.
Pieter Sonneveld has a European
name but is 100% Surinamese.
He will help me talk
with the local people
so I can collate any wolffish
stories from this area.
Wade: On the ground,
the rainforest is as impressive
as it is from the air,
but our isolation
is even more apparent.
Not only are the heat
and humidity oppressive,
but our little group are
possibly the only human beings
in thousands of acres
of tangled rainforest.
At night, this place takes on
an even more sinister character.
[animals calling]
Well, it looks like
we're just about here,
but I'm not totally sure
where here is.
But it does sound like
there's some serious water
over here somewhere.
But I'm gonna have to wait
until the morning
to see exactly
what I'm up against.
In all my years of fishing,
this could be the most
unspoiled and remote river
that I've ever fished.
The mighty Corentyne River
is 450 miles long,
and Suriname's largest.
For most of its length,
it is completely uninhabited
and rarely explored.
Wade:
The river is punctuated
by frequent crushing rapids
and deep, turbulent pools.
There are vast
granite boulders everywhere,
some just under the water,
others creating waterfalls.
There are so many different
fishing holes
that I take every opportunity
to get a bait or lure
in the river
to cover as much water as I can.
Different types of fish prefer
different parts of the river.
Having never hunted
for wolffish here,
I need to explore
every likely fishing spot
to see if I can discover
the monster's lair.
I'm using my short
bait caster rod for accuracy
to get my eye in.
Although it looks lightweight,
this beauty with
its strong, braided line
is capable of landing fish
over 100 pounds.
But there are more
than just wolffish here.
The Corentyne is also home
to the red-eye piranha,
one of the largest of its kind.
This river really is
the best place
to compare these two toothy
South American monsters.
That's a fish on.
Fish on.
Hey, fish off.
[growls]
Suddenly, I'm getting action
every cast.
Aah!
When you get these things in,
they are just so well-hooked,
and yet sometimes you hook one,
and somehow, it just manages
to get rid of the hooks.
That's quite dramatic, though.
Short, but very, very dramatic.
That's one on.
That's one on.
Let's see if I can
keep this one.
But is this a wolffish?
I haven't seen the fish yet.
That is a piranha in the back.
Foul-hooked always feels bigger.
[exhales sharply]
Monster piranha.
That is black in color.
Wade:
Just by looking at one,
you can understand
the piranha's reputation.
But I've done experiments
using myself as a guinea pig,
and I've concluded
that they're only dangerous
to people
in extreme circumstances.
For piranhas, the mob rules.
It's death by 1,000 cuts.
And for that,
they have no equal.
But I'm comparing wolffish
with piranhas one against one,
and having now seen the piranhas
they have to compete with,
I'm even more wary
about meeting a wolffish.
I wonder if, like wolves,
the fish I'm after
are nocturnal hunters,
so I continue
fishing into the night,
but it's too risky
to move around.
There are too many hazards
and dangers
that could send me
into the dark water.
So I change tactics
and stick to the shore.
I'm fishing with a big bait
cast into the stream.
Fish on.
But it's just
another monster piranha.
He's supposed to be asleep now,
but there's always one.
There's always one.
Eh.
It's November, and the rainy
season is fast approaching.
Carbon-fiber rods make
excellent lightning conductors.
I don't know how long
I can stay out here.
Luckily,
something picks up the bait.
It feels big...
Much bigger than anything
I've hooked so far.
The question is, do I have
one on the end of my line?
All right,
this is a new species for here.
That's a red-tailed catfish.
That's about the size
of what I want,
but it's the wrong species.
The local name for these fish
is the motro tejalie,
which translates as ""motor car""
on account of all the noises
they make
when out of the water.
Oops.
Red-tailed catfish.
It's another species
that's active at night.
Not what I was after,
but it's quite interesting just
to see a bit of variety here.
It's a familiar species to me,
but in a different part
of South America.
Bit of excitement.
But the wrong kind
of excitement.
[thunder crashes]
[animals calling]
Wade: After several more days
of trying with no success,
my guide, Pieter, suggests
we visit the only village
in the area
and talk with the locals
to see if they can give us
the information that we need.
The Tiriyo tribe's village
at Amatopo
has no more than 20 huts.
It is their only settlement
on the Corentyne River.
They live with the wolffish,
so they know it better
than anyone.
I'm hoping they will share
some of its secrets with me.
How dangerous exactly
is the anjumara?
[speaking native language]
Yateo was hunting,
and he came to a creek near here
called Mosquito Creek.
And there was a troop of monkeys
crossing the creek.
[speaking native language]
They were going to the furthest
branch on one side,
jumping across onto the furthest
branch the other side,
and the whole group of monkeys
had jumped,
apart from the last one.
One missed the branch,
landed in the water.
As soon as it hit the water,
it was attacked by a wolffish
and killed.
Suddenly the stories
come thick and fast.
So, somebody was actually
bitten on the arm.
That speaks of a real sort
of aggression.
Yateo's uncle was hunting
one day with his dog.
[dog barking]
The hunting dogs,
when they're hunting,
they're barking,
barking, barking.
[barking continues]
Yateo's uncle found his dog
dead in the creek
with its stomach ripped open.
And there's now another incident
of somebody getting bitten...
In this case, on the thumb.
So it's another two animals
to add to the list...
Snakes swimming on the surface
and just being taken from below.
There's a type of bird
called an anamu.
This is a bird that comes
to the water to drink,
and likewise, that's just
grabbed by one of these fish
just lurking there in ambush.
He's sort of, you know,
wary about getting
in the water sometimes.
[speaking native language]
People outside South America...
They know all about piranhas.
Now, locally, wolffish...
This is a fish
with a very big reputation.
It's known to be
very aggressive,
and there are
certain circumstances
where they will literally
rip anything apart
that goes near them...
Reptiles, birds, primates,
even people.
[speaking native language]
Wade: After listening
to the Tiriyo tribe,
it's clear that having
the weaponry is one thing,
having the attitude
is quite another.
The wolffish is well equipped
with both.
But one thing still eludes me...
Where do you find them?
Salamoni agrees
to take me fishing,
but it's like no fishing
I've done before.
Straightaway, we do something
I wasn't expecting.
Salamoni leads me
to a narrow creek...
One that no one has been
through for some time.
We then take to the land
and creep through the jungle.
Looks like
we're following the course
of sort of a dried-up subcreek,
so the chances are there's going
to be a bit of a junction here.
That does look like the kind of
place where you might find fish.
Wade: He fishes with
a bow and arrow,
the way his ancestors have
for centuries.
He's stringing the bow.
Just getting the tension
in the bow.
[Salamoni calling]
Wade: This is mimicking
the sound of a water bird,
so there's a little bit of
disturbance on the surface,
a little bit of whistling.
The idea is
this calls the wolffish in.
[calling continues]
I don't know if
it's coincidence or what,
but I've just seen movement
on the surface,
which looked very much
like a wolffish.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[arrow fires]
Oh. It's on.
Wade: He missed it,
but it has given me the last
piece of this puzzle.
One thing very, very striking.
That fish, when it came in,
that was in very shallow water.
Not just that...
Very, very tangly water.
So this isn't a monster
of the deep.
This is a monster
sometimes of the shallows.
The fishing with a line is
gonna be very close quarters,
and also these snags are going
to present a real problem...
Not just in terms
of getting a bait
to a place where the fish
can take it,
but also,
if I get a heavy fish on,
extracting it from
all this stuff, you know.
It's going to be
very challenging.
And who knows?
That might even be at night.
So this is going to be
quite some fishing.
I decide to have a go myself
using the gear
I'm accustomed to.
Wade: I'm now using
my larger fixed-spool reel
and a big chunk of bait
with a wire trace
to stop any sharp teeth
from biting through.
I'm also trying to make some
disturbance on the surface
like Salamoni did
to see if it will attract
any hungry wolffish.
No takes on the bait.
No reaction to the popper.
Looks a good spot,
but doesn't seem to be
anything at home.
We've reached the end
of the navigable stretch
of this creek now.
It's just this impenetrable
tangle of branches now.
So if we were to hack our way
through there,
we'd just disturb everything,
and you could hardly get a bait
into the water.
Anyway, very,
very interesting fishing.
On our way back to the village
on the main river,
conditions are changing.
It may be nothing
to worry about,
this black cloud here,
because the weather
in the tropics,
it can be very localized.
You can see a storm over
in one direction.
Maybe it comes your way...
You get wet...
Maybe it goes somewhere else.
But it seems to have passed us
by, or so I think.
Wade: With nothing for the pot,
Salamoni takes me on a detour
to catch some fish for dinner.
Think this could be
our spot here.
So, off the rocks,
there's gonna be a nice slack
with eddies happening
on the other side.
But out on this exposed island,
in the middle of the river,
we are about to discover
just how changeable
and dangerous
conditions are
in the rainforest.
This is a classic example
of pure fishing, in a way.
It's starting
with absolutely nothing...
Just coming down with
a couple of rods, no bait,
and just poking around
in these cracks to find crabs.
And a crab is pulled to pieces,
and that's where we start from.
Hopefully, we turn that...
[thunder crashes]
Man: [bleep] me!
Should I take this off?
Wade: I would.
I would.
That lightning strike...
Salamoni was standing
in the water.
He actually felt a shock,
got a shock through the water.
Abandoning...
We're getting into the boat,
and we're going.
I thought we'd all escaped
that lightning strike.
The sound man on my crew didn't.
Our sound recordist
has been hit...
Was actually struck on the head
by that bolt of lightning.
Chris, are you okay?
Are you responding?
Good, good, good, good.
We might need some
first aid here. Let's go.
Quick, quick, quick.
How are you feeling?
All right.
We're moving away
from the storm.
That's good.
Right.
Rubber soles, rubber soles,
rubber soles. Good.
Wade: I've got a bit
of a headache.
James, who is behind the camera
at the moment,
has got a headache.
I think it might have actually
hit all three of us.
Chris definitely
got the brunt of it.
Very, very lucky for him
he was actually wearing
thick, rubber-soled boots.
So he's conscious,
which is a huge relief.
We're arriving back at the camp.
Wade: I suspect that
the lightning bolt
actually struck very close
to where we were all standing.
We all felt the effects
of the strike,
but Chris was obviously
the closest.
The remoteness of our location
is now even more apparent.
But thankfully, Chris'
condition continues to improve,
and within 12 hours, he is
once more back on his feet
and eager to get me
fishing again.
If you just tell me again
how far from here we're going.
That night,
Pieter lays out his plans
for us to head even deeper
into the jungle
to try and reach some creeks
that he believes will be
the best places
for us to catch a wolffish.
But it will mean camping
and being self-sufficient
for several days
in a place even more remote.
With all that has happened,
it is a brave plan,
and we decide to sleep on it.
But I discuss it with the crew,
and there's really
only one decision.
I'm actually going
even more remote,
if such a thing is possible.
I figure that if I'm gonna
find a big wolffish,
I'm gonna need to go somewhere
where even the Tiriyo
don't normally go.
The sheer size of the
Corentyne River is humbling.
In places,
it is over two miles wide,
a confusion of
tangled islands, channels,
rocky outcrops,
and narrow rapids.
We are using a local boatman
called bona
who knows the river well.
Without him,
I would quickly become lost
in this watery maze.
The jungle echoes
with eerie calls and cries,
but it is too impenetrable
to reveal the creatures
making the noise.
[animals calling]
Three hours later,
and with nothing but endless
rainforest on either bank,
we arrive at our new base camp.
It's a collection
of small tents on a sandbar
on an island
in the middle of nowhere.
From here, I will carry out
my campaign to catch a wolffish.
I waste no time getting ready.
And before the sun sets,
we head out to the nearest
creek to get our bearings.
Wolffish, it seems, head up
creeks during the wet season,
dispersing
into the flooded forest.
But as the water recedes,
they are forced back down
towards the main river.
It is then that they are
their easiest to find.
I'm here in what should be
the lowest water levels
of the year,
but straightaway,
it is apparent the conditions
are not ideal.
Very much mixed feelings
on arriving at the camp.
The thing that
struck me immediately
was that the water level
is probably about two foot up
on what we'd hoped for,
what we'd expected,
and what is ideal
for catching the wolffish.
Basically, what that means is
that the creeks are gonna be
that much fuller,
so the fish aren't
gonna be concentrated.
They're gonna be
spread up the creek.
They won't be as hungry.
They won't be as aggressive.
So catching them is likely to be
harder than I expected.
Wade: I have now heard
incredible stories
of how fearless wolffish are.
I have caught the huge piranha
that they compete with
in these rivers.
I have traveled so far
and risked so much
that to fall at the last hurdle
would be a disaster.
This creek is
a really eerie place...
A pool enclosed by rainforest
in the heart of nowhere.
I have never felt
so tiny and remote.
The fragility of my safety
has never been so clear.
And to make matters worse,
I'm not alone.
A caiman...
South America's alligator.
Large ones have been known
to attack people.
Although normally quite wary,
this one is
completely unafraid of me...
Testament to how far
from people I've traveled.
I don't want him
to come too close.
But it's no wonder he has made
this creek his home.
It's piranha.
Buzz off. Aah.
It's alive with piranhas.
Actually very frustrating.
Every bait I'm throwing out
is getting attacked.
But unfortunately,
it's by piranhas.
Ah, piranha again.
I'm hoping
that as the light fades,
they will become less active.
But at the moment, I've got
a dwindling supply of bait,
because the piranhas are just
attacking it every time.
My best chance is to wait
until night.
Wade: Salamoni told me
that once the sun sets,
the piranhas run and hide,
because that's when
the wolffish come out to hunt.
It seems that piranhas know
who the real river monster is.
Fish on!
Oh, yeah.
I finally got a wolffish
on my line,
but I'm not the only one
with an eye on my catch.
There's a caiman
right in front of me.
I do the only thing
I can think of...
I'm gonna try and just pull
this up on the side.
With the worst possible result.
Oh [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]
I was trying to pull
the fish up on the side
because the caiman was after it,
and I've lost it.
I've lost it!
Damn!
Should have had that fish.
If that caiman
hadn't been there,
I'd have probably had that fish.
What I was trying to do was just
slide it out on the side here.
Hook came out.
[grunts]
Damn!
I can't risk going back,
even though I know wolffish
are there.
Caiman are territorial,
and it was certainly
not afraid of me.
It will be there again
tomorrow without doubt,
and next time, it might not
just go for the fish.
A 7-foot caiman
could easily attack,
and a severe injury out here
would have serious
ramifications.
But morning gives us
another problem... rain.
The storm makes me
and the whole crew nervous.
We are nearing the end
of the dry season.
When the rainy season starts,
two things will happen...
First, the creeks will flood,
and the fish,
already hard to find,
will disappear
into flooded forest,
making them impossible to catch.
Second,
and possibly more important,
we could become stranded.
The airstrip is upstream,
and it's our only way home.
If the water
gets too high and fast,
we will not be able to get out.
It's a sobering thought,
and it makes me look as much to
the sky as I do to the water.
And I certainly don't want
to test the theory
that lightning never strikes
the same place twice.
The new creek that I'm
targeting is much narrower
and even more surrounded
with snags and tangles
than the previous one.
Oh, it's off.
[groans]
Nothing seems to be
going my way.
All my previous luck
seems to have run out.
Just putting bait on here.
Not getting any response
to artificial,
so I'm putting a lump
of piranha on.
There's been a couple of fish
actually moving in here...
One right underneath
this tangle of branches,
so it's fishing right
in the middle of snags.
In a place like this,
if it gets even a few feet,
it's wrapped itself
around a branch,
so I give it just enough line
to take the bait properly,
and then it's just
try and haul it to the boat.
There's been nothing moving here
now for quite a while,
so I think what I'll do,
I'll go further up the creek
and maybe drop in here later.
Nothing doing here
at the moment.
Wade: The only option left is to
enter this creek at night.
With half-hidden roots
and fallen trees,
navigating this waterway is
a disaster waiting to happen,
and it seems every creek
has its caiman.
To make matter worse,
I hear a rumble of thunder.
[thunder crashes]
My window of opportunity
is about to slam shut.
This could be my last chance
to catch a wolffish.
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
Oh, off, off, off.
No, that could have been
a piranha
that took it into a snag.
I think it could be time
to call it a night.
These things are very active
at the moment.
Wade: With the storm
edging ever closer
and hungry piranha
seemingly beating any wolffish
to my bait,
I'm considering
calling it a night.
But then I make a discovery.
Wait a minute.
I've got a scale here.
I've got a scale.
That looks like
a small wolffish.
The storm is closing in,
but so are the wolffish.
I decide to fish on.
[thunder rumbles]
Here we go.
Here we go.
Finally, a strong take.
It's a wolffish.
The monster I've spent the past
three weeks trying to catch...
And it's a big one.
Over she comes.
Ah!
Fantastic. Here we go.
There's the result.
That's lovely.
So, here we are.
This is the wolffish.
The stories I've heard about
these... absolutely fearless.
Anything comes near them...
Dogs, people...
They'll go for it.
It looks quite gap-toothed.
But actually,
pull those lips back,
and you see there are very spiky
fangs underneath there.
The other thing about it
is the fishing
is just unlike anything
I've done before.
It's real guerilla,
close quarters,
hand-to-hand combat, almost.
Wade: My quest for the wolffish
has pushed me to my limits.
Damn!
It seems appropriate
that I've had to
push deeper and deeper
into the greatest rainforest
in the world
to find the most savage and
untamed river monster to date.
The piranha
gets all the press...
but this guy delivers the goods.
It's well-armed with
a fearsome set of teeth,
but it's also fiery
and fearless,
attacking animals and people
even out of the water.
And I'm convinced
this is the fish
that possibly pound for pound
is the toughest, most monstrous
fish of South America.
There it is... the wolffish.","Hoplias aimara, also known as anjumara, traíra, trahira, manjuma, anjoemara and giant wolf fish, is a species of freshwater fish found in the rivers of South America. In Amazonia, the native populations are concerned by high levels of mercury contamination which have been linked to the consumption of contaminated fish. H. aimara is a good bioindicator of such contamination.


== Description ==
This is the largest of the Hoplias species with specimens caught at a length of 120 cm (47 in), the largest rod and reel record stands at 101 cm (40 in). They can weigh as much as 40 kg (88 lb). This species has an elongated cylindrical shape. the colour is basically brown with a lighter base colour, although shades can vary, with a number of vertical patches or stripes. There are normally small spots visible on the upper anterior part of the body including the head, the patterning can vary geographically. The colour can be almost solid black through to pale brownish gold colour with marked dark stripes. Although it seems docile, the fish has been known to attack divers and swimmers, however there is rarely a fatal ending.


== Taxonomy ==
There were thought to be two species of giant trahiras Hoplias aimara (Valenciennes, 1846) and Hoplias macrophthalmus (Pellegrin, 1907), each described from French Guiana,  study of the type-specimens of each species showed that both names, H. aimara and H. macrophthalmus, referred to the same taxon. The Principle of Priority of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature therefore means that the name Hoplias aimara has precedence.


== Distribution, habitat and ecology ==
Across most of northern South America, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and the island of Trinidad. Often found in counter current zones of principal rivers and creeks. It is mainly an ambush predator of fish but also feeds opportunistically on other animals that fall into the water such as terrestrial invertebrates. Attacks on larger vertebrates including humans are unproven. It is active predominantly at dusk and at night. Reproduction takes place at the onset of the rainy season from December to March. Depending on the size, the female can carry around 6,000 to 60,000 eggs. It is known for the quality of its flesh and populations in many more settled parts of its range have been severely depleted due to fishing for food.

Silent Assassin,Short-Tailed River Stingray,Potamotrygon brachyura,"Wade:
My name is Jeremy Wade,
biologist and extreme fisherman.
I've hunted down freshwater
monsters all over the world...
Hey!
[indistinct shouting]
investigated
macabre human deaths
and savage attacks.
Aah!
It is not often
that I come across a fish
I've not heard of before,
especially when it could be
among the largest freshwater
fish I have ever tackled.
[motor whirring]
I am heading to the remote
northeast corner of Argentina
to catch a monster that
somehow got under my radar...
There it is, there it is,
there it is, there it is,
there it is, there it is!
A creature responsible
for horrific injuries...
It will dissolve the flesh.
[reel whirring]
Ohh!
Even death.
Recently, I heard rumors
of a giant freshwater fish
that, if true, would be
a brand-new species to me,
one that I never knew existed
in a country
that I know little about.
I'm in Argentina.
I'm on my way
to the Paraná River.
It's the second-biggest
river system in South America
after the Amazon.
I know other rivers
in South America very well
and the creatures
that live in them,
but this river is very little
known in the outside world,
and it's also new territory
for me.
And most important,
this river harbors a killer.
A little while ago,
I heard about a child who died
as a result of encountering
something in the water.
[girl humming]
A 12-year-old girl was playing
close to her village
on one of the remote islands
set in this huge river.
She had entered the water
countless times before,
but this time,
it would be different.
This time, there was something
waiting in the shallows
only yards from the bank.
The attack was brief
but ferocious.
Aah!
Aah!
She stood no chance
against such weaponry.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
She died soon after
in her mother's arms...
Killed by a freshwater monster.
[engine shuts off]
The evidence from the death
points to one suspect...
Shallow water, piercing barb,
and speed of attack
all suggest a stingray.
But this is freshwater,
and I wasn't aware
that there were stingrays
in this river.
The Paraná River
rises in southern Brazil
and travels through Paraguay,
into Argentina,
before emptying
into the Atlantic
3,000 miles from its source.
The outback town of Bella Vista
lies on the banks
of this great river
500 miles from the sea.
Before the arrival
of the Spanish,
this corner of Argentina
was the land
of the Guarani people.
It is now the home of gauchos,
farmers, and fishermen.
It still has the air
of a frontier town here.
This is where I am basing myself
on my quest for a leviathan.
I meet up with some fishermen
to find out more
about the death of the girl
and the creature that
I am pitting myself against.
Mm-hmm.
And I discover
a lot more than I expected.
[speaking Spanish]
[speaking Spanish]
They tell me about a small boy
who was playing in the river
only a short distance from his
mother when he was attacked.
[speaking Spanish]
Boy: Aah!
There was a commotion
in the water, then silence,
and the boy's lifeless body
floated in the shallows
right where he'd been playing.
[conversing in Spanish]
What they are describing
is a ray
but not one
I've ever come across.
They call it chucho de río,
or river dog.
I've caught giant rays before,
in Thailand...
A massive creature
with a tail like a bullwhip.
But what they're describing
here sounds very different.
And unlike
that estuarine monster,
the chucho de río
has made its home
500 miles from the sea.
And what really makes
this monster different
is that it has killed.
But how? What makes this animal
uniquely dangerous?
I visit the regional hospital
to meet Dr. Gomez,
a surgeon who knows
all about stingray wounds.
[conversing in Spanish]
It's not a clean cut.
You've got these serrations
on the spike,
so what happens...
It makes a mess when it goes in,
and then it also rips the flesh
when it comes out.
The two children
most likely died
because the barb punctured
an artery or vital organ,
and they quickly bled to death.
But that is not
the only cause of death
from this massive stingray.
Dr. Gomez draws the barb,
with its backward-facing
serrations and venom.
Dr. Gomez:
[speaking Spanish]
So, the mucus
that's on the spine,
it doesn't
just contain bacteria.
There is actually
a venom there...
Resulting in deep, putrid wounds
laced with toxins.
The entire outer skin
produces a necrotic venom
which becomes more concentrated
around the tail
and along the barb,
meaning it is literally cloaked
in a venom that destroys tissue.
I head out,
knowing that I'm on the trail
of a creature
with such a fearsome reputation
that the local fishermen
refuse to fish for them.
Jose, my boatman,
is an accomplished fisherman.
He has the all-important
local knowledge
that I always depend on.
His help will be essential
if I am to navigate
this labyrinth
and find the hidden monster.
This river
is a very, very big river.
I was really quite taken aback
by the size of it,
but, as always,
you've got features.
This is a little channel.
And what we've got,
we've got a real push of current
out here.
But, then, that current
sort of eddies around.
There's a nice slack
on that side there,
and it's exactly
the kind of place
where any kind of fish
would hang out
and, then, the predators are
gonna hang out, feeding on them.
Rays are members
of the shark family
but have flattened bodies
and winglike fins.
As yet, I've not been able
to find out any accurate data
about the size
of the chucho de río,
but the fishermen here tell me
they grow very big.
I want to know how big.
Stingrays patrol
the river bottom,
predating on small fish
and invertebrate,
which they locate using sensors
that detect the prey's
minute electrical field.
My gear is too heavy to cast,
so I have to adapt.
For bait,
I'm using armored catfish,
which I float out
underneath a bottle
and I release by pulling
sharply on the line.
Jose has a handline
attached to the bottle,
which he retrieves
after the bait has dropped.
Perfecto.
[chuckles]
I've not got very much lead on.
There's quite a surge
of current here,
but the whole thing
that I was trying to do
was to use the current
to take it down
and then pull it off just
in the slack beside the current,
and that's exactly
what'll happen to a food item.
If you're having to use
loads of lead to keep it down,
then it's not the kind of place
where food is gonna settle.
But I've got a nice sort
of slack bow in the line,
which tells me that that bait
is in a good place.
This is the same rod
that I took to South Africa,
where I caught
two 500-pound bull sharks.
In Thailand,
I felt the full force
of the ray's strength...
It's spinning the boat.
It's taking the boat down.
But also the disappointment
of losing what, to this day,
could be the biggest fish
I've ever had on my line.
Ohh!
I am not going to let
the same thing happen again.
So, armed with what I learned
out there,
I prepare
to catch myself a monster.
Oh, here we go, here we go.
Here we go,
here we go, here we go.
That's...
Something's
really after that there.
Something's really after it.
There's a disturbance
at the surface.
And then nothing.
Hmm. I may or may not
have a bait left.
Jose thinks that could have been
a small ray,
maybe having trouble
getting the bait in its mouth.
Here we go,
here we go, here we go.
[reel whirring]
That's actually fairly unusual.
When I attempted
to set the hook there,
there was nothing there,
but I left the bait in position,
and literally,
within a minute or so,
something was back at it, so
it suggests there's lots of...
Lots of fish down there.
So just check that I've, uh...
Got the bait.
Ah.
There we go.
So, the bait is actually gone.
Something
actually pulled it off.
Whatever is down there
seems to be onto me.
It's gone very quiet.
I'm forced
to try another location.
Yeah, well, that bait lasted...
About a minute,
something like that.
It started off
as a vicious tapping,
and then off it went.
One after another,
my baits are stolen.
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna catch anything,
though that isn't new, eh?
Something down there
is outsmarting me,
removing the bait even before
I can get it to the bottom.
You know,
always there's this conflict
between do I just stick it out,
carrying on doing
what I'm doing...
Or do I change something?
And you have to sort of reach
a happy medium with that.
You have to sort of
give something a good go,
but be prepared to change
if, you know, it looks like
you're doing something wrong.
[reel whirring]
[grunts]
Something on there, I think.
Oh, it's a piranha.
It's a piranha.
Wow.
Right, what's happened there
is that the bait's
been chopped in half,
and then I foul-hooked a piranha
in the back.
I think it's fairly clear
that this is what's been
taking my bait.
And, you know,
talk about caught red-handed.
There's the evidence.
Chunky, chunky piranha.
I've not actually caught
this kind of piranha before.
They call it palometa here.
It's very similar
to the red-belly
piranhas in the amazon.
It's got
that orangey throat area,
very, very solid, muscular head.
Um...
It's a very serious piranha,
that.
There are killers of all sizes
patrolling this river.
[motor whirring]
But it is said that the people
who live along its banks
fear stingrays
more than any other.
Mm.
It's a great viewpoint here.
Whenever possible,
I like to look down on a river.
You really can just see
so much more.
And what's really apparent here
is what looks like
the opposite bank
when you're down
at water level...
Actually, that's just an island.
There's loads of islands here.
What's also interesting here,
I can see there's a couple
of houses dotted around.
And I think it's very important
that I go and talk
to those people.
These are the people
who can tell me
not just where to go
and try to catch fish,
but they might have heard,
as well,
about these incidents
that I've heard about.
These people
live a nomadic existence.
During the wet season,
their ranches
are submerged underwater.
They spend months
cut off from the outside world.
At a ranch on an island,
I talk with a group of gauchos
who explain the dangers
of living in such isolation,
alongside one of the river's
most feared predators.
[conversing in Spanish]
Yes, you know,
there are stingrays here.
[conversing in Spanish]
I just asked,
""Do you know anybody
who's ever been wounded by one?""
""Yes, yes, you know,
not just people,
but also cows and horses, too.""
[conversing in Spanish]
He said
they have known horses to die
as a result of a blood vessel
being punctured.
[horse neighs]
[conversing in Spanish]
But also, they've had other
horses die from infection.
[speaking Spanish]
He says it's almost
as if the horses are crying
because the pain is so bad.
[horse neighs]
The first place I've stopped...
Yes, there are rays here,
and not just people
but also large animals
have actually been killed
by these rays.
I'm after a creature
that can kill a horse...
yet is virtually unknown
to the outside world.
Rays have a finely tuned
sensory system
which they use to locate prey.
But these sensors could also
detect my thick line and hook.
So by changing to finer gear,
I hope to fool the ray
into taking my bait.
I'm gonna scale down, and, uh...
That's just a bit finer.
Still very strong... 175-pound
breaking strength, that.
This is the main line here.
It's not gonna create
a lot of drag
when it moves through the water.
The current's not gonna
pick it up.
I'm actually quite pleased
with that setup.
I give it one more go
in the hope
that, as evening falls,
the piranhas will stop feeding.
[reel whirring]
[grunts]
Nothing, nothing.
That's very odd.
[imitates reel whirring]
Stop.
Ding, dun, dun, dun.
[speaking Spanish]
Piranhas are still active
by the look of it.
Cursed by piranhas.
It is vital to understand
the behavior
of the other fish in the river
besides your quarry
in order to avoid
the other species,
like the omnipresent piranha.
To remove these sight hunters
from the equation,
I begin fishing at night.
[insects chirping]
I set my line,
now confident it is past
piranha feeding time.
[grunts]
Nothing.
So much for that plan.
Another one bites the dust.
But I feel as though the noose
is tightening.
I am closing in.
So I further fine-tune
my approach.
I discard the bottle
and begin casting,
dropping the bait
quickly to the river bottom,
reducing the amount of time
it's hanging around in midwater.
Now will I finally be rid
of the curse of the piranhas?
[reel whirring]
There. See that?
[grunts]
It feels like a piranha,
but it's too big for a piranha,
I think.
[reel whirring]
Wade: Ah. Look at that.
So much for piranhas
not feeding at night.
[sighs]
These Paraná River piranhas
are among the largest
and most ferocious
I have ever come across.
And it's so big, I can't really
get my hand around it.
I've encountered
piranhas before.
I know that,
in the right conditions,
they are capable of attacking
and devouring the largest prey
in seconds.
I don't think I particularly
want to fall in here.
Piranhas. Big piranhas.
But also active at night.
It shows just how hungry
everything is in here.
I fish for hours...
That's really kicking.
Ah.
I think that's a...
Is that a piranha?
Only to pull in
one piranha after another,
each as big as the last.
That could be time to call it...
Call it a night
if these guys are active.
But it's hard to give up
when I know the monster
stingray must be down there.
Wonder what this is.
Ooh.
Ooh, look at that.
[grunts]
So, this is a sort of...
This is a predatory catfish.
This is a small one.
These things grow...
Oops.
Ohh. They grow over 100 pounds.
So, you know,
5 or 6 foot long...
But, I mean... [blows]
The thing about this fish for me
is, you know, it's a catfish,
but it's a very athletic,
streamlined catfish.
It's a catfish
that hunts actively.
This one's got
quite spiky fins there,
so I ought to be careful.
Ohh.
Ow! [bleep]
That's just dug its spine
right in the back of my hand.
That went right... oh, my God.
I've handled these fish actually
like loads of times before.
This is the first time I've been
stabbed by one of these.
It kicked, and it just...
That was its pectoral spine
going in the back of my hand.
Although painful,
these catfish spines
do not have a venom.
What this is making me think
about is I'm gonna have to try
and deal with a stingray
at night.
And, you know, just a moment's
loss of concentration
with a small catfish...
And that's the result.
In the Amazon,
stingrays are known
as ""wish you were dead"" fish
because of the agonizing pain
following a stab from the barb.
Even though stingray meat
is good to eat
and a large ray
could feed many people,
fishermen here
refuse to hunt them.
The next morning, I meet
fellow fisherman Donal Pereira,
who hooked one accidentally.
A momentary lack
of concentration,
and he felt the full force
of the stingray's barb.
[speaking Spanish]
So, he was actually fishing
for one at the time,
so he wasn't walking
in the water.
He actually had one on the line
from the...
Fishing from the bank.
And then when he pulled it in,
he lifted it up,
and suddenly,
it just whipped its tail around.
[conversing in Spanish]
This happened 30 years ago,
and there's still
a very obvious scar there.
And he's telling me,
and I've sort of...
I didn't believe it at first.
Like, I wanted to hear it again.
Six or seven years to heal.
It was suppurating
for that amount of time.
You know, from just one moment
of being stabbed,
six, seven years
of a nasty wound
taking all that time to heal.
Necrosis can lead to gangrene.
The death of one cell
quickly cascades,
spreading
to the surrounding cells,
killing everything around it.
Following envenomation,
the victim suffers severe pain,
vomiting, paralysis, tremors,
even heart failure...
And, if not treated, death.
As I head back to my boat,
I come across a macabre sight...
My first encounter
with the chucho de río.
But this is not the way
I was hoping to see it.
[wood creaking]
[conversing in Spanish]
The lad in the boat just said,
""What a monstrous animal.""
It is very much like an alien.
It doesn't look like
any normal fish.
The guts have been taken out.
No tail.
Tail's been hacked off on this.
And this is actually a
fish that I didn't know
existed until I came here.
I've known for ages that you get
stingrays in freshwater,
but this particular species...
We're talking about
a very short time
that I've known this existed,
and here is the evidence
in the flesh.
I mean,
there's no doubt about it.
This is a very, very
creepy-looking fish.
You've got these fine denticles
all over the body
like miniature teeth.
Some of them are more enlarged.
As we get to the tail,
look at that.
That's starting to get
some really serious, sharp,
lumpy denticles there.
You know, that's quite apart
from the spine
you've got on the back,
which is just, like, this
sort of dirty, serrated blade.
So, I mean, this animal,
it's not just the tail...
This is just, like, a...
Very lethally armed animal.
This stingray is much bulkier
than the one
I caught in Thailand,
which was flatter, more slight.
That's a good 48-inch wingspan.
The power of this massive body
is transmitted to the tail.
Just measuring
the size of the tail,
as well as the size
of the animal.
4 inches across, so that's quite
a serious club-like weapon,
never mind
the big spike in the end.
One tipped
with tissue-destroying venom.
Now, to find out the true
weight of the chucho de río.
[grunting]
It's registering
just over 200 pounds there,
and of course
it's missing the tail,
and it's missing all the guts,
and it's been out in the sun
dehydrating and bleeding.
So it's something like 225
when this was alive.
You know, I think we can be
fairly safe about that.
A genuine river monster.
But if the stories are true,
then there are even bigger
fighters out there.
That is what I'm after...
To see for myself
the weaponry and the behavior
that makes this creature
a killer.
This body of water is vast.
I've been here now
for nearly two weeks,
and Jose and I have scoured
the area without any results,
so I can't restrict myself
to fishing just at night.
I have to get a bait
in the water as often as I can.
The river's got a very different
character to it today.
There's this wind
blowing upstream,
and what that does,
it's creating
these standing waves here
about 3 foot high.
It actually turns into
quite an intimidating place.
And there is so much
competition for food,
especially from
the ever-present piranhas
feeding 24/7.
Well, I just cast the bait out,
and there was instantly
something on the bait...
But it just felt like piranhas.
It was like [imitates gobbling]
like that coming through,
whereas, what I actually want is
something that just goes [chomp]
[reel clicking]
[grunts]
[reel whirring]
Feels like a piranha.
But the Paraná River
is full of surprises.
Ah.
It's a different kind
of catfish.
This looks like
a new species for me,
although it's very similar to
one I've caught in the amazon.
Yeah, there we go.
That's a different fish.
And again,
it's just another fish
that is going to,
you know, polish off my baits.
You know, it really is a problem
actually just having a bait
down there
that's gonna survive long enough
for the stingray,
which is very much
the top predator
that'll come along and find it.
[motor whirring]
Big strikes often come
when you least expect them.
So I have to stay prepared
for when my rod bends double
with the weight
of a 250-pound monster.
[reel whirring]
Here we go.
That's a fish.
There's a fish on.
This is by far the biggest fish
yet to take my bait.
It's coming close. Here he is.
There it is.
There it is. There it is.
That's a stingray.
At last, my first glimpse
of a live chucho de río.
He's off the bottom,
but there's trees down here.
Although
this is only a juvenile,
it is still armed
with a deadly barb
and tissue-destroying venom.
That's a long way off yet,
but...
I don't want to bring this
into the boat,
so I ask Jose
to head for the nearest beach.
[speaking Spanish]
I put on knife-proof
kevlar gloves
to protect me against the barb.
I'll just pull it up.
As soon
as it's out of the water,
its tail is aiming for me.
I noticed that this ray
is a heavier build
than other rays I've caught...
and the tail much shorter,
more like a dagger than a whip.
I'm gonna see
if I can get a look at that.
The ray's tail
is coated with toxic venom.
Just gonna see
if I can get any mucus off here.
General fish slime.
That's just sort of slime,
that's mucus,
but living in there you've got
a cocktail of bacteria.
I'm actually thinking about
what those cowboys were saying.
They've had horses die
from fatal bleeding
but also from the infection
when they've stepped on a ray.
[grunts]
That's actually one heavy beast.
And that's the...
I'm just feeling
the weight of this animal now,
and this is a small one.
I'm just thinking,
a weapon like that
with 400, 500, maybe 600 pounds
behind it.
You know, it's like
somebody coming at you
with a medieval mace, in a way.
It's like a club
with a nail in it.
Anyway, let's get it back.
Easing it
into slightly deeper water.
Now, just looking at the pattern
of this, and just, you know,
it does just completely
disappear into the background.
It really does bring home
how dangerous potentially
these things are
when you just see
how they're just almost
invisible in the water.
That was actually a small one.
What I want to see now
is a big one of those,
but if I do get one,
I think I'm really gonna
have my hands full.
[birds squawking]
I've been trolling this river
now for 10 days straight,
and I'm beginning to think
that the only giant ray
I'm going to see
is the one
hanging on the riverbank.
So I'm fishing all the hours
I can to maximize my chances.
[reel whirring]
[grunts]
Look at that. Dorado.
Jose and I fish
all over the river.
This is a mandube catfish.
Mystery bait remover.
That's another night
with no stingrays.
They're proving elusive.
I've caught everything
except what I came for.
Now I try something
that I wouldn't normally do.
I've got a second rod out.
A lot of people in the town
are giving me advice,
what I need to be doing,
and one of the things
that keeps cropping up
is, ""You haven't got
enough lines in the water.""
I don't totally hold with that.
I don't necessarily believe
that two rods gives you
double the chance,
but it all comes down
to just one bait
being in the right place.
Even though I've given in
to using two rods,
only one is really strong
enough to land a monster.
If the lighter rod
happens to hook a fish,
I could be outgunned.
[reel clicks]
[reel whirring]
[grunts]
That's a good fish.
That's a good-sized fish.
This feels like a ray.
Uh...
Just my luck, the fish took
the bait on the lighter outfit,
which isn't really
up to the job.
[sighs] This is bigger
than the last one, for sure.
In Thailand, a giant ray
snapped a rod that
wasn't right for the job...
Something I really don't want
to happen again.
On the limit of what this gear
can hold, really.
Yeah, that's moving.
It's moving.
Plus, it looks like
the river bottom is littered
with dead trees.
One snag, and this fish is gone.
I'm off a very snaggy island
at the moment.
If we can just slowly,
slowly go down in the current,
then we're clear of that,
and we're...
We're then adjacent to a beach.
And also,
the current's slack there.
We can just very slowly coax it
into shallow, slack water.
Because the ray took the bait
on the weaker rod,
I have limited pulling power.
So I'm in for the long haul.
It's now been on
well over an hour.
At last, I've got past
the piranhas, catfish,
and dorado.
But the creature
on the end of the line
might be twice my size,
and it isn't going to
give itself up easily.
2 hours and 10 minutes now.
This is becoming
a war of attrition.
Which will crack first...
The ray, the rod, or me?
Ooh, yes. Yes.
After 11 grueling days
of fishing,
I've hooked what could be
the biggest totally freshwater
river monster
I've ever had on my line.
It feels like it has come
unstuck from the bottom
a couple of times,
but most of the time
it's just a dead weight.
Every now and again,
there's a slight movement,
it rises, and then
it sort of sticks down again.
Rays stick themselves
to the bottom.
Prying them off is like pulling
the plug out of the river.
This just feels like
a dead weight... a dead weight.
It could be in a tree.
It could be in a tree.
It's using all its bulk
and the flow of the river
to defeat me.
What I'm gonna do is just take
the boat upstream a little bit,
and I'm just gonna apply
some pressure
just from the other side,
'cause if it is in a snag,
possibly...
If I can just get
a different angle on it.
Jose has to maneuver
very precisely
in the strong current.
That's the tail hitting
the line. Tail hitting the line.
With a fish like this,
I'm not in control.
All I can do is react.
Three hours.
This is my longest battle ever,
beating even
the South African bull shark
that took 2 hours
and 45 minutes.
My back and arms
are now burning.
[groaning]
That is fish, I think.
That is fish, that is fish,
that is fish, that is fish.
It's back. My maneuver worked.
So, a bit of tactics there.
Nothing was happening.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
And I think it might have just
hooked the line 'round a branch,
so we just changed the angle
of the pull slightly.
Look at that.
There it goes. There it goes.
That's good. That's good.
I want to get it to the beach
where I can handle it safely,
but that means coaxing it
200 yards further downstream.
We've got literally
just 10, 15 feet from the bank.
As the creature tires,
I have it
exactly where I want it.
There it is, there it is,
there it is, there it is,
there it is, there it is!
Finally, after perhaps
the most punishing battle
I have ever had,
I land one
of the biggest, strongest,
and most alien freshwater fish
I've ever seen.
The thing I really want to do
with this one, though,
is get a closeup of the tail.
I mean, obviously,
not too close.
And to think this is a fish
that until recently
I didn't even know existed.
The chucho de río is unlike
any other ray I've come across.
Okay, 50""...
Nearly 53"".
Which would make it
easily 250 pounds.
But what really makes
this species stand out
is that it is a killer
with a weapon as brutal
as a medieval mace,
like a club fortified
with rusty nails,
which it drives in
with its massive bulk.
I might actually
just kneel on top of the animal.
Uh...
Okay.
[grunts]
That's what I wanted to look at.
The dead animal I saw
had its tail chopped off.
This one has its sting intact.
It's got two stings on there,
and, also, by the look of it,
you know, this can come
a long way on either side.
It's also very flexible.
So I wouldn't want
to get anywhere near this.
Time to put this
back in the water.
My arms are just aching so much.
I've been fishing solid
for 11 days.
If this feels anything
like I do, it's very tired.
What I'm about to do know
is actually very significant,
because this is a fish...
And I always like
to return fish alive...
But this is a fish
where, you know, the locals
don't give it any quarter.
This stingray has evolved to
survive in totally freshwater.
In fact, it is now thought
to be incapable
of living in the sea.
Just bent over it here,
I'm just not seeing
the shape of the fish at all.
I've just got
this huge, broad back
with this amazing pattern on it.
As fish go, it has to be one
of the strangest fish there is.
And in a river, as well... you
know, the size of this thing.
I've been fishing the world's
rivers now for four decades,
but landing a monster like this
makes me wonder
what else is out there
still to discover.","The short-tailed river stingray (Potamotrygon brachyura) is a species of river stingray (family Potamotrygonidae) native to the Río de la Plata Basin in South America. It is sometimes known as the giant freshwater stingray, but this name is typically used for Urogymnus polylepis.
Growing to a disc diameter of about 1.9 m (6.2 ft) and a weight of 220 kg (490 lb), with unconfirmed records of even larger specimens, the short-tailed river stingray is the largest freshwater species in its family and one of the heaviest strict freshwater fish in South America, only matched by the arapaima (Arapaima) and piraíba catfish (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum). The primary threat to the short-tailed river stingray is fishing for food and as a game fish (if not released), but it is also under pressure from habitat loss and occasionally caught for aquaria.


== Description ==
The short-tailed river stingray is circular in shape and humped in the back. The species can reach about 1.9 m (6 ft) in disc diameter and 220 kg (490 lb) in weight, making it the largest freshwater species in the family Potamotrygonidae. They have a dark pattern on their backs, probably used as camouflage. The ray's tail is very muscular and thick, covered with short spines at the base and a venomous sting at the end.


== Distribution ==
The short-tailed river stingray is found in the Río de la Plata Basin, including the Paraguay, Paraná and Uruguay Rivers in the countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It may also range into Bolivia in the Pilcomayo River (a tributary of the Paraguay River), but this remains unconfirmed. In the north it ranges from the upper Paraguay River basin, including the Pantanal, and south to the lowermost freshwater sections of the Río de la Plata. Unlike some other freshwater rays, it has not been able to spread to the upper Paraná River basin after the Itaipu Dam flooded the Guaíra Falls, which represented a natural barrier to its range.


== Lifestyle ==
Female short-tailed river stingrays give birth to up to 19 fully formed young stingrays per litter. The pups start off eating plankton and then move on to consume small mollusks, crustaceans, the larvae of aquatic insects, and fish.

The Mutilator,Red-Bellied Pacu,Piaractus brachypomus,"Wade: Papua New Guinea, a land
renowned for cannibalism,
macabre rituals, headhunters,
and bitter tribal conflict.
But now something new
is ripping through the heart
of this island...
Aah!
A creature
that is tearing chunks
from unsuspecting fishermen,
devouring certain body parts.
My name is Jeremy Wade,
biologist and extreme fisherman.
I've spent my life searching
for freshwater monsters.
Wade: Those teeth!
I'm heading to Papua New Guinea
to find out
what has acquired the taste
for one particular part
of the human body.
Wade: Details about the
attacks are unclear.
All I have to go on
are a few sketchy reports
from newspapers and internet.
The incidents first surfaced
in the Australian press,
which reported two separate,
but very similar, fatal attacks
in the Sepik River
in the remote northern region
of Papua New Guinea.
Patrick Mo had just returned
from a long day on the water.
He was bathing
in the river margins
right in front of his house
when it struck.
He was hit by a powerful
lone hunter...
A fast swimmer
with jaws like a vice
that ripped and tore his flesh.
[screaming]
Mo had certain body parts
bitten off,
as a result of which
he bled to death.
Wade: A second attack
was eerily similar.
Frances Samben went to the river
to wash dishes and cool off,
something he had done
countless times before,
but this time,
it was to be very different.
This time,
he's not be going home.
Aaah!
I've tracked freshwater killers
all over the world,
but this is my first visit
to Papua New Guinea,
which lies north of Australia,
where the Coral Sea
meets the South Pacific.
It is one of the most dramatic
and untouched islands
anywhere on Earth.
Despite more than 50,000 years
of human habitation,
this landscape has changed
little since prehistoric times.
Much remains unexplored.
New species
are regularly discovered.
So is the river killer
a new arrival,
or has it been hiding away
for centuries?
It is only now
that I begin to realize
the sheer size of this island
and the remoteness of the area
where I'm heading.
There's just an awful lot
of forest out there.
I'm used to flying
over forest in the Amazon,
but this is very different.
While the Amazon tends to be
very flat, most of it,
here we're talking
serious mountains
and just completely cloaked
in greenery.
The other thing is, in the
Amazon, if you look carefully,
you did see buildings
down there.
You can see tin roofs
occasionally glinting
back at you,
and clearings in the trees,
but here,
just none of that at all.
It appears to be completely
uninhabited down there.
Wade:
These steep-sided mountains
and impenetrable forests
led to isolation and diversity
among its plants and animals,
and suspicion and bitter tribal
conflict between its people.
Tribal fighting still exists
in the less-accessible
mountain regions.
But right now, it is the water
level that concerns me.
We're now approaching the
floodplain of the Sepik River.
And there's a lot
of water there.
This is supposed to be now
into the dry season,
but I'm still seeing
lots of water
not just confined
in the banks of the river,
but spreading
throughout the landscape.
And the fish and everything else
in the water
are gonna be very spread out,
and it's gonna make
my job pretty difficult.
Wade: Rising
in the central mountains,
the Sepik River snakes
for over 700 miles
through impenetrable forest.
This is one of the last
great unexplored rivers.
It is to Papua New Guinea
what the Congo is to Africa
and the Amazon is
to South America.
After four flights,
48 hours, and 9,000 miles,
I arrive in Ambunti
in the remote northwest corner
of the country.
I've never been here before,
so I'm not too sure
what I'm getting into.
There's no roads here.
So I think the stuff's coming
out of the plane now
and then it's on to the water.
My base for the next two weeks
is a village deep
in the heart of the forest.
These tribes are cut off
from the outside world.
The only way in or out
is along this river.
Little has changed here
for centuries.
Their culture is rich
in superstition,
myths, and mystery.
And they are notoriously wary
of outsiders.
I'm met by one of the elders.
I sent word of my intended
visit many months ago.
Turning up unannounced
is not taken kindly.
I do my best to smile
and look friendly...
But I'm not getting
much reaction.
So, this is Spirit House?
Yes. Spirit House.
Wade: This was once the site
of human sacrifice
and even cannibalism.
Now it is the place of worship
and ceremony,
and where outsiders are called
when they visit.
But I'm not too sure
how welcome I am.
I've, um...
Been hearing stories
about something in the water
attacking people.
Is this something
that you know anything about?
Yes.
So, what is happening?
[speaking pidgin]
There are over 700 languages
in Papua New Guinea,
but the trade language
common to all is pidgin.
They also understand
a little English.
The thing about pidgin
is that there are English words
that are recognizable,
and in the middle of that
was a phrase...
Ball cutter.
There's something in the water
called a ball cutter,
and this does agree very much
with the stories
that I've heard.
People have been
coming out of the water
with injured genitals.
It's interesting.
The first place
that I've asked...
""Yes, yes, we know about this.
There is very something
dangerous in the water.""
So, these injuries,
people being attacked,
is this something
that has happened here?
[speaking pidgin]
So it sounds like this is
something they heard about here,
but nobody here
has actually been attacked,
or at least not yet anyway.
And they're saying the stories,
coupled with the name
of this animal, the ball cutter,
you know, it is something
that they are afraid of,
they're very worried about.
Particularly mothers
are very concerned
that their children are
very careful in the water.
Wade: For villagers living here,
avoiding the river
is virtually impossible.
Their lives revolve around it.
Now, somewhere down there,
is a creature with teeth sharp
enough to emasculate a man,
causing him to bleed to death
in minutes.
I've investigated
similar incidents before.
[drag unwinds]
Fish on!
Look at that!
Wade: In central Africa,
I caught a goliath tigerfish,
a species that has attacked
and killed people
in the Congo River.
What we've got to worry
about now,
is he biting his way out?
But that is 9,000 mile away,
and goliaths are not found
around here.
The village elders told me
that none of the native
fish species
would be capable of inflicting
such horrific injuries.
But something out there
is responsible
for these fierce attacks.
And I have no idea
what it could be.
I've not been here before,
so I don't know what fish
I'm likely to catch.
But what I'll probably do,
I'll probably start off light...
Light line, a little hook,
and a small bit of bait,
and try and catch
some small fish.
That will start to give me
a picture of what's down there.
And then what I'll do,
I will try and move on to fish
further up the food chain,
that are feeding
on those little fish,
and catch the predators.
I've got a selection
of artificial lures
which resemble small fish,
but I might also just put
a bit of dead fish on my line.
I've got some bigger hooks
for that,
and because predators are
very likely to have teeth,
I've got some wire along,
as well.
So basically,
I've just got a bag of bits,
and I'll sort of make it up
as I go along.
But starting with the small ones
and gradually working my way
up the food chain.
I've not been able to find out
exactly where the attacks
took place,
but I do know that they
occurred close to a village,
so that is where I begin.
A bit of coconut as bait.
The villagers have told me
that the fish around here
find coconut irresistible.
I'm fishing
right in front of the houses.
Two reasons, really...
Fish often come very close
to where people are,
because that's where people
wash their dishes,
all that kind of thing.
Also, shallow water.
Fish, contrary
to popular belief,
tend to be found very often
in the shallows,
rather than in the deep.
There's more light there,
therefore more vegetation,
therefore there's more food.
And in no time at all,
I get a bite.
Oh!
That's taking line
off the clutch.
Strong, strong fish.
Oh! Oh!
Aaah.
Let's have a look.
Something's actually...
That didn't break the line.
I wasn't putting
that much pressure on that.
Now that has actually cut it.
Something down there
has cut the line.
Um... that's interesting.
I was fishing
very, very close to the side,
and there's something down there
with teeth.
What's interesting, though...
It actually took
a bit of coconut.
So you've got a vegetarian
with teeth.
Word has reached me of an
incident in a nearby village.
Ramson Tero was attacked
while paddling his canoe,
but his attacker wasn't a fish.
It was a 20-foot crocodile.
What happened was that Ramson
was collecting palm fronds
for roofing his house.
And the first thing he knows
is that a crocodile has
actually come from underneath.
[speaking pidgin]
He didn't see the body
of the croc at all.
But it came along and just
crunched one end of the boat.
[gasping]
The size of the crocodile's jaws
were more or less
the length of his arm,
and he said he could have put
his arm right down its throat.
That was the size of it.
At that point, he's thinking,
""Well, how do I
get out of this?""
Ramson sat it out in the tree...
Until the crock
eventually lost interest...
And he was able to get away
on his broken canoe.
[speaking pidgin]
He was lucky.
Over the years, dozens of people
have been killed by crocodiles
in the Sepik River.
This skin came
from a 20-foot monster,
said to have learned
to flip over canoes.
Sepik River crocodiles
certainly have a history
of killing,
but are they the ball cutter
I'm looking for?
The elders told me they doubt
the native fish species here
are capable of inflicting
these injuries,
but something
did bite through my line,
so I have to keep an open mind.
I head out
with Alphonse Mavasanye,
a fisherman
and crocodile specialist,
to see if somehow a crocodile
could be responsible
for these unusual mutilations.
He has brought me to the same
area where Ramson was attacked.
Alphonse is actually going to
try and call
this crocodile to us.
The splashing mimics the sound
of a large crocodile
moving quickly
through the water.
[squeaking]
The call, that of a young one.
Both sounds should attract
crocodiles to us.
Ramson described the croc
that attacked him
as being over 20 feet long.
Wade: But they kill
by ripping and spinning,
tearing at flesh and devouring
huge chunks at a time.
[growling]
So it is unlikely
that a large croc
would only attack the genitals.
But could it be a smaller one?
Or is something else
lurking down there?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See the eyes just on the edge
of this bit of vegetation here,
about 20, 30 yards
in front of the boat now.
Dense floating islands
of vegetation...
Perfect crocodile habitat.
It's right in the vegetation.
They can stay submerged
for over an hour.
You don't know they're there
until they attack.
Each time we spot one,
it spooks and disappears.
They seem very wary.
But eventually,
Alphonse grabs a baby one.
[squeaking]
So this one's a salty?
One year?
So this could belong
to the big one?
Yeah.
This could be
one of the children?
One of the children
for the big one.
So, the squeaking noise...
What is the squeaking noise?
- Is it really?
- Yes.
So you think
it may be a good idea
to put it back now?
- Yeah, yeah.
We can put it back.
I can't be certain
that crocs are not responsible
for the attacks,
but Alphonse tells me
that they're rarely seen
near villages now.
And both the genital attacks
occurred close
to the victims' houses.
I think something else
in this water
has a taste for human flesh.
We saw one crocodile tonight,
I suppose an animal
about 8 or 10 foot,
something like that,
judging by the amount of light
coming back from the eyes.
But other than that,
it's just been small ones,
and I suppose, in one sense,
a bit of a relief not to come
across the big one,
but in another sense,
I'm quite disappointed
and also surprised
that we haven't seen
more crocodiles tonight.
Alphonse tells me
that in recent years,
crocodile numbers are down,
and it is only
in the past few years
that the attacks on people
have occurred.
Could it be that whatever
is attacking the fisherman
is also attacking
the crocodiles?
The next morning,
I set off again
on the edge of the village.
I'm on the Sepik River,
in a remote part
of Papua New Guinea,
9,000 miles from home,
on the trail of a creature
that is attacking
unsuspecting fisherman.
Blimey!
Strong, strong fish.
I can hardly believe my eyes
when I see what is on the end
of my line.
Looks like a piranha.
It has got teeth,
but they're not piranha teeth.
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
that looks like a fish
that I know from the Amazon
called a pacu.
The thing that gives it away
is looking at the teeth.
They're not cutting teeth.
They are grinding teeth.
I actually had my line cut
a few days ago
by a mystery fish
here in the lakeside.
I'm actually seeing this now.
I think
this is what it could be.
Although they're grinding teeth,
they have got
quite sharp ridges on it.
And I think this is what
it could have been.
Wade: Unlike a piranha,
these teeth are not designed
for slicing through flesh.
They are primarily vegetarian.
They feed on things like nuts
that fall in the water.
So, very interesting catch,
but I don't think
this is actually the fish
that I'm after.
Phew.
What's it doing here?
The pacu is typically found
on the other side of the world
in South America,
and doesn't belong in the Sepik.
Puzzled, I meet up
with Alphonse again.
I just wondered
if you can tell me
what this fish is doing here.
You said ""produced.""
It was put here?
So it's a new fish to give
people something else to eat?
Yeah, yeah.
Wade: I've investigated
introduced species before
and know the devastating impact
they can have on a river.
Absolutely stiff with fish.
In the U.S., silver carp
escaped from a fish farm.
Their numbers exploded,
and they now dominate
entire stretches
of the Illinois River.
I feel the boat being buffeted
as they're banging into it.
The wels catfish was moved
from the cold rivers
of northern Europe
to the warm, rich waters
of Spain,
where they grew into monsters.
With no natural predators
and ample food,
both species have run amok,
upsetting the natural balance.
So could something like this
now be happening
in the Sepik River?
Word of my quest is spreading
through the nearby villages.
I've been told of a fisherman
named Nick Sarkat,
who was savaged by something
in the river
which wasn't a crocodile.
Wade: And then what you saw,
the size of the bite,
that was also similar to
human teeth, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- So it looks like a person
has bitten your foot?
- Yes.
What are you thinking
is down in the water?
Whatever is down there
is not only fast and ferocious,
it's also powerful.
Wade:
The village elders told me
that there were only a handful
of fish species out there,
none of them capable
of carrying out such an attack.
I head out further
from the village,
along smaller tributaries.
There has been so little
exploration out here
that new species
are regularly discovered.
Could it be that something
unknown to science
is responsible
for these attacks?
There's something
in the water here
that's actually
attacking people.
What I'm doing now,
I'm fishing to see
if there's anything
predatory down there.
I'm putting a lure on,
and what that will do,
that will flash and wobble,
vibrate,
and that's the kind of movement
that could get a reflex grab,
so something with teeth
is likely to go after this.
I change locations
and try different lures,
but the result
is always the same.
I'm just not getting
any interest at all.
If this was an Amazon lake,
a lake where you didn't have
lots of commercial fishing,
then I'd expect maybe four
or five different species,
certainly some hits,
but just nothing at all.
So it just points to the fact
that there's not a great deal
in the way of predatory fish
in these waters.
Having drawn a blank
in the flooded forest,
as evening closes in,
I head back towards the village.
Each of the attacks occurred
close to where people live.
And the creature has clearly
acquired the taste for flesh.
So what I need is a bait
that tastes just like human,
and considering
their cannibalistic past,
there are many people here
who know just the thing.
Wade: In the days
when the tribespeople here
were cannibalistic,
they called human flesh
""long pig""
because the meat tasted
so much like pork.
So that is what I will use.
It's obviously something that a
predator would be interested in,
but also with moving water here,
what that will do,
that will send a nice oily trail
downcurrent.
So not just anything here, but
if there's anything downstream,
they might sniff that
and move up and investigate.
There he is!
This looks like a pacu.
This is interesting, because
this was on a piece of meat.
So this supposedly
vegetarian fish
has just broken that habit.
This pacu, the piranha's
vegetarian relative,
seems to like
the taste of flesh.
There we go.
So much for the vegetarian pacu.
If the pacu are eating pork,
then they could just
as easily go for human flesh.
Aaah!
So are they now taking on
the behavior
of their deadly relative,
the piranha?
I'm thinking that maybe I might
have dismissed the pacu
as the possible perpetrator
of these attacks too soon.
In its normal habitat,
the Amazon,
it is a vegetarian,
but it certainly
has the weaponry
to inflict serious damage
on flesh.
All it would need
would be a motive.
Now, if it turns out
that there is not enough
of its normal kind of food here,
then it's gonna do
what any animal would do
in that situation,
which is to eat anything it
can find in order to survive.
Where piranhas are concerned,
small means deadly.
But pacu can grow much bigger.
Here in Papua New Guinea,
there's virtually
no commercial fishing,
and there's very little
under the water
in the way of predators,
so it's quite possible
that after only 15 years,
you'd find a bigger pacu
living here
than anything you'd find
in the Amazon.
Wade:
So is this yet another example
of an introduction gone wrong,
especially as the attacks
only started
after the pacu's arrival
in the Sepik River?
In their native South America,
there are 12 or more
fish species
that share the common name pacu.
The one that has been introduced
into Papua New Guinea
is among the largest.
When young, this pacu
mimics the red-bellied piranha.
But as they grow,
they lose their red coloration
and transform
into formidable beasts.
Pacu are armed with jaws
powerful enough to crush the
hard nuts that fall from trees.
These jaws are more than capable
of ripping
through soft human tissue.
If it were to resort
to piranha-type behavior,
this river system
would be forever transformed.
A vegetarian turned carnivore
may be scientifically shocking,
but out here, transformation
is a way of life.
[singing in native language]
Tribespeople turn themselves
into mythical beasts
and carry out hypnotic dances
to ward off evil
or appease the river spirits
when they are in trouble.
Boys all along the Sepik River
are transformed into men
through bloodletting,
by having the skin
on their chests and backs cut,
leaving scars said to be
the teeth marks of crocodiles.
And now, if my hunch is correct,
the pacu is also undergoing
a transformation
from harmless vegetarian
to flesh-eating river monster.
Now my focus is catching a pacu
capable of killing a man.
At the village,
I meet up with Alphonse.
He tells me
that since their introduction,
the pacu have been
devastating the river system.
Wade: So you're saying
that before the pacu was here,
this whole area,
even in the high water like now,
was covered with floating weed,
floating grass.
- Yeah.
- And that's now gone?
Do the crocodiles have
a problem with the pacu?
These floating islands
are the remnants
of what once covered
the entire lake.
The pacu are quite literally
eating the native species
of the Sepik River
out of house and home.
But it is not only the grass
that they are eating.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You've seen that?
- Yeah.
All the fish from this lake...
The tale of destruction
gets worse and worse.
I know the pacu
eat the small fish.
The pacu are eating fish.
They are attacking snakes as
they swim across the surface.
Snakes is what the bird...
Even water birds aren't safe.
Small ducks have been eaten
as they paddle around.
- Duck?
- Duck.
The question is,
does ""everything"" include
a particular part
of the male anatomy?
Aaah!
To find out exactly what
big pacu are capable of,
I need to catch one.
So now I'm changing tack
and heading deeper
into the flooded forest.
Sepik River people
are extremely superstitious
and believe that hostile spirits
reside in the middle
of these forests.
For them,
this is a menacing place.
What we're doing is we're
paddling very, very quietly
through this area
of flooded trees here.
And there's some signs of fish.
I've actually seen some fish
chewing the ends of the weeds
and some fish actually swirling
underneath these nut trees.
So it's just moving slowly
and just casting close
under the trees.
There are signs of pacu
everywhere.
The sound of fruit
hitting the water alerts them
and they race in to eat it.
Wade: Another catch,
but the red coloration tells me
that again, it's a juvenile.
Maybe I have to go further in.
Although I find myself drawn in
to local superstition,
I'm more concerned
about what is lurking
among the root tangles.
The heat in here
is overwhelming,
and the trees
cut out any breeze,
so the humidity is oppressive.
This is very different
from fishing.
By the village,
there, it doesn't matter...
You make a noise,
they're used to the noise.
Here, the only noise
they are listening for
is the sound of falling nuts.
Anything else other than that
is going to scare them away.
Personally, I really enjoy this
sort of close-quarters fishing,
where you're relying on stealth
to get close to the fish.
You're not sort of
making a lot of noise
and just casting a long way.
And the only way you can get
your bait into these areas
is by getting in close.
Another catch,
but this time the pull on the
line suggests a larger pacu.
Not wanting to put my hands
anywhere near those jaws,
I use a long-handled grip
to lift it out.
They're getting bigger,
getting bigger.
The fish's muscular body
makes it capable
of bursts of speed.
It can attack and make a quick
get away without being seen.
That's not the size
that I want to catch.
I want to catch two, maybe three
times the length of that.
But that's good to see anyway.
As evening rolls in,
I head back to the village.
Word has spread
of my investigation,
and a fisherman
has come to see me.
His name, Frances Samben,
is familiar.
[speaking pidgin]
As he talks, I realize
that this is the man
the newspapers claim
was killed by the ball cutter.
Aaah!
The stories that I heard,
he didn't survive the encounter,
but I'm very pleased to say
that in reality,
although this was
a pretty terrifying experience
by all accounts, he did actually
live to tell the tale.
Wade:
Although the rumors of Samben's
death were exaggerated,
the attack did leave him
hospitalized and in agony.
The fish was large
and incredibly powerful.
The bite was not a clean cut
like a piranha's,
but tore and ripped his flesh...
Aaah!
And he struggled
to fight it off.
This echoes the story
told to me by Nick Sarkat.
This giant relative of
the piranha is, as I thought,
growing to quite a size
and with teeth to match.
I begin fishing again,
now fully aware of the strength
of this creature.
But the difficulty will not
be bringing it in
or even landing it.
What worries me most
is getting close to those jaws.
Yeah, yeah, big one,
big one, big one.
There it is.
Look at that!
It's really big.
It's really big.
This could be the one
I've been looking for.
I know there's snags
on the bottom.
I'm trying to keep it
away from that.
Yeah. Just see it.
This black water.
You can just see it down there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yes!
Just keep it away
from stuff on the bottom.
But there's also people's houses
in the water.
Keep it away from that.
For the moment,
it's in open water. That's good.
I'll get it well and truly
tired out
before I try and do anything
with this one.
Then I need to examine it
without losing a chunk
of my hand.
I don't want to rush it.
[grunts]
Oh!
That actually...
Just take a look at that...
As I lifted it out,
that straightened the hook
as I lifted it out.
Ooh!
This is interesting
because I've just been seeing
small ones of these.
That is...
That's a different animal
from what I have been catching.
This is more of a size.
Whew.
So the coloration on this
is actually quite different
from the small ones.
The small ones have
a very dramatic red belly
which, on this,
have sort of faded away
to this rather light orange.
But the biggest
difference... is...
Aah!
Gosh. Very muscular fish.
He just gave
a bit of a kick there.
This is all muscle here.
So it's a very strong fish,
very powerful.
But I'm just... ooh!
I'm just trying to look
at the business end here.
Just look at that.
On the small one, they were
quite delicate teeth.
On here, I mean,
those are real crushers.
What this fish normally feeds on
in the Amazon is seeds and nuts.
They often have tough cases
to be opened.
So these teeth, basically,
they're nutcrackers.
This thing really does look
like a giant piranha.
But the teeth on this,
not designed for cutting,
but for crushing and tearing.
Seeing those teeth reminds me
of all of the stories
I've been told
about the attacks on people.
Aah!
Those teeth really do look
uncannily like human teeth
and to be bitten by those,
I think that would be
a very creepy experience.
It would be just like
being bitten by a person.
They say when a piranha bites
you, when it actually bites,
you don't know it's happening
because it's such a clean cut,
but this would be a very jagged,
messy tear,
and I think you'd certainly
know about this
when this bit you.
And if these fish hear something
splashing in the water,
they don't go heading
in the opposite direction
like other fish.
They come heading for that sound
with those teeth bared.
I'm left in no doubt that
the pacu is the ball cutter...
A vegetarian turned man-eater,
an outsize piranha
with a taste for human flesh,
an alien invader running amok,
dominating entire stretches
of the Sepik River.
The river people now accept
that the ball cutter
is something
they have to live with.
It's just a graphic example
of the unintended side effects
that you can get when you start
meddling with nature.
This nightmare
may seem easy to dismiss
as someone else's problem,
far from our own backyard,
but perhaps not.
Pacu have now turned up
in 19 different states
in the U.S.
So far,
numbers have not exploded,
nor has anyone been attacked.
But just as in the Sepik,
things can change very quickly.
And once the genie
is out of the bottle,
you can never put it back.","Piaractus brachypomus also known as the red-bellied Pacu or pirapitinga, is a large species of pacu, a close relative of piranhas and silver dollars, in the serrasalmid family. It is native to the Amazon basin in tropical South America, but it formerly included populations in the Orinoco, which was described in 2019 as a separate species, P. orinoquensis. Additionally, P. brachypomus is widely farmed and has been introduced to other regions. In South Florida they are invasive in rivers, canals or lakes.
As with a number of other closely related species, P. brachypomus is often referred to as the red-bellied pacu in reference to the appearance of the juveniles. This has resulted in a great deal of confusion about the nature and needs of all the species involved, with the reputation and requirements of one frequently being wrongly attributed to the others.


== Ecology ==

In general, its behavior resembles that of the closely related tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). It is migratory, but the pattern is poorly understood. Spawning occurs at the beginning of the flood season between November and February. Larvae of the Red-Bellied Pacu are found in whitewater rivers, but adults mainly live in flooded forests and floodplains of various river types, including those of both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor. Unlike the tambaqui, the Red-bellied pacu also occurs in the headwaters of nutrient-poor rivers (not just in the lower sections).
It mainly feeds on fruits, seeds, and nuts, but it is opportunistic and will also take zooplankton, insects, crustaceans and small fish, especially in the dry season. In general, more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the red-bellied pacu than the tambaqui, meaning that the former is overall a more efficient seed disperser.


== Appearance ==

Piaractus brachypomus can reach up to 88 cm (2.9 ft) in length and 25 kg (55 lb) in weight.
Juveniles have a distinct red chest and stomach, and are easily confused with the carnivorous red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), but the two can be separated by their teeth, which are molar-like in Piaractus brachypomus. This similarity is believed to be Batesian mimicry by P. brachypomus in an attempt of avoiding predation by other species. Adults lack the bright red chest and belly, and resemble the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), but can be separated by several meristic and morphological features: The Red-Bellied Pacu has a smaller adipose fin that lacks rays, as well as differences in teeth and operculum. The Red-bellied Pacu also has a more rounded head profile (less elongated and pointed). The other member of its genus, P. mesopotamicus, can be distinguished by its smaller scale-size and the higher number of lateral scales (more than 110).


== Connection to humans ==
The Red-Bellied Pacu supports major fisheries and based on a review by IBAMA, it was the 12th most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998 (just after the tambaqui).
The Red-Bellied Pacu is often kept in aquaculture. Hybrids between this species and the tambaqui have been produced in aquaculture. It can also hybridize with P. orinoquensis, but the offspring appears to be sterile.
